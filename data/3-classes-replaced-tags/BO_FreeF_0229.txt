BO FreeF 0229 Someone told me February 29th $ENTITY only comes around once every 4 years on leap day. $ENTITY So where does it go for the other 3 years? $ENTITY Does it just take a super-long nap or something?
BO FreeF 0229 $ENTITY February 29th is a special day that only comes around once every 4 years! $ENTITY It's called leap day! $ENTITY Don't worry, though. $ENTITY There's no actual exercise involved.
BO FreeF 0229 I thought it was the first day of March, $ENTITY but since this year is a leap year, $ENTITY it's actually still February! $ENTITY It's like I got a free day $ENTITY to do whatever I want!
BO FreeF 0229 $ENTITY March starts today! $ENTITY So that means spring is right around the corner! $ENTITY Yessssssss! $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY What do you mean it's still February?! $ENTITY Oh, right. It's leap day! $ENTITY Ugh... What a letdown.
BO FreeF 0229 So February 29th $ENTITY only comes around once every 4 years! $ENTITY The reason why is super complicated. $ENTITY It hurts my head just thinking about it,... .
