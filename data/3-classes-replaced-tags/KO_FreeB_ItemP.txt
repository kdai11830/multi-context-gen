KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY 
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY When I see someone wandering around with an axe, $ENTITY it puts me on guard, even if I know them. A sullen face is scary, of course, but $ENTITY it's even scarier if they're laughing their head off while holding an axe!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Heh heh! $ENTITY Seeing as you've got that slingshot in hand, $ENTITY are you aiming for something in particular?
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oooh?!... That popper you're holding $ENTITY looks like fun!... !

KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Aw man, I thought I saw a present balloon, but it's just you! What a disappointment,... !
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY AH! $ENTITY You got a dandelion puff?!... I really, really want to make a wish and blow on it,... !
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Uh-oh, $ENTITY that was close!... You plan on bopping me with that hammer when my guard's down, don't you?!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Ooooh! $ENTITY Is that a cup of coffee from $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's place?... Darn, now I want a cup too. $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY You really don't know what I'm talking about? $ENTITY If you hit rocks with your shovel, $ENTITY every so often you'll get Bells or find some rare ore. $ENTITY You should give it a try!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY I see.... Just cut me a break, and don't leave holes all over the place!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY #x17;
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Are you out for some light bug catching too? $ENTITY Don't get in my way now!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh!... Are you out here to collect some ice crystals?... Hmm? $ENTITY What am I up to?... I'm on the lookout for a dung beetle, of course! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY where are you, my little snowball roller... 
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY 
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Are you out for a bit of bug catching?... Well, fine! Keep up the good work,... !
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh!... Are you out here to collect some ice crystals? $ENTITY Well, look at you working hard despite the chill!... Brrrrr... So cold!
KO FreeB ItemP .... You haven't caught a single fish yet! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess there's no need to rush it,... !
KO FreeB ItemP .... You still seem like a beginner fisher to me, you know? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess there's no need to rush it,... !
KO FreeB ItemP .... Heh heh. $ENTITY You look like you're hiding some fishing secrets there!... Well, $ENTITY keep up the good work!
KO FreeB ItemP .... Heh. $ENTITY You seem like you really enjoy fishing!... That's great! Glad to hear it,... !
KO FreeB ItemP .... Ho! $ENTITY You seem like you're fishing up a storm!... That's the spirit! Keep at it,... !
KO FreeB ItemP .... Whoa, $ENTITY you've got this master- class-fisher vibe about you!... Impressive stuff,... !
KO FreeB ItemP .... WHOA! $ENTITY Are you telling me you've caught every single fish out there?!... I'm filled with awe!... !
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY So every now and then I see people like you with their umbrellas out, despite the fact it's not raining.... It's a parasol. I'm drying it out. Don't worry about me.
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hmmm?... It's not raining yet. $ENTITY You're too early! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Make sure you check if people are around you or not before you go twirling your umbrella, got it?! $ENTITY The great Eye Poking of '63 is enough to remind anyone of the inherent danger of umbrella twirling!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Ho! $ENTITY So you're one of those types who uses an umbrella in the snow?
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY Using your umbrella in the middle of a cherry-blossom storm.... You're quite the classy character!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Ahhh! $ENTITY So you're trying to avoid a sunburn?!... Sounds like hard work!... Good luck,... !
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Ahhh, $ENTITY so that's what you're doing!... I see... There actually IS a purpose to the wonky behavior! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO FreeB ItemP $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY Sorry about that! $ENTITY I stuck my nose where I shouldn't have.... Just keep doin' what you're doin'!
