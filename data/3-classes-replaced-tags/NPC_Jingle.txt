NPC Jingle $ENTITY Ho ho ho! Happy holidays! $ENTITY Say, kid, you're not from around here, are you? $ENTITY As a holiday messenger, it is my duty to deliver presents to everyone in $ENTITY . $ENTITY Well...everyone who was good this year, anyway. $ENTITY You may see another present messenger in your town. If you do, be sure to ask for a present! It's an easy way to see if you've been good this year! See ya!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Are you enjoying a festive holiday evening?... I really hope so! $ENTITY Say, $ENTITY would you mind standing on my left side when we're talking, kid? $ENTITY I look best from that angle. $ENTITY I sound best from that angle too! $ENTITY 
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Ho ho ho and hey hey hey! $ENTITY Are you out visiting towns tonight? $ENTITY It's such a lovely holiday evening, isn't it? I'm here on business, not pleasure. $ENTITY But it's all the same to me since I love my job! Yeah! $ENTITY I'm a happy little reindeer!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Happy holidays! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY , the black-nosed reindeer! Isn't this the best time of the year, kid? $ENTITY Snow everywhere, fuzzy hats, and steaming mugs of hot cocoa with mushrooms by the fireplace! $ENTITY Wait. Did I say mushrooms?! I meant marshmallows! $ENTITY Mushrooms in hot cocoa would kind of ruin the mood. I'm here in town to do something very important, but it's a secret! $ENTITY I'm going to sneak into everyone's houses and leave them presents!... Don't tell anyone! $ENTITY Um, I know... It's kind of weird if you think about it, $ENTITY but it's all about the presents, so in the end, everyone is happy!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Sometimes I wish I had a good way to mix things up for people, though. $ENTITY If I found someone willing to dress like Santa, I could ask that person to deliver the presents! People like me, but they really LOVE Santa! What a treat it'd be!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Wait just a second. $ENTITY That's a pretty sharp suit you got there, kid. It fits you perfectly! $ENTITY How'd you like to help me out? $ENTITY If you delivered some presents, we could make everyone happier on a whole new level! Sound good? $ENTITY Ho ho yes! Nah, can't do it.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Wait just a second. $ENTITY That's a pretty sharp suit you got there. It fits you perfectly!... I don't know about those shoes...... but to each his own, I suppose! $ENTITY How'd you like to help me out, kid? $ENTITY If you delivered some presents, we could make everyone happier on a much bigger scale! Sound good? $ENTITY Ho ho yes! Nah, can't do it.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY What?! Really?! $ENTITY That's too bad. $ENTITY I was really looking forward to finding a partner who wants to help make people happy. I guess I'll just be a lonely little reindeer this year...
NPC Jingle $ENTITY You will?!... That's great! Thank you so much!
NPC Jingle ... Oh, but this just won't work. $ENTITY Seems you have too many items and can't hold any presents. $ENTITY Please drop at least one item and then come talk to me again!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY That $ENTITY Santa bag $ENTITY is a magical sack filled up with presents for everyone here in town! $ENTITY But $ENTITY at dawn, the magic will break and the bag will return to normal. So please be very careful. The presents the town residents requested are inside that bag... Just think twice when you give out a present, kid. That way, everyone's wishes will be able to come true! $ENTITY I'll be waiting around town until dawn, so deliver all the presents and then return the bag to me. $ENTITY OK, good luck! $ENTITY 
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hmm... I wonder if I can find someone who looks enough like Santa. It'd sure make this $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY extra special... .
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Ho?! $ENTITY Hey, you, what's up? $ENTITY You look exactly like Santa! That's fantastic! $ENTITY If people started getting presents from someone like you, I bet that would make them really happy! $ENTITY .... Hey, I've got an idea! $ENTITY Instead of me, the usual holiday gift giver, why don't YOU $ENTITY deliver the presents to everyone tonight, kid? $ENTITY Leave it to me! I can't do it.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Ho?! $ENTITY Hey, you, what's up? $ENTITY You look exactly like Santa, kid! This is great! $ENTITY Your shoes are kind of different, but... Oh well. $ENTITY I guess normal people wouldn't even notice!... If people could get their presents from someone dressed like Santa, it'd make them so happy! $ENTITY .... Hey, I've got an idea! $ENTITY Instead of me, the holiday reindeer, why don't YOU $ENTITY deliver the presents to everyone around town? $ENTITY Leave it to me! I can't do it.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Oh, hey, you... Uh, $ENTITY why'd you stop pretending $ENTITY to be 100 percent jolly? $ENTITY I was hoping you'd deliver presents while wearing the full suit, kid. This makes me a sad little reindeer... .
NPC Jingle $ENTITY If you could deliver the presents while in that jolly red suit, I bet it would make everyone really happy... . $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Will you please help make everyone happy, kid? $ENTITY Sure! I can't do that.
NPC Jingle Hiya! $ENTITY How have you been since we last talked? $ENTITY Did you get your item problem all sorted out, kid? $ENTITY Yes, indeed! No, not yet.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hm... . This is such a perfect role for you... What a shame. That makes me a disappointed little reindeer.
NPC Jingle I see. $ENTITY Well then, just let me know when you're ready.
NPC Jingle ... Oh? $ENTITY It looks like you're still carrying too many items, kid. $ENTITY You need to have at least one item slot open so that I can give you the presents bag. Come back later!
NPC Jingle Good. It seems you're ready, kid.... Please take special care of these!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Ah! Hey! $ENTITY Why did you change your clothes? You know, the festive suit? You gotta wear the whole thing! This is a real job here, so you need to take it seriously... That makes me an annoyed little reindeer...
NPC Jingle Please finish delivering all presents by the time dawn breaks, and then bring the bag back to me! $ENTITY OK, I'm counting on you! Ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hiya, kid! $ENTITY So how's the task going? $ENTITY I'm done! I need a break.
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Yeah, you HAVE been working hard!... But please make sure you're acting festive during work, OK?
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Yeah, you've been working hard! $ENTITY Please do your best to get the job done before dawn comes around!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Please make sure to stay focused... You need to make the right choices and pass out the correct presents!
NPC Jingle After you deliver everyone's gifts, please bring the bag back to me! $ENTITY I have a pretty special present saved for you, so I'll give it to you when you're all done, kid! Ho ho!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Let's see... Ho?!... It looks like you still have some presents left, kid! $ENTITY There are just enough presents for each and every town resident, so come back when the bag is empty.
NPC Jingle ... Also, when you're delivering the presents, please make sure you're dressed up like Santa! Ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Let's see... Yup, yup!... You've indeed delivered everything perfectly, kid! $ENTITY Also, $ENTITY I can feel $ENTITY is just brimming with happiness at this exact moment! Oh joy! $ENTITY I bet $ENTITY this is all because you went out and made sure everyone's holiday wishes came true!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Let's see... Yup, Yup!... You've indeed delivered presents to everyone, kid! $ENTITY I mean, I probably would have been more careful to give the right gifts to the right people, but oh well. $ENTITY I'm sure it was a really tough job... Well, thank you for all your help!
NPC Jingle Hooray!... Now it's finally YOUR turn to receive a present! $ENTITY That's a nice change after helping so much! $ENTITY Since you did such a holly-jolly job, I'll give you a special little present. $ENTITY It's a $ENTITY festive wreath $ENTITY !
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Thanks to you, I'm sure tonight was a very wonderful and jingly night for everyone in town! Yeah! $ENTITY Mmm. Seeing smiles on every face in town makes me the happiest little reindeer in the world! $ENTITY Well, my work still isn't over, so I've got to go. $ENTITY See you! And ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle Ho! Really? $ENTITY I want to give you a present, but your pockets are full! Make some room, and then come see me again!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY You really did a great service today! $ENTITY I can't thank you enough, kid!
NPC Jingle Enjoy the rest of this wintry eve!... And have a happy ho ho ho-liday!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Don't worry. I'll be sure to return to $ENTITY next year to bring love and happiness to all! $ENTITY It would be nice if I could see you again next holiday season!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Seeing such joy here in $ENTITY was ever so nice. I'm just such a happy little festive reindeer! $ENTITY The smiles that greet me wherever I go are all the presents I ever need!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Oh, right!... Since you're here, can I ask you a favor, kid? $ENTITY When you talk to me, would you mind standing on my left? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY there's no particular reason for the request... $ENTITY I look the best from that angle.... Ho ho ho! $ENTITY 
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Hi there. Great look! $ENTITY It seems like you're quite the festive little soul!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Oh, hi there. Nice getup! $ENTITY I think you look just like someone I know!... . $ENTITY But, well, the shoes look different. $ENTITY You may be able to fool the others, $ENTITY but I certainly know better!... Ho ho!
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Oh, hi there. Nice look! $ENTITY Why, you look just like Santa in that outfit! $ENTITY I'd love it ever so much if you acted like you're really him and spread joy to everyone tonight!... Ho ho ho! $ENTITY 
NPC Jingle $ENTITY Oh no, $ENTITY I've stayed too long. $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY is well over. $ENTITY I'd best be heading off now!... See you again next holiday season!
