GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, I did it again.... I stayed up all night fussing over what I was going to wear today, $ENTITY . $ENTITY But I overthought it! I bet I look like a total mess, ... At least YOU look great! That gives me the guts to get up tomorrow and try again, $ENTITY .
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I think if you want to have a great day, $ENTITY just ask for one and $ENTITY you'll totally get it, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Here goes, ... Hey, world!... Gimme a great day! $ENTITY 
GE FreeA Always Aw, I have so much to do today, ... Why aren't there two of me? Then I could eat $ENTITY while doing $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I'm thinking about cooking up some fusion food. I love to see if crazy concoctions work, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Would $ENTITY and some $ENTITY mix well? $ENTITY If it turns out awful, I can always feed it to $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Was it just me, or did you totally smell $ENTITY in the air today, $ENTITY ! I bet it was just me. I have, like, a really amazing sense of smell. $ENTITY And I can smell $ENTITY a mile away!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I saw some really amazing clouds today, $ENTITY . They looked like some fluffy pile of dessert! $ENTITY In fact, they looked like cotton balls mixed with ... But there were other colors in there too, like ... I'm getting a stomachache just thinking about it, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Ever have a problem falling asleep at night, ... You know how some people count sheep jumping over a fence?... That doesn't work for me. $ENTITY So I've been counting ants jumping over ... But then the ants get stuck in all that sugary goodness until it's just a gooey pile of insects! $ENTITY And then I totally can't get to sleep! $ENTITY You can't imagine how awful the sight of that is, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Are you one of those people who gets super busy once it gets late, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I know I am! I totally start thinking about what I'm going to wear tomorrow, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY When the town gets quiet at night, $ENTITY I start hearing music in my head, $ENTITY ! I can't help it! I just LIVE for music.... What's in my head right now? Wait. Let me listen.... Hey! It's $ENTITY I just love that, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I really, $ENTITY really, $ENTITY REALLY need to have a specific dream tonight, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I forgot to hang out with $ENTITY today, so I'm hoping I can make it up in my dreams! $ENTITY Or else I'll be in big trouble with $ENTITY for skipping out!

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Spring makes me all excited! It's like getting an extra-huge slice of pie, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY For some reason, spring makes my heart race! It's like just before you open a present, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I just LOVE springtime, don't you? $ENTITY It's, like, $ENTITY out with the old $ENTITY and in with the new, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Summer is SO hot that it just drains the energy right out of me, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Times like this, you need a scary story to send chills down your spine. $ENTITY Something like.... remember the $ENTITY you left in the refrigerator? $ENTITY It's totally MOLDY!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Summertime is so hot, $ENTITY hot, $ENTITY hot! $ENTITY I can't take it anymore! $ENTITY At times like this, $ENTITY you need a ghost story to send chills down your spine, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Something like.... you know that cup of $ENTITY you left out?... A ghost drank it! $ENTITY Yeah.... I guess that's not very scary, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Today is ridiculously hot, so I thought up a scary story to give me the chills, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Ready for it? $ENTITY I went to the store and bought vanilla ice cream, and when I got home.... ? $ENTITY It wasn't vanilla! And it wasn't ice cream! It was a frozen dinner! Yeah, frozen $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So.... how'd you like the story?... I guess it wasn't very scary. $ENTITY But it WAS all freezy, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Fall really makes me all sentimental and stuff, ... I start appreciating my neighbors a whole lot more. Even the ones I don't like. $ENTITY And I think: $ENTITY what if you all just move away? I mean, what if $ENTITY or $ENTITY leave? $ENTITY I need friends and frenemies to stay happy! $ENTITY Please don't YOU ever move away, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Fall makes me a little sad around the edges, $ENTITY . I know! Me?! A little sad? Can't happen! But it does.... Still, being sad makes me slow down and think about all the things that make me HAPPY! $ENTITY Like how pretty the leaves are in the fall.... and seeing YOU all the time, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always Fall makes me totally sentimental. You know.... about pie. $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY pie! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY That's not being sentimental. $ENTITY I'm just HUNGRY, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY On cold days like this, I like thinking about hot stuff.... Oh! Like taking a bubble bath while reading a really good book, $ENTITY like $ENTITY ! But I always drop my books in the bath, $ENTITY and then the pages get all soaky! I'd better not do that!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY On cold days, I think about the warmest stuff I can, ... So here goes. $ENTITY Hey, I remember the first time WE ever met! I was so happy to meet a new neighbor.... Wow, that warmed me right up!... I'm glad you're around. You're like a cup of hot chocolate, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY On cold days, I try to visualize that it's summer, ... That way I can stay warm! $ENTITY OK, here I go.... Oh, wow.

GE FreeA Always ... 
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY People say I'm not a good loser. $ENTITY Well, why should I be, $ENTITY ? For instance.... I entered $ENTITY - eating contest with $ENTITY , and I totally didn't win! $ENTITY And I got a really bad stomachache! $ENTITY So $ENTITY I $ENTITY don't $ENTITY take $ENTITY losing $ENTITY well,... !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY People say I'm not a good winner. $ENTITY Well, why should I be, $ENTITY ? For example.... I won $ENTITY in a style contest. $ENTITY thought it was a dumb prize! It made me sad! $ENTITY So now I always shout "I WON! $ENTITY I WON!" to drown out anyone who says anything bad!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY People say I'm too competitive! $ENTITY Well, what's so bad about that, $ENTITY ? Like, $ENTITY and I were both going into a store the other day at the same time. $ENTITY One of us HAD to go in first, right? $ENTITY So what else could I do? I shoved my way in, $ENTITY ! And no one even THANKED me for breaking up that traffic jam. It's so hard being number one!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Everyone knows I can't stand losing. You've heard that too, right, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well, I was in a big competition recently.... competition! $ENTITY And I lost! $ENTITY Now I can't even THINK about doing that ever again! Ugh, why do I even bother competing, $ENTITY ?!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY I bet you've heard I can't stand losing, right? Well, I figured out how to stop losing. It's easy! $ENTITY I only compete in things that I know I'll win, like a singing contest or a cutest- $ENTITY competition!
GE FreeA Always I'm a big fan of fairy tales, $ENTITY but I always forget the endings! $ENTITY Can you help me remember one? $ENTITY 
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY So when that fairy-tale princess ran from the ball at midnight, what did she leave behind?... #x0; Glass slipper. Glass flipper. Glass skipper.
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A glass slipper? $ENTITY Are you sure about that? $ENTITY Well, I bet you're right, ... But I would so NOT want to be in that girl's shoes. Glass slippers sound WAY painful, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A glass flipper? $ENTITY That doesn't sound familiar. $ENTITY Well, I bet you're right, ... So the princess must have been some sort of fish then, right? $ENTITY I would love to go to a ballroom for dancing fish! $ENTITY Though that does sound more like a swimming pool.... 
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A glass skipper? $ENTITY That doesn't sound familiar. $ENTITY But I bet you're right, ... So was the princess actually a sailor? $ENTITY And she left her skipper behind? $ENTITY Who steered the boat? $ENTITY Well, if she crashed that boat on an island, it sorta serves her right! $ENTITY You never abandon your captain!
GE FreeA Always So what did that nasty, evil witch give to the beautiful princess?... #x0; $ENTITY Poison apple. Poison saddle. Poison rattle.
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A poison apple? $ENTITY Are you sure about that? $ENTITY Well, I bet you're right, ... Then she got to take a long nap, $ENTITY but some random prince woke her up with a kiss? EW!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A poison saddle? $ENTITY That doesn't sound familiar. $ENTITY Well, I bet you're right, ... So the princess was actually a cowboy or something? Or a rodeo queen? Then how'd she ever wake up again? Did her prince lasso her?... Wow, what a weird fairy tale!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm.... A poison rattle? $ENTITY That doesn't sound familiar. $ENTITY Well, I bet you're right, ... But what would a princess do with a poison rattle? That $ENTITY just sounds weird. $ENTITY Wouldn't it be easier to just slip her a poison sippy cup or something, $ENTITY ?
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY

I saw $ENTITY drop ... That seemed $ENTITY pret $ENTITY ty $ENTITY sus $ENTITY pic $ENTITY ious! $ENTITY I'm going to keep a close eye on our sneaky neighbor, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Oooh, really? Reality shows? I think our lives here would make a good reality show, don't you? $ENTITY Of course, you and I would be total stars and everyone else would end up looking like villains. Then again, even reality shows need good villains. $ENTITY Hey, can we be the bad guys, $ENTITY ?
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, neat! You know, you and I would be a GREAT team for one of those shows, $ENTITY ! You could sing.... and I could be your backup dancer! $ENTITY I've got all the right moves, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Game shows? I love those too! And you know what? I want to BE on one of those trivia shows! $ENTITY Because, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY I have an IQ of a hundred billion or something! There's not even a number for it! And you know what I'd do with my winnings, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I'd buy all the $ENTITY in the world. $ENTITY Wait! No! $ENTITY I'm not supersmart, now that I think about it. $ENTITY I just have a super-sweet tooth, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always D $ENTITY

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Recently I thought I'd try out some crazy makeup techniques. $ENTITY You know, just for fun? $ENTITY I tried to use a black marker to do my eyebrows.... and I totally gave myself a unibrow by accident! $ENTITY That is SO not a look I'm into. $ENTITY If I was a cyclops? Sure, whatever, $ENTITY . $ENTITY So no more black-marker makeup experiments for me, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Recently I thought I'd try out some crazy makeup techniques. $ENTITY You know, just for fun? $ENTITY I tried to use more blush than usual. $ENTITY But then when $ENTITY laughed at how I looked.... ? $ENTITY I blushed!

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Recently I thought I'd try out some crazy makeup techniques. $ENTITY You know, just for fun? $ENTITY I wanted to have totally dramatic eyes, $ENTITY . So I came up with an AMAZING idea! $ENTITY I drew the perfect eyes on top of my eyelids. $ENTITY Everyone said my eyes were STUNNING. But I had to keep my eyes closed all the time, so I kept walking into trees, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'm going to keep my real eyes wide open from now on, even if they're not nearly as pretty.
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Recently I thought I'd try out some crazy makeup techniques. $ENTITY You know, just for fun? $ENTITY I thought I'd try the new facial mask that's made of mud and $ENTITY ! But then $ENTITY came over and thought my face was dessert. We were BOTH so confused! $ENTITY I know I'm sweet, ... but that's just going too far. $ENTITY No more facial masks for me!

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah, every summer, I look at all my friends like they're shells on a beach! $ENTITY Then I think, are any like sharp coral that will hurt my feet if I step on them, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Because I throw those back out into the water! I only like friends who smile wide.... like clamshells!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah, every fall, I look at all my friends like they're leaves blowing around town, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Then I think, are they bringing lots of color into my life, or are they all blah and crinkly? $ENTITY Because then I rake my blah friends into a pile.... and then jump into it! $ENTITY Yeah, it REALLY wakes them up!
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah, every winter, I look at all my friends like they're icicles hanging on my house, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Then I think, are they hanging out because they like being around me? $ENTITY Or just because they're stuck? $ENTITY Then I knock down the ones that are stuck and give them a big hug! $ENTITY It melts them real fast!

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY mn
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY They can't just sing and dance! $ENTITY People look up to pop stars! $ENTITY So they have to use their influence.

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY They can't just sing and dance! $ENTITY People admire pop stars, right? $ENTITY They have to use their influence!

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY They can't just sing and dance. $ENTITY People look up to pop stars. $ENTITY They have a responsibility! I think they should encourage people to waste less energy! $ENTITY Yeah, I'll be the first one to do it! $ENTITY I'll sing and dance while barely moving at all. $ENTITY I'll be a low-wattage star.... and $ENTITY barely shine at all, $ENTITY .
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY They can't just sing and dance! $ENTITY People idolize pop stars, so they should use their influence for good! $ENTITY I think they should try to encourage folks to be nice to the environment! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY plant trees and stuff! $ENTITY You know, the more trees there are, the more oxygen there'll be. And a good singer needs oxygen! $ENTITY Just try holding your breath and singing at the same time. It's, like, totally impossible, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY You haven't? $ENTITY Wow, that's all I ever think about, $ENTITY . Well, never mind then, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY

GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Really? Me too! $ENTITY I just hope I wouldn't get SO excited that I'd forget my parachute, $ENTITY !
GE FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh yeah? I'd love to do that too! $ENTITY Why should lumberjacks have all the fun, $ENTITY ?

Allegedly. $ENTITY If you see a hat or something in $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY 's shop for $ENTITY #x0;1,031 Bells... you should probably snatch it up!
