BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY "
BO FreeG Visitor I'm curious:... Is the town you're from far away? $ENTITY Like, how long would it take to run there?... Five minutes. Thirty minutes. One hour. Twelve hours.
BO FreeG Visitor Just between you and me,... how does $ENTITY compare to your town? $ENTITY It's cleaner. It's dirtier. It's exquisite! It's smaller. They're the same.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY This is just between you and me, $ENTITY but what do you think of the mayor of this town? $ENTITY Kind! Funny! Scary... Cute. Cool.
BO FreeG Visitor Get ready, 'cause it's time for... Dr. $ENTITY 's $ENTITY health screening!... how are you feeling? $ENTITY I'm at 100% I'm at 0%
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY So what's popular in your town right now? $ENTITY Hide-and-seek. Bug catching. Fishing. Bread-eating contests. Fashion shows.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY A 5-minute run? $ENTITY That's pretty close.... But it'd probably be a half-hour crawl, right? So I guess that's actually pretty far,... .
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY A 30-minute run sounds like a good workout,... But I'm not really the working-out type. $ENTITY I'm more the power-napping type, you know?
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY It took you a whole hour to run here?!... Sounds rough! $ENTITY You should recharge with a local specialty,... - soaked $ENTITY ! .... What's that? $ENTITY You came on the train?... Yeah, $ENTITY taking the train is more my speed too.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Whaaaaat?! $ENTITY You ran for 12 hours?! $ENTITY How are you even standing? $ENTITY If I were you, $ENTITY I'd be out like a light!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, really! $ENTITY So $ENTITY is a pretty clean place, huh,... I don't travel very much, $ENTITY so I don't have much to compare my town to.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I can't believe you think our town is dirty. $ENTITY But now that you mention it, I guess it is... .
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I've never heard $ENTITY called " $ENTITY exquisite" before. $ENTITY Though to be honest, $ENTITY I can't say I totally get $ENTITY what exactly you mean by that... Even so, $ENTITY it would be pretty cool if people started calling me Exquisite ... .
BO FreeG Visitor It might be smaller,... but you know, $ENTITY I really like the small-town feel!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY If that's the case,... I guess I'd have no problem living there!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Good for you for staying in shape!... You should spread that positive attitude! Make sure you talk $ENTITY with everyone in town,... .
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, so you're feeling about normal? $ENTITY Well, that's nothing to sneeze at! $ENTITY If you're too energetic and you overdo it,... you might end up getting sick. $ENTITY So you gotta be careful!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY You're not doing so well, huh? $ENTITY What happened?!... Hmmm... Are you sure you're eating properly? $ENTITY Make sure you eat $ENTITY three square meals a day. $ENTITY Plus snacks,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY That bad?! $ENTITY It must be because we don't live in the same town. $ENTITY If you could just see me any old time, $ENTITY I bet you'd be right as rain... All right! $ENTITY Then it's decided! $ENTITY I'm gonna be a big TV star someday. $ENTITY Then you can see my smiling mug all the time,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I totally agree! $ENTITY Having a kind mayor just makes life in $ENTITY so much better,... .
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I totally agree! $ENTITY Yep, our mayor could probably have an alternate career as a stand-up comedian!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Scary?! $ENTITY But the mayor's always been nice to me. $ENTITY Sometimes when people are hard on you, $ENTITY it's just their way of showing they care.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY You think the mayor's cute?!... I never thought that before, $ENTITY but I guess you've got a point.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I totally agree with you! $ENTITY I wish I could be even half as cool as the mayor,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY So hide-and-seek is all the rage in your town, huh?... Wait. $ENTITY Are you in the middle of a match right now? $ENTITY Hiding in another town is a great strategy,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY So that must mean $ENTITY you came here today to catch some bugs!... I hope you snag a rare one,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I guess fishing is popular everywhere!... I'm a big fisher too. $ENTITY I wonder if the fish that get away from me $ENTITY end up swimming to your town.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY Bread-eating contests?!... We didn't have any of that $ENTITY back when I lived there! Man! $ENTITY That's just not fair,... !
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Uh huh huh... You think I $ENTITY would make a good model? $ENTITY I'd be all like, $ENTITY " $ENTITY Stop! $ENTITY Strike $ENTITY a pose!"
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Have you been using the lockers at the station,... The stuff you put in those lockers gets sent to $ENTITY the lockers in your town $ENTITY or the closets in your house! $ENTITY Hmmm... I don't really get exactly $ENTITY how they work, but... they're super convenient, $ENTITY so you should use 'em! $ENTITY 
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY 
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY You're the mayor $ENTITY in your new town, right, ... Someday I'm gonna get out of here $ENTITY and become mayor of $ENTITY Town. $ENTITY My first ordinance will be $ENTITY to have $ENTITY party every week,... !
BO FreeG Visitor Hey, let me ask you something! $ENTITY What kind of place... is ... #x0; It's cool! It's cute! It's sophisticated! It's dangerous!
BO FreeG Visitor Well, that makes perfect sense.... With you as mayor, of course your town is cool. $ENTITY A huh huh huh! $ENTITY I'd love to come visit sometime, $ENTITY .
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Then it perfectly matches you, ... A huh huh huh!
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I'd love to visit sometime.... A huh huh... But only if I don't stick out too much.
BO FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, I'm sure you're overreacting. $ENTITY A little bit of danger can be very exciting, ...
