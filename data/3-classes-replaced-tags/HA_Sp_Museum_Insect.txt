HA Sp Museum_Insect This isn't just a botanical garden! $ENTITY If more bugs are donated to us, $ENTITY it can be a paradise for the bugs! $ENTITY But for the time being it's just a minor stop on my jogging route! Ha ha! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY I came all the way here, but I don't see a lot of bugs around... This is pretty much the same as being... anywhere outside! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Wow! Look at all these bugs! Very impressive! $ENTITY If all of them decided to attack me at once, I'd have no other choice but to surrender right away!

HA Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Bugs seem so small, but they're quite powerful! $ENTITY I'm sure they wouldn't be able to lift me off the ground, though!... Right?... They couldn't, right?!
