ZK FreeF Cleaning Today is the annual $ENTITY Weeding Day $ENTITY in our town, isn't it,... I should help by... showing off my dance moves! $ENTITY It'll help get everyone excited to clean! Hah ha!
ZK FreeF Cleaning Weeds are pretty sad, huh? $ENTITY I'm sure they have real names, $ENTITY but we don't even know what they are... And what's worse, $ENTITY people just hate them and tear them up... Yet $ENTITY they keep coming back! $ENTITY In a way, $ENTITY they deserve some respect! $ENTITY Not much, but some.... .
ZK FreeF Cleaning What's really sad is that everyone assumes someone else will clean up the town. $ENTITY I think it's important to have the initiative to clean all the time! $ENTITY I'm talking about you, of course. $ENTITY I'm too busy to do any cleaning myself. $ENTITY I mean, where would I find time?
ZK FreeF Cleaning $ENTITY Today is the day specifically set aside to clean the town and pull weeds, right? I'd get excited about cleaning, $ENTITY but that is soooo last week's trend. $ENTITY I have to stay ahead of the newest fads, you know?
ZK FreeF Cleaning $ENTITY I wonder if they pulled all the weeds outside.... I'm staying insid $ENTITY so I'm not in the way of anybody.... Heh. No, of COURSE I'm not just avoiding work! Who told you that?
ZK FreeF Cleaning $ENTITY I'm tidying up all my stuff here,... So... can you take care of the weeding outside? $ENTITY Thanks!
