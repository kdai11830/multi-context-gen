ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY The best way to spend $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is to just grab some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and stay at home relaxing!
ZK Ev HalloweenB During $ENTITY Halloween... you'll basically see two types of people out there,... . $ENTITY People who buy lots of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and stay at home... And people who try to swipe $ENTITY candy $ENTITY from others by scaring them. $ENTITY I don't really like scaring people... So I'd rather be the former type!... Hah ha! $ENTITY Am I exaggerating things?
ZK Ev HalloweenB If you're trying to be real spooky on $ENTITY Halloween... you gotta wear a weird mask, you know?... . $ENTITY That's just another reason why I'd rather stay home doing nothing. It fits me better... 
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I love $ENTITY candy... #x2;candy... Heh. Talking like this sort of makes me sound like a little kid again,... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB I bought a TON of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY exclusively $ENTITY for this day,... ! $ENTITY I'm ready for whatever may come my way!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You should be more careful today! $ENTITY Everyone is trying to get that $ENTITY candy $ENTITY of yours,... ! $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY #x2;Halloween $ENTITY today, right?... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Everyone is scared of ghosts and things like that, $ENTITY but not me! No, sir, I'm not scared of anything! $ENTITY It's so nice being utterly fearless. Uh, $ENTITY just don't go asking around about that fact, though... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Everyone seems to be so scared of monsters and things like that, $ENTITY but I'm not scared,... . They may look all mean, $ENTITY but people frequently misunderstand them. $ENTITY They're just a little clumsy is all... 
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I used to be afraid of big bugs, $ENTITY but... I've recently overcome that fear! $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY if I found some girls who were terrified of bugs... I'd have a chance to look really brave!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Everyone seems to be so scared of werewolves, $ENTITY but I'm not scared of them one bit,... . $ENTITY I mean, besides,... I sat next to a wolf in junior high anyway... 
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Everyone seems to be so scared of mummies, $ENTITY but I'm not scared. Not even a little bit,... . He's covered in bandages, $ENTITY so really we should be nice to him... I mean, he's just hurt, right?
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Everyone seems to be so scared of $ENTITY skeletons, $ENTITY but they don't scare me,... . $ENTITY If anything, $ENTITY I think I sort of admire their dedication! $ENTITY If you really think about it, keeping that many bones together while dancing? $ENTITY That takes skill!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey, that's not what you promised! $ENTITY I already gave you some $ENTITY candy... so please go away!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You promised, didn't you? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY If I gave you some $ENTITY candy... you were supposed to leave me alone... 
ZK Ev HalloweenB You don't belong here anymore! $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY but can you leave now?... ?
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Don't sell me short. $ENTITY I can't be scared by a silly mask like that. $ENTITY Hee hee hee... Were you trying to get at my $ENTITY candy... In that case, $ENTITY battle me for it! $ENTITY If you win, $ENTITY I'll let you have some $ENTITY candy... But $ENTITY if I win,... I'll get to play a trick on you! $ENTITY And don't think I lack the ability! $ENTITY All us animals have magic...
ZK Ev HalloweenB .... What are you playing at?... Something like that won't scare me that much, you know. $ENTITY I suppose I should be playing some kind of prank on you, but I'll give you a second chance at $ENTITY candy $ENTITY . $ENTITY If you play a game with me and win, $ENTITY I'll let you have some $ENTITY candy... However, if I win, I won't hesitate $ENTITY to have a little fun at your expense.
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You think I was just gonna be a target for your little pranks?... Ha!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Heh heh heh! $ENTITY Did I scare you?... You know what they say: a skilled $ENTITY always hides his talons. $ENTITY Wait.... That's not what they say?!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY ?!... W-wait... Hold on! $ENTITY I'll give this to you, $ENTITY so could you just go away, please?
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Huh $ENTITY ?!... ?! $ENTITY I-I... I'll give this to you, $ENTITY so please, just go away!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY ?!... wait, please! $ENTITY I'll give this to you, so won't you please just leave?... Oh no, $ENTITY looks like you're carrying so much that you can't take it! I'm doomed!... !
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY There, I gave you some $ENTITY candy... Now can't you just leave me be?!... ?!
ZK Ev HalloweenB There! Now you have nothing to complain about, right?
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I know they're just masks, $ENTITY but still... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I suppose no matter how old I get,... I'll always be afraid of some things in this world... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB Oh boy... I'll give you some $ENTITY candy... so can you get out of here, please?
ZK Ev HalloweenB What a pain... I'll give this to you, so $ENTITY please leave right away.... Huh. Wait? $ENTITY You're still carrying a ton of stuff, aren't you? $ENTITY Heh heh... You look all scary, but you're actually pretty harmless, aren't you?
ZK Ev HalloweenB ... Huh? $ENTITY Weird. $ENTITY It wasn't supposed to go like that... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey, ... Happy Halloween! $ENTITY Trick or treat! Let's just chat.
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Happy Halloween, ... Trick or treat! I just came to chat.
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Sorry, ... but I'm not giving you my $ENTITY candy... I have this $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ready just in case that THING comes by... .
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hah ha!... You can't expect any $ENTITY candy $ENTITY dressed like that! $ENTITY You gotta scare me with some kinda scary hat or mask or something!
ZK Ev HalloweenB I already played a game with you... Please, you've gotta leave already,... !
ZK Ev HalloweenB You're $ENTITY pretty stubborn, huh,... I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not going to be scared. Nope!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Then let's play a game of... rock-paper-scissors... #x0;
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Then let's play... charades... #x0;
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Then let's play... Made Ya Look... #x0;
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY not going to hold back... Take this! $ENTITY 
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I feel a bit bad, but $ENTITY a promise is a promise, right?... You'll just have to grin and bear it! $ENTITY 
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY A promise is a promise! $ENTITY I'd better give you this $ENTITY candy $ENTITY !
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY That's strange. $ENTITY I didn't think it would go this way, but... I did make a promise, so I'll give this $ENTITY candy $ENTITY to you,... !
ZK Ev HalloweenB .... Hey, wait! $ENTITY Your pockets are super full already, aren't they? $ENTITY That means $ENTITY I can't give you any $ENTITY candy... Tough luck. $ENTITY We'll just have to forget we even played the game!
ZK Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Starting today, $ENTITY that $ENTITY candy $ENTITY belongs to you... Cherish it always!
ZK Ev HalloweenB I couldn't protect $ENTITY my precious $ENTITY candy... I'll do better next time.
