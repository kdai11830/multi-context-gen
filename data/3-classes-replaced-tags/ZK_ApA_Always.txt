ZK ApA Always I'm trying to decide what kind of flowers I like most. $ENTITY Red? $ENTITY Yellow? $ENTITY Maybe somewhere in between? $ENTITY You know me, $ENTITY . $ENTITY If you had to guess my fave, what would it be? $ENTITY Red Yellow
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Red as red gets, $ENTITY ?!... Hmm. $ENTITY What does THAT say about me, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY 
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Just sort of red, ... Well, $ENTITY I wonder what that means about me, $ENTITY .
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Orange?... Hmm. $ENTITY That's interesting, ... But there are different kinds of orange, you know. $ENTITY 
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Around the yellow end of the spectrum, ... I didn't see THAT coming, ... 
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY So you must think I'm some sort of mad bull or something! $ENTITY But I swear I'm not. $ENTITY I'M NOT! $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY that settles it, $ENTITY . $ENTITY No red flowers for me.
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY The color of love, is it? $ENTITY OK, I'll admit it. $ENTITY I'm a romantic soul under all this 'tude, $ENTITY . $ENTITY So $ENTITY red it is, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Thanks for helping me figure that out.
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY What, $ENTITY you think I can't handle red to the extreme? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY do you? $ENTITY I'm as extreme as the next guy! $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY that settles it, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I think I've got issues at the red end of the spectrum, $ENTITY .
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY I see myself as more passionate than that. $ENTITY But if that's how YOU see me, $ENTITY ... $ENTITY Well, I trust you. I guess I should express myself with more gusto, less cool. $ENTITY Thanks for being honest.
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Tangerine, for instance. $ENTITY 
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Like salmon. No, really. $ENTITY That's sort of an orange. $ENTITY I think? $ENTITY Maybe it's closer to yellow. $ENTITY I guess salmon is a slippery sort of color. $ENTITY But I'm pretty hard to pin down too, $ENTITY !
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Pumpkin, for example. $ENTITY Hmm. Why are so many orange colors named after food? $ENTITY Maybe orange really is very me. I do enjoy a good snack. $ENTITY I guess you had me figured out, $ENTITY !
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY But what kind of yellow...? Canary yellow?... Wait $ENTITY what?! Do you think I'm flighty? Sorry. $ENTITY I'm jumping to conclusions. I didn't mean anything by it, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I just get a little crazy when it comes to finding my place on the color wheel, $ENTITY .
ZK ApA Always But there are so many kinds of yellow, $ENTITY . Which one is specifically ME? $ENTITY Maybe a sort of banana yellow...? Yeah, I feel like I'm going bananas half of the time, $ENTITY . The other half of the time, $ENTITY I'm cool as a cucumber. $ENTITY Man, how mixed up am I, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Hey, wait!... That makes me a banana-cucumber smoothie!... Yeah, there's no one like me!
ZK ApA Always So could I get some advice from you, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY

ZK ApA Always $ENTITY So $ENTITY do I cut it? $ENTITY I'd like to think I'm fashion forward. $ENTITY Unless you think I'm fashion backward... $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY if I was so backward that I was a fashion dinosaur, $ENTITY you'd tell me, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY RRRoWRR! Fash $ENTITY ion $ENTITY ram $ENTITY page! Wait, wait. $ENTITY I'm OK.... Wow, you really know how to push my buttons, $ENTITY .

ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY by little things... do you mean microscopic?... Ack! $ENTITY Am I crawling with germs?! $ENTITY Get them off! Get them OFF! Get them $ENTITY Gross. $ENTITY Now they're on you. $ENTITY Sorry about that, $ENTITY .
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY I mean, if our friends didn't say what was wrong with us, $ENTITY it would be... ... CHAOS! $ENTITY What if I went out with my shoes on the wrong feet? I would just walk in circles $ENTITY all $ENTITY day $ENTITY long! $ENTITY So, $ENTITY , do me a favor? $ENTITY Obsess about my footwear as much as I do, $ENTITY OK? $ENTITY Thanks!
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY What I'm saying is, if friends didn't point out our every flaw, $ENTITY it would be... ... INSANITY! $ENTITY What if I'm wearing the same thing as the next guy? What if?! We'd look exactly alike! $ENTITY So, ... the next time you see two of me walking around? $ENTITY Tell one of us to stop it. $ENTITY Thanks!

ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY Good to know. $ENTITY Thought I'd lost it, $ENTITY !
ZK ApA Always $ENTITY Clueless?... It's cool, right? $ENTITY 
ZK ApA Always Yeah, I guess I am, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'd have to be pretty clueless to ASK if I'm clueless, $ENTITY .
ZK ApA Always Or is it that I'm... $ENTITY mysterious? Yeah, that's me. $ENTITY , $ENTITY the man of mystery... $ENTITY Just TRY to figure me out.... You can't!... Mwa ha ha!
ZK ApA Always Not sure, $ENTITY ? I guess that makes me cool as ... Yeah, I said it FIRST! Wait. I don't even know if that sounded awesome or not.... I'm so not cool, $ENTITY .
