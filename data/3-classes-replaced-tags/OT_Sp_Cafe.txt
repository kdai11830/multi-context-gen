OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Ahhh... sitting down with a freshly brewed cup of coffee is one of my favorite things. $ENTITY It's like time just stops so I can sit here and savor the moment.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Really good coffee is harder to find than you might think. $ENTITY We're lucky to have $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY here in $ENTITY .
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Sometimes it's best when a business sticks to its strengths. $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY is great at making coffee, $ENTITY and that's all he does. $ENTITY I think it's a refreshing attitude.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Some cafs try to draw you in with gimmicks, $ENTITY like free Internet... or dancing clowns. $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY like Tony's Dancing Clown Coffee ... Over in that other town? Anyway, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's only gimmick is making the best coffee around, $ENTITY and that's all he needs.
OT Sp Cafe ... Whoa! $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY The coffee just hit me. $ENTITY I am not a morning person.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I never thought I'd say this, $ENTITY but it would actually be nice if this place offered breakfast or lunch... 
OT Sp Cafe At this time of day, $ENTITY I kind of wish $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY sold something with a little less caffeine... like tea. $ENTITY Don't tell him I said that, OK? $ENTITY 
OT Sp Cafe ... is that really the time? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I've been here way too long. I can't help it sometimes. $ENTITY This place is just too cozy.
OT Sp Cafe Well, $ENTITY so much for sleeping tonight. $ENTITY I'm on the one-way express to insomnia-ville. $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY that means I've had too much coffee. $ENTITY !
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY My favorite type of coffee here is the ... lue Mountain $ENTITY roast. $ENTITY It makes me feel like I'm on top of the world.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY My favorite type of coffee here is the $ENTITY mocha $ENTITY roast. $ENTITY That rich, $ENTITY chocolaty aroma gets me every time.... 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY My favorite type of coffee here is the $ENTITY Kilimanjaro $ENTITY roast. $ENTITY It's so bold and exotic!... !
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY My favorite type of coffee here is the $ENTITY house blend... It's so smooth... It's like drinking silk.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I take my coffee with $ENTITY a lot of milk... I suppose some purists might say it's more like I put coffee in my milk than milk in my coffee!
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I'm very particular about how much milk is in my coffee. $ENTITY If it's not $ENTITY the regular amount... it's just not right.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I only put $ENTITY a little milk $ENTITY in my coffee. $ENTITY Because I want to actually taste the coffee, $ENTITY you know?
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I drink my coffee black. $ENTITY That means I $ENTITY don't put any milk $ENTITY in it. $ENTITY I just don't want to water down the incredible flavor of $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's delicious roasts. $ENTITY And no, $ENTITY I am not getting paid to say that.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always put $ENTITY 3 sugars $ENTITY in my coffee.... Otherwise I can hardly taste it!
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always put $ENTITY 2 sugars $ENTITY in my coffee. $ENTITY It creates just the right balance between bitter and sweet flavors. $ENTITY Mmmm,... !
OT Sp Cafe I always put $ENTITY 1 sugar $ENTITY in my coffee. $ENTITY It adds a little sweetness but doesn't overwhelm the rich character of the roast.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY I take my coffee $ENTITY without any sugar... It goes so much better with donuts that way!
OT Sp Cafe Hey,... do you know the difference between real coffee and a coffee drink? $ENTITY Real coffee, $ENTITY like the stuff $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY serves here, $ENTITY is simply made from roasted and ground coffee beans. $ENTITY A coffee drink could be anything. $ENTITY You never know what you're getting.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY , here's something I bet you didn't know. $ENTITY 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY #x0;#
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY You can use dried coffee grounds to clean the grease off of pots and pans. $ENTITY I haven't tried putting any in my bath yet, $ENTITY but I'm thinking about it... 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY They say that the aroma from a good cup of coffee can relieve stress all by itself! $ENTITY So the next time you're worried about something, $ENTITY just come down here and order a fresh cup. Position your nose right over the coffee, $ENTITY and... ahhhhhh! $ENTITY The stress just melts away.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Some people drink coffee because it helps them stay alert. $ENTITY But you have to be careful not to overdo it. Coffee can rev you up like a race car. $ENTITY And you know what happens when you rev a race car too fast!
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Everything is in bloom, and love is in the air! $ENTITY I'm speaking, $ENTITY of course, $ENTITY of my love for $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's fine coffee.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Maybe I should have ordered an iced coffee... 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY The leaves are falling, and the weather is getting colder. $ENTITY But this coffee still warms me to my soul.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY A hot coffee on a cold winter's day is pretty much the greatest thing of all time.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY My goal is simply to serve the best-tasting coffee in $ENTITY .
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY And that's what really matters.... Not how many menu items a place can cram onto its menu.
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Actually,... I was thinking about offering brunch
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Wait.... WHAT? $ENTITY Please tell me you're joking. $ENTITY Before you know it, $ENTITY this place will be overrun with brunch-munching maniacs and their kids! $ENTITY My highly caffeinated hideaway will be ruined. $ENTITY 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Or... not. $ENTITY It was just an idea... 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY But... I only know how to make coffee... 
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Ha! $ENTITY I know $ENTITY I was only joking. $ENTITY You seem tense... You should relax and have a cup yourself!
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY Yes. I serve only the finest house- roasted beans harvested from shade-grown
OT Sp Cafe $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY . $ENTITY We get it.
