ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY I kinda got caught by $ENTITY and... 
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY we're trying to act out a teen drama... But we don't have enough actors. $ENTITY You gotta help us! Can't you please participate or something?... ( Sure! Nope, sorry!
ZK 3P Ha Then I'll be the captain of the $ENTITY club... And $ENTITY belongs to the $ENTITY club,... so you're the manager of that group... 
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY #xE;Er, $ENTITY actually, $ENTITY is a boy, $ENTITY so he's one of the club members... it should be $ENTITY club instead of $ENTITY club... 
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Maybe a manager for the $ENTITY club instead... 
ZK 3P Ha ... I've got script issues to work out, $ENTITY so let's do this another time!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY , that's OK, isn't it? $ENTITY Maybe the next time you see ... he'll have forgotten all about this.... We can only hope!
ZK 3P Ha Oh, come on,... Don't be so antisocial... If it's just me and $ENTITY that's not enough people and we'll just give up... 
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY You saved me, ... Thanks to you, this might end up as just another one of $ENTITY 's ideas. $ENTITY Truth be told, $ENTITY I actually get sort of nervous when I have to act... 
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY You saved me, ... Now I might get away without having to go along with $ENTITY 's idea. $ENTITY But $ENTITY if it was your idea, $ENTITY I get the feeling it would have been a little better written.... Hah ha!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY #xE;Help me,... keeps telling me to show off my muscles and won't stop until I agree,... !
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Great timing! $ENTITY Why don't we get into a flexing contest? $ENTITY Biggest deltoids wins it all! ... Sure! No, thanks! No, you muscly nut!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY 
ZK 3P Ha ... maybe you're a crazy fitness nut too... ?
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY I didn't expect to have a rival here... , should we, uh, $ENTITY postpone this until later? $ENTITY Ahhhh! $ENTITY I guess I gotta start training EVEN HARDER!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY but you somehow saved me there,... Thanks!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY C'mon! You too,... ? Don't be so antisocial... Fine. $ENTITY I'll look for people who are a little more enthusiastic about the fine art of flexing,... .
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY You saved me there,... This may just end up as another one of $ENTITY 's silly ideas.... Besides, my muscles are a bit too powerful to be unleashed just yet... Don't worry. I'm kidding!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Do you really think I'm that muscly?... Ah, dude, thanks!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY For some odd reason, $ENTITY seems pretty happy... so I guess it worked out somehow?
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Hi, ... just asked me a question. $ENTITY The question is, $ENTITY "What do I wear when the activity I'm spending my time with is $ENTITY ?"
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY I wanna become a great legend of $ENTITY by moving so fast that people can't even see me! There's bound to be some sort of clothing that'll help me out!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY why don't you just play wearing a jet pack? $ENTITY You know, all futuristic!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY You mean, they HAVE those?... I never had that idea... It might actually work, though, right? $ENTITY It's a great idea! Don't do it!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY You think so, ... If that's the case, $ENTITY I gotta make sure I don't get lazy, so I gotta start training even HARDER!
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY Whatever the reason is... it seems you've set him on fire,... . $ENTITY Well... it's not a bad thing! $ENTITY I'm sure he'll become a legend soon enough in ... #x0; $ENTITY Hm. Well, he would if he could really purchase a jet pack, $ENTITY but at least he seems happy enough at the moment.
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY Uh, $ENTITY yeah, you're right, huh? $ENTITY I knew that,... If I did something like that, $ENTITY I'd break the rules and be kicked out of the game, right?... .
ZK 3P Ha $ENTITY I guess this is why I'll never understand sports! $ENTITY
