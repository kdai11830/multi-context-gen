HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY You dig with this shovel, and then you dig and dig and dig some more. $ENTITY You get so tired, but that's when $ENTITY tastes so great! $ENTITY And then you fill in the hole and fill it in some more. $ENTITY And you get so tired again, but that's when $ENTITY tastes great again, $ENTITY !
HA FreeB ItemN Old dudes at construction sites are the coolest, aren't they? $ENTITY The kind of manual labor they do... It makes my muscles tingle just thinking about it! $ENTITY So I'm kind of copying them and walking around with this shovel. Suits me, huh?
HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY Yeah! I'm going to catch some giant bugs with this thing! $ENTITY I wonder if I'll see any that are twice as big as you. $ENTITY Come to think of it, $ENTITY this net might not cut it! $ENTITY Oh, man! I need a bigger net! $ENTITY !
HA FreeB ItemN If you hold your net just like so, the bugs will fly right into it! $ENTITY Well, maybe not. But sometimes you get lucky! Haha! $ENTITY

HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY I'm going to run around town and water all the plants! $ENTITY I'm gonna grow 'em super big and turn this town into a gigantic jungle! ... What's with that suspicious smile?... Don't you wanna have some jungle adventures?
HA FreeB ItemN I think walking around in the rain is really cool. $ENTITY But I don't want to catch a cold! $ENTITY Do I look cool, or do I stay healthy?... I can't decide, $ENTITY !
HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY It might not look like it, but my umbrella weighs 200 pounds! $ENTITY Ha ha! I can do strength training even when it's raining! $ENTITY 
HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY Yesterday I was dancing to the rhythm of $ENTITY while eating $ENTITY . $ENTITY Do you think I accidentally created a rain dance? $ENTITY Is this rain my fault?
HA FreeB ItemN $ENTITY Rain is so dramatic. $ENTITY You can really show the world what you're made of by the way you act in the rain! $ENTITY I'm telling you, my blood is starting to stir, $ENTITY !
