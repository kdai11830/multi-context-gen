AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY So it's just me... 
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY why'd you start practicing all of a sudden anyway? $ENTITY Just get one of your boyfriends to do the smooshing. $ENTITY

AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Fine? I look fine? $ENTITY Oh, my! $ENTITY Ha ha ha! $ENTITY Well, I guess I was hoping for more than "fine" since I spend so much time on beauty... But thank you! $ENTITY Fine is better than some other things you could say. $ENTITY Still, if I can understand the secret to $ENTITY 's skin, mine can be so much better!
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY You know... now that you mention it, $ENTITY maybe that thing I tried the other day is working? $ENTITY The $ENTITY pack!

AN 3P Ot ... No problem, $ENTITY !
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Born that way? $ENTITY You think so?
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Come to think of it, everyone in my family has real strong skin! $ENTITY Even when we get super sunburned, it just bounces back right away!
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmm... I guess that means I'll have to investigate your family too now! $ENTITY Let me know the next time you're making a trip home, $ENTITY !
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Uh... .sure. $ENTITY .
AN 3P Ot $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY Well... I suppose so! $ENTITY That makes sense! $ENTITY Love really is the strongest beauty lotion!
