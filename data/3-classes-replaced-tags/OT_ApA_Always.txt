OT ApA Always $ENTITY So, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I've been thinking about your hairstyle. $ENTITY Oh, not this one. $ENTITY Your next one. It's never good to stick with the same style too long. $ENTITY How long do you think you'll go next time? $ENTITY I'm thinking short I'm thinking long
OT ApA Always $ENTITY Very short? Well, what a bold choice, ... I'm just trying to picture it. $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY I can't. No, really. $ENTITY I just CAN'T imagine it. $ENTITY Maybe if it's a little longer?... Oh, don't mind me. $ENTITY When it comes to hair, stay on the cutting edge!
OT ApA Always $ENTITY 
OT ApA Always
OT ApA Always $ENTITY 
OT ApA Always $ENTITY Very long? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY that sounds extreme,... How long are we talking? $ENTITY To your shoulders? $ENTITY Your waist?... No! $ENTITY You can't mean to the FLOOR! $ENTITY Who do you think you are, $ENTITY some $ENTITY #xC;... #x0;s in a tower, $ENTITY waiting to be rescued? $ENTITY Oh... $ENTITY #xE; You'd look GREAT with long hair,... . $ENTITY I'm just jealous.
OT ApA Always $ENTITY On the shorter side, $ENTITY ? Well, that's interesting. $ENTITY You must not like to fuss with your hair too much then?... Short IS more manageable. $ENTITY But is it more stylish? $ENTITY You know, on you, $ENTITY but ONLY you, $ENTITY I think it will look great, $ENTITY .
OT ApA Always $ENTITY So you want it short, $ENTITY ? Well, let me think. $ENTITY Short is simple, I guess. $ENTITY But is it right for you? I think you're pretty fabulous. $ENTITY Maybe you should consider being as fabulous on the outside. $ENTITY But if anyone can look like a million Bells with short hair, it's you, $ENTITY .
OT ApA Always $ENTITY So a medium length, $ENTITY ? Hmm. That could be nice. $ENTITY At that length, you could dabble in long hairdos or short dos. $ENTITY You like to keep your options open, don't you, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I like that. It's smart, $ENTITY !
OT ApA Always $ENTITY So medium, $ENTITY ? Sort of in between? $ENTITY Wait. Did you say that because you thought I'd be critical? $ENTITY Well, sometimes I am, $ENTITY I guess.... But I'm giving a thumbs-up to your hair all the time from now on!
OT ApA Always So you're going long, $ENTITY ? Well, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY well. $ENTITY Having lots of hair is a big responsibility. $ENTITY Like owning a pet that sits on your head. $ENTITY Are you ready to take your hair for a walk every day? And give it water? And shampoo it? Oh, it's LOTS of trouble. $ENTITY But if you still want long hair, $ENTITY please, $ENTITY keep it on a leash, $ENTITY .
OT ApA Always $ENTITY You said long hair,... ? Hmm. $ENTITY But won't so much hair get hot? $ENTITY I'm sweating just thinking about it! $ENTITY Why would anyone want so much hair on their head? $ENTITY Still, $ENTITY if anyone can be cool with THAT much hair, $ENTITY it's you,... .
OT ApA Always $ENTITY 
OT ApA Always $ENTITY There's a rumor that I've been gossiping about you, $ENTITY . Do you think it's true? $ENTITY Yeah, definitely. Of course not.
OT ApA Always $ENTITY Word is getting around that I've been talking about you behind your back, $ENTITY . Think it's true? $ENTITY Yes, of course. What? Not you!
OT ApA Always $ENTITY What?! Who told you? $ENTITY Well, never mind, ... I don't say bad things. $ENTITY How could I? You're clearly better than everyone around here. I'm just spreading the good word!
OT ApA Always $ENTITY What? You don't think so? Why, that's so nice of you, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'm going to tell EVERYONE you said that, $ENTITY !
OT ApA Always $ENTITY What?! Who told you? $ENTITY Well, never mind, ... I never say anything bad. $ENTITY How could I? You're so amazing. It's more like I $ENTITY you behind your back, $ENTITY .
OT ApA Always $ENTITY What? You don't think so? That's the nicest thing I've heard all day, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I can't WAIT to tell everyone you said that, $ENTITY !
OT ApA Always $ENTITY So, $ENTITY . Do you believe in UFOs, ... Yes, of course! No way.
OT ApA Always $ENTITY 
OT ApA Always $ENTITY 
OT ApA Always I'm with you, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I've seen the UFOs. Late at night. When everything $ENTITY is $ENTITY quiet... $ENTITY Oranges. Unidentified oranges.... Huh? What's the F stand for, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Floor, of course. $ENTITY I don't know who they belong to, or how they got on my floor, but I do eat them, $ENTITY !
OT ApA Always I agree completely, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I've seen those UFOs. Very late. When the town $ENTITY is $ENTITY calm... $ENTITY Oranges! Unidentified oranges! $ENTITY On my floor! $ENTITY Those UFOs are almost beyond belief. $ENTITY I don't have any proof they exist, $ENTITY . Because I always eat every one, $ENTITY !
OT ApA Always Oh, for sure, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I've spotted them. After midnight. The UFOs come $ENTITY out $ENTITY late... $ENTITY Oranges! Unidentified oranges! $ENTITY All over my floor!... Oh, those UFOs think they're tricky. But I refuse to have any strange citrus going rogue in my house.... They make a great midnight snack!
OT ApA Always $ENTITY I agree. There's no such thing as UFOs. But don't you wish there were, $ENTITY ?
OT ApA Always $ENTITY So you don't believe in UFOs? I don't either. But still, do you think they MIGHT exist? Maybe? $ENTITY No, you're right, $ENTITY . There's no way they actually exist, $ENTITY ...
OT ApA Always $ENTITY You don't? Oh, in that case... $ENTITY Forget I ever even brought it up, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It's silly to believe in UFOs, $ENTITY . I certainly don't!
