KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY It's always real lively when someone new moves into town, but.... Our town needs open spaces like this just as much! $ENTITY If we just kept building home after home, it'd look like the model-home display.... No, thanks!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Say, ... It seems somebody new is moving into town! $ENTITY I wonder what they'll be like... I'll have to think up a cool way to welcome them!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY what do you think of my house?... Doesn't it look great from every single angle? $ENTITY Of course the interior is nice, but I also put a lot of effort into the exterior's design as well! $ENTITY I suppose you could call it my baby! $ENTITY GAHAHA!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY I'm patrolling this area at the moment. $ENTITY said there were a whole bunch of pitfall seeds planted all around $ENTITY house! $ENTITY It was probably just a paranoid suspicion, but I gotta do this just in case!... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Heh heh... I saw that tent you live in!... It's pretty nice... for a tent! $ENTITY When I first started living on my own the first time, living outdoors was just how it had to be done. $ENTITY And look at me now! $ENTITY Owner of my own little castle!... Hang in there just a bit longer,... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY If you're just living by yourself, I think houses about the size of yours are more than big enough... Are you $ENTITY thinking about doing any more $ENTITY remodeling? $ENTITY Of course! Not at the moment...
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY First thing I thought of when I saw what $ENTITY was living in was... "Tents nowadays are huge!" $ENTITY Or is it just that $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY 's tents are top notch,... ?
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY 's house has a nice mailbox and a nice fence, but... It sure is a lot smaller than other houses in the area! $ENTITY Well, I suppose a modest home is better than a giant one with tons of empty rooms! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY The lights aren't on now, so I bet $ENTITY is out somewhere today. Don't you think? I need to talk to $ENTITY Ah well, maybe next time,... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY 's house is really impressive when you look at it up close! $ENTITY You have to pay a lot outta pocket when you build a house that huge, $ENTITY so it shows that $ENTITY #x0;'s $ENTITY #x0; loaded!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY When you take a really close look at $ENTITY 's house, it seems like a masterpiece of sorts... It's so tall! $ENTITY Just what you'd expect from ... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY When I was a kid and felt like going down to the beach, I wouldn't use the slope.... I'd just jump off the cliff! $ENTITY Looking back on it now, I'm lucky I didn't hurt myself more than a few bruises! $ENTITY GAHAHA!... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY The $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY building sure stands out... It makes my eyes hurt! $ENTITY At the same time, if I don't look at that pink monstrosity once a day, $ENTITY I don't feel my day is complete! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY That guy who does furniture remodeling in $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY is quite the character! $ENTITY I hear he left his young wife totally in charge of running the shop while he gets to sleep and lounge about. $ENTITY My kinda guy!... He's gruff but capable.... It's like we're kindred spirits of sorts!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY I'm reminded of my past. $ENTITY When I was a kid, I used to see if I could run faster than the trains in town. $ENTITY I'd stand all ready near the station and take off at the exact same time as the trains! $ENTITY Since the trains would get faster and faster,... proper stretching was really important.... GAHAHA!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY The boat dock has long been a site of fateful reunions and good-byes. $ENTITY You'd see people wait for those who'd never come home or people who'd try to stop someone leaving... These days,... the drama you see in town seems kinda tame, doesn't it?... GAHAHA!... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY For some reason, I always stand a little straighter when I pass by the police station.... , do you do that too? $ENTITY It's not like I've got a really guilty conscience or anything... Now that I think about it,... I'm not sure why I do it,... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY When you walk by here, $ENTITY you can smell the earthy scent of coffee floating through the air... Without even realizing it, my feet will start taking me right into the caf!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY My image of a mayor is someone who just sits at a desk and signs paperwork all day long... But it's pretty rare to see you in the town hall at all! $ENTITY Ah well. I suppose that's fitting for the mayor of $ENTITY , yeah?... #x0;m $ENTITY of the people!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY By the way... did you know our town hall has a pretty long history behind it? $ENTITY It's only lasted so long because the previous mayors have all taken such good care of it all these years! $ENTITY I'm sure it'll be run down before you know it, so Mayor $ENTITY better be really careful!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Listen up, ... Since you're a man too, $ENTITY I can understand if you dream of having a big house! ... Just talk to your wallet before making a decision!... 
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Listen up, ... All little girls dream of living in a great big house, right? $ENTITY Don't be satisfied with what you've got now!... Aim for something bigger and better! $ENTITY That's the true $ENTITY way!... GAHAHA!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Ooooh, look at you!... I'm gonna have to work hard to get my house to catch up to yours!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Yep, yep, $ENTITY the size of your house should fit your stature! $ENTITY If you wanna start living in a bigger house... it means you've matured a bit more!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Taking another look at your house now sure does remind me it's getting huge. $ENTITY I think big sprawling houses have more of an impact on neighbors than two-story ones,... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Say, ... just how much space do you have in that house of yours? $ENTITY A single kid like yourself living in a huge place like that... It's pretty darn impressive!... !
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY To expand up or out... That's the question! $ENTITY I'm talking about houses! $ENTITY Looking at your place makes me think wide houses like yours ain't so bad!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Around here we don't have any tall buildings. ... I bet the view from the second floor of your place is great! $ENTITY If I had the Bells, I'd gladly remodel my place, but... it won't be easy!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Hey, ... do you find it inconvenient to live in a two-story home like yours? $ENTITY I'm just gathering opinions to base my own remodels on... If you think of anything, let me know!
KO FreeB Spot $ENTITY Your house sure does stand out! $ENTITY I mean, it's so tall! $ENTITY Whether you want it to or not, it enters your field of vision!...
