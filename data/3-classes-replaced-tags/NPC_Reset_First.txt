NPC Reset First Hey, $ENTITY 'scuze me! $ENTITY Mind if I bend yer ear for a bit? $ENTITY Won't take a second.
NPC Reset First $ENTITY Lessee... $ENTITY Uh... $ENTITY Oh, right. I should introduce myself proper and such.... The name's $ENTITY Resetti $ENTITY . $ENTITY Most people call me Mr. $ENTITY Resetti... on account of me bein' a respected member of the community and such. Lookin' forward to workin' with ya!
NPC Reset First ... Course, $ENTITY this'll probably be the last time ya ever see me since there ain't no center or nothin'... Ahem, $ENTITY so, it says here you quit without saving last time ya played. $ENTITY Care to explain yourself? $ENTITY I wanted a do-over. My batteries ran out. I had no choice!
NPC Reset First $ENTITY #x0;Oh, $ENTITY a do-over, huh?... Somethin' didn't quite go your way, $ENTITY is that the deal? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess that's one way to play it... But don't ya think that just maybe it'd be more rewardin'... to roll with them punches you're takin'? $ENTITY That's definitely how I'd most likely recommend ya play the game. $ENTITY Don'tcha wanna do the right thing and save? $ENTITY For the kids? $ENTITY For the whales? C'monsave the whales!
NPC Reset First $ENTITY Aw, man, $ENTITY ain't that a kick in the moleskins! $ENTITY 'Tween you and me,... them batteries don't last... quite as long as they used to when I was a li'l mole... . $ENTITY D'ya think I could get ya to be more careful about charging up in a timely manner going forward from here? $ENTITY 'Preciate it... .
NPC Reset First $ENTITY WHAT?!... Haaaaa, $ENTITY that's a darned shame is what that is! $ENTITY I dunno nuthin' about machines,... so I can't really help ya out there. $ENTITY But I hope from the bottom of my mole heart... that such an awful thing never happens to you again!
NPC Reset First $ENTITY Wassat? $ENTITY You were expecting something a little different? $ENTITY Heh... Yeah, here's the thing. $ENTITY The Reset Surveillance Center? It don't exist no more. $ENTITY 
NPC Reset First $ENTITY When they were drawin' up the town budget for this fiscal year, $ENTITY folks were all like: $ENTITY "What's wrong with a little reset every now and then?" "We don't got the funds for this nonsense!"... Blah blah and so on and so forth... . $ENTITY So ya see, I ain't here on official business or nothin'.... I'm just volunteerin' this once. $ENTITY So next time you reset, $ENTITY I ain't gonna pop out.... This is it. $ENTITY Ol' Resetti's out... .
NPC Reset First $ENTITY Course, $ENTITY if you were to use your $ENTITY mayoral powers to restore the center, $ENTITY well that'd be different. $ENTITY And $ENTITY if that should come to pass,... I'd be back on the job in full force! Unstoppable mole power!
NPC Reset First $ENTITY Course, $ENTITY if you were to lean on the mayor to bring the center back, $ENTITY that'd be a whole 'nother story. $ENTITY And $ENTITY if that should happen,... I tell ya I'd be back and better than ever! Overwhelming mole power!
NPC Reset First $ENTITY But listen to me!... Runnin' my trap like a fancy pirate or somethin'! $ENTITY Good luck with all your future endeavors! $ENTITY Take care now! $ENTITY And buh- $ENTITY bye! $ENTITY
