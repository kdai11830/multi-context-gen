ZK Re Q04 ... what in the world happened? $ENTITY We were heading toward a place, and then everything became dark all of a sudden... Now I can't remember anything from that time forward. $ENTITY Are you hiding something?... I understand, ... This is just our secret... 
ZK Re Q04 I don't remember it clearly, $ENTITY but... you suddenly disappeared while we were heading somewhere, $ENTITY didn't you, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY One minute you're here, $ENTITY the next, it's all "Ninja Vanish!" $ENTITY Do I really embarrass you that much when we walk together? ... Well, it's not a super-big deal, I guess.
