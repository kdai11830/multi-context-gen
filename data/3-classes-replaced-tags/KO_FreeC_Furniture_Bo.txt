KO FreeC Furniture_Bo $ENTITY This song... I'm sure the title is ... I guess $ENTITY has grown up enough to put on some nice music for his guests!... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Bo $ENTITY gets completely entranced when he's watching something on television. $ENTITY He won't respond, even if you call his name... I guess you could say his ability to focus is pretty amazing!
KO FreeC Furniture_Bo $ENTITY Have you ever heard one of the little ditties $ENTITY 's composed over the years? $ENTITY To be honest, he's just at the humming level... But at least he hums pretty well! $ENTITY If you get the chance, you should ask him to perform one along with his $ENTITY !
KO FreeC Furniture_Bo $ENTITY I never thought I'd ever actually see $ENTITY here in $ENTITY 's house! $ENTITY You don't think he tries to cook by himself, do you?... Now I'm worried...

KO FreeC Furniture_Bo $ENTITY Say, don't you think this place is a lot better organized than you'd expect from $ENTITY ? I wonder what the inside of the $ENTITY looks like, though... I can't look,... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Bo ... Say, $ENTITY do you think $ENTITY uses the $ENTITY to make coffee? $ENTITY He doesn't seem the type who likes coffee enough to drink it at home. ... I'm surprised!
