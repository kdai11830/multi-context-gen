ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I bet she needs a larger bed because she tosses and turns while sleeping!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY How come $ENTITY has a two-seat couch even though she lives all by herself... ? $ENTITY Knowing how she is, $ENTITY she probably thinks the bigger it is, the better it looks,... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Listen up, ... You can guess one's tastes simply by looking at the chairs one picks out. $ENTITY Let's consider $ENTITY 's chair for a moment... Oh, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY It really does seem like something she'd choose, $ENTITY huh?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY 's ... I have a feeling it's just filled with clothes and food and little else,... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY But I wonder... Do you think that's $ENTITY 's favorite piece of clothing? $ENTITY Well, as the official $ENTITY fashion representative, I can confirm... it is acceptable.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY ! Well, $ENTITY she's not the only one in this room who looks good in a mirror.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge Earlier $ENTITY I found a book called $ENTITY on the $ENTITY . ... I wonder if $ENTITY is really reading it or just likes having it on her bookshelf.... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY it looks like $ENTITY made some tea for us,... I always thought she was a tomboy, $ENTITY but surprisingly $ENTITY she seems to have a refined side too!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge ... there's ... Oh! $ENTITY might not like it if we keep staring at it, ... No! Don't stare! $ENTITY And stop thinking about staring! Darn it, I just thought about staring. $ENTITY I'm bad at this.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY actually knows how to use her ... This might just be her idea of keeping up with the popular trends,... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Ah,... How very gorgeous... Perhaps $ENTITY decorated her room just for me? $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I guess she knows how to spiff things up if she wants to. I approve!... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge ... What could be in it? $ENTITY I'm scared to look inside for a lot of complicated reasons... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Oh, wow. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY owns $ENTITY Uhh, $ENTITY never mind... I bet it's just something her mom gave her and she never got rid of.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Ah,... Huh... I really didn't expect to see a game system in $ENTITY 's room. $ENTITY I'll have to see if she'd be up for a round of Ultra Crash Sisters!... I bet she'll beat me too! Hah ha!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge The $ENTITY in her room seems kinda dirty... Perhaps this is $ENTITY 's cuddly friend? $ENTITY I bet she squeezes it every night before bed... What?! Who told you I do too?! $ENTITY And how do they know about Mr. Fluffy-Snuggles?!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge ... It reminds me of my childhood... .

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Oh my goodness, $ENTITY there's ... Let's stop this,... might not like us inspecting everything she owns!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Huh. $ENTITY I wonder why there's $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's house! Perhaps for guests... She doesn't seem the type to be overly considerate, though... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge The $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's room... It makes one feel like this room really belongs to her, $ENTITY don't you think,... ?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY has a fancy $ENTITY but I wonder if she can play. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY knowing her, $ENTITY even if she can't play the guitar, $ENTITY she'd still set it up in her room purely to look cool.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Awww... . It's so ... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY So this is $ENTITY 's room. It's exactly how I pictured it!
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Heh heh heh.... might not like it if you keep looking around like that.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Huh... For some reason, $ENTITY it smells like ... Or is that just my imagination?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Welcome to $ENTITY 's room! $ENTITY Please make yourself at home, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I guess I'm not in a position to say that, huh... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY really chose all the furniture herself.
