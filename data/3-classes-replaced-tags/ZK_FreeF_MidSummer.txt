ZK FreeF MidSummer On the $ENTITY Summer Solstice... we're treated to both the longest day and the shortest night of the year. Wild! After today, $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY are supposed to come... Are you ready for them yet,... ?
ZK FreeF MidSummer ... You're asking me $ENTITY why the sun won't set today? $ENTITY I don't know! $ENTITY Maybe the sun is just jealous of my good looks?... Hah ha!
ZK FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY isn't sleeping at all today, even if it wants to... So $ENTITY if you're having a hard time sleeping at any point, $ENTITY you should come over to my place!... Ooh! We can sit around and talk about who has cooties and who we think is cool!... !
ZK FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY Having the sun out for so long almost makes me feel like we're in a dream... That means we can do whatever we want to, right?... Hah ha!... Uh, $ENTITY I can't really think of anything crazy to do. $ENTITY Does that make me kinda boring? $ENTITY 
ZK FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY Listen, ... I came up with a special message,... You... are my sun that never sets! $ENTITY What do you think? Pretty good, isn't it? $ENTITY But problem is, my clever, poetic statement only really works today because of the $ENTITY Summer Solstice... Gah! I've gotta hurry then! I've got a lot of girls to talk to and no time to do it!
