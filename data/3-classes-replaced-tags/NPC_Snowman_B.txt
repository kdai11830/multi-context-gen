Oh my! I... I see you're already well acquainted with this whole $ENTITY snowflake $ENTITY business, aren't you? $ENTITY Would you be willing to part with yours? $ENTITY Here you go! Sorry, no.
NPC Snowman B $ENTITY Oh my! I wonder who made this perfectly sculpted figure of mine! $ENTITY Was it... you? $ENTITY This is wonderful! How did you get to be so skilled? $ENTITY Oh! One with your talents would surely be able to help a little snow lady with a tiny favor, right? Would you be willing to help me find $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY ? It's become quite the delightful hobby for me! Their sparkles fill my heart with joy, so I've been collecting them.... Oh? $ENTITY I see you're no stranger to $ENTITY snowflakes... If you can find and bring me $ENTITY 3 $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY , I will reward you handsomely. I have high hopes for you! Good luck on your search!
NPC Snowman B Yaaaaaawn... Oh? $ENTITY How long have I been asleep? $ENTITY Oh my! $ENTITY This perfect balance of head and body... I'm PERFECT! $ENTITY To be able to make me so beautiful is an amazing talent. You are so obviously gifted... Oh, yes! Perhaps one so blessed in the art of snow crafting can do a small favor for me?

Would you be willing to part with those? If you give me ... of them, I'll give you something good! $ENTITY Sure! Nope.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! This head! This body. You put me together so well! $ENTITY I'm very pleased you made me with such beauty and refinement! $ENTITY Pardon my inquisitiveness, but you wouldn't happen to have any $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY on you, would you? $ENTITY How beautiful! Snowflake collecting is actually a hobby of mine. $ENTITY If you bring me $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY , I'll reward you with something nice! But 1 or 2 flakes won't do!

NPC Snowman B Well, good day! My name is $ENTITY Snowmam $ENTITY . It's such a pleasure to meet you! If you don't mind me saying, you have such an interesting sense of balance... Quite frankly, I had a bad feeling while you were rolling me up! $ENTITY I was trying to tell you, "Bigger!" and "Smaller!" and the like. $ENTITY But I suppose those cries from my simple snow heart fell on deaf ears.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! Are you the one who made me? $ENTITY Thank you very much!... But to be honest, I would have appreciated a little more balance in my form. $ENTITY You must understand, the beauty of a snowperson is entirely dependent upon the hands of the creator. Next time you make me, I'd like it if you could keep my head slightly smaller than my body... 
NPC Snowman B $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY What is this?! $ENTITY Such imbalance! Such mismatched sphereocity! I'll be the laughingstock of the entire town! $ENTITY Hey! Did you just laugh? Do you think this is funny? Might I remind you that this is your handiwork? $ENTITY Ugh! Fine! Laugh all you want! $ENTITY I'll just be that weird-looking snowlady people make fun of!
NPC Snowman B Oh! Good day! $ENTITY Um... My head is... a bit off, is it not? $ENTITY Ugh! Did you even pay attention when you were making me?! $ENTITY You are my creator! $ENTITY Do something!... Aaaarghh $ENTITY I was momentarily overcome with frustration. That was very immature of me. I know it's too late to do anything about it. $ENTITY Thank you for making me, but please do be careful the next time you stack snowballs.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! You seem to have what I want. You don't even have to say anything. I can just tell! You know how much I like $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY , don't you? $ENTITY How about a trade? You give me snowflakes, and I give you something nice in return! What do you say? $ENTITY Here you go! Nope.
NPC Snowman B Oh! My $ENTITY snowflake $ENTITY senses are tingling! $ENTITY So if you do have any snowflakes and I think you domay I have them? $ENTITY I'll give you something nice! $ENTITY Here you go! Nope.
NPC Snowman B So you'll give me $ENTITY 3 $ENTITY snowflakes $ENTITY ?

I know you can do it! $ENTITY Good luck!

NPC Snowman B Are you curious about the bun on my head? You are welcome to touch it. It's only a snowball... .
NPC Snowman B "Beauty is only snow deep." $ENTITY Are you familiar with this saying?
NPC Snowman B Remember, always try to make snowpeople as handsome or beautiful as you can!
NPC Snowman B Hot! It's hot! I'd love an ice-cold iced tea right now.
NPC Snowman B The snow has melted quite a bit, hasn't it?
NPC Snowman B This unbearable heat... I don't think I can take anymore! Someone turn on the air conditioner! Hmm? You use them inside? That's a shame... .
NPC Snowman B Yaaaaaaawn... Spring is a sleepy season, isn't it?
NPC Snowman B The season for snowpeople has come to an end... I hope to see you next winter! I must be going soon!
NPC Snowman B I know, I know... You're thinking, "Wow! That is one resistant snowlady!" But I won't last forever! And I hope to see you next winter!
NPC Snowman B Oh? This isn't enough. $ENTITY Do you... not want to do this? $ENTITY You can have them. Never mind.
NPC Snowman B Really? $ENTITY That's a shame... .
