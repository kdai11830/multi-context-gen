OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I can't believe $ENTITY has a piece of framed art that's not from a comic book. $ENTITY And $ENTITY , no less!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge I fear for the future of this poor $ENTITY remembering to water it every day? $ENTITY That's what I thought.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Oh no,... plays the ... I can only assume a self-titled debut album is forthcoming... 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY What? $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY has ... And it's even nicer than mine? $ENTITY , this isn't fair!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY , $ENTITY this is a giant $ENTITY for $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Then again, $ENTITY she does have big hair...

OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Somebody once told me they could tell everything they needed to know about people by their chairs. $ENTITY I don't know about that. $ENTITY This $ENTITY doesn't say much about $ENTITY .
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I'd open $ENTITY 's $ENTITY and peek inside... But I didn't bring my hazmat suit today.

OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I wonder why $ENTITY picked this particular outfit to set out on display. I mean, $ENTITY it's cute, $ENTITY but it's not THAT cute. $ENTITY !

OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I found a copy of $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's room. $ENTITY I'm guessing she just uses it to smash bugs.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Heh heh. $ENTITY Looks like $ENTITY left her $ENTITY out. $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY She owns ... I'm impressed.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I suppose it's possible that $ENTITY unearthed this $ENTITY herself... But it seems more likely she won it out of one of those claw machines at the arcade.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY Someone broke into $ENTITY 's place and made tea! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY how else do you explain this $ENTITY Are you implying $ENTITY drinks tea?
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY The thing about $ENTITY is that you wouldn't expect her to own ... But at the same time, $ENTITY I wouldn't be surprised to learn she's some kind of elite hacker or something.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY left out ... for me? $ENTITY I take back everything bad I've ever said about her!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Should we peek inside $ENTITY 's $ENTITY and see if there's anything good to eat? $ENTITY No, $ENTITY you're right. $ENTITY It's probably just filled with ketchup and $ENTITY leftovers.

OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY This $ENTITY kind of reminds me of ... Plush-animal owners really do look like their plush animals.

OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY So $ENTITY has ... in her place. $ENTITY For some reason, $ENTITY this doesn't surprise me.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY This $ENTITY seems particularly well suited to $ENTITY 's tastes. $ENTITY I didn't realize she was so self-aware.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I can't believe there's $ENTITY here and nobody told me! $ENTITY I would have been so much nicer to ... 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I knew $ENTITY would have one of these for some reason. $ENTITY And that reason is that I'm partially psychic.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I could see myself living here.... 's style isn't as different from mine as you might expect.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I'm not sure $ENTITY would appreciate us going through her stuff. Then again,... maybe she would. $ENTITY I guess we'll never know unless we try.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I always imagined that $ENTITY 's place would smell like $ENTITY . $ENTITY But it actually smells kind of like $ENTITY The more you know!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY Less talk, $ENTITY more snooping!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ge $ENTITY I have a hard time believing $ENTITY picked out all this stuff herself. $ENTITY No, $ENTITY you're right. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY , after all.
