AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Yo, $ENTITY ! So you're, like, the mayor, right? $ENTITY Don't you need to make some laws and stuff? $ENTITY I'm kind of a rebel, but even I'm looking forward to whatever you're gonna come up with, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY I just realized... our town doesn't really have any laws and rules and stuff like that... That's weird, right? I mean, there's freedom, and then there's just being sloppy! $ENTITY I'm kind of a rebel, but even I think some rules meant to improve this town would be OK, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Hey! So are there any ordinances or set rules and stuff in ... 'Cause we don't have any here! $ENTITY We're not wild or anything. It's just that things are working without 'em. $ENTITY So far, at least... 
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY This is weird, but... I've been going to bed earlier lately! $ENTITY 'Cause of the $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY law, I guess. $ENTITY I tend to have more energy and get out more during the day, get more shopping done... And I feel great! $ENTITY I'm not normally a follow-the-rules kinda gal, but this is OK so far! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Hey, what do you think of the $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY ordinance in this town? $ENTITY I think it's a pretty big success!... Even I've been able to get up early! $ENTITY And having the stores open up early is fine by me! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Right now there's an $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY law in effect in ... It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like, and it gets everyone up and active earlier in the day!... The stores are open earlier too! $ENTITY It was a bit rough at first, but now I get a lot done during the daylight hours, so I like it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY This $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY thing you made... It's awesome! $ENTITY Now I can hang out with all those folks who used to go to bed early. $ENTITY And I love that the stores are open late now too!
AN FreeA Regulation Hey!... So how's the $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY ordinance treating you? $ENTITY I was always a night person, so now that the stores are open late, I just wanna dance! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Do you know about the $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY law we have here in ... As you can guess from the name, it's a rule that supports those who like to stay up late. $ENTITY Thanks to this rule, the stores stay open late! $ENTITY It's a huge help for us creatures of the night!
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY That whatever-it's-called ordinance thing you came up with... is great! $ENTITY I was surprised by how much I could sell stuff for at Re-Tail! $ENTITY But then I went nuts and blew my extra cash in the shopping district... Maybe that's kinda the point? $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY That law Mayor $ENTITY made, where prices are raised in stores and stuff... You know about that? $ENTITY When I first heard about it, I was like, "What are you doing?!" But it's actually pretty great! $ENTITY Re-Tail is paying big Bells for stuff, so I'm really raking it in! $ENTITY Course, that just makes me want to go spend it all! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Right now in my town there's this ordinance that's making everything cost more Bells! $ENTITY On the other hand, Re-Tail pays a ton of Bells for my stuff. $ENTITY So if you sell a lot and don't buy much... Well, I'm no math whiz, but it seems like you'd come out ahead!
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Oh, right! $ENTITY The $ENTITY Keep... Beautiful $ENTITY law you made? $ENTITY I think it might be working! $ENTITY I mean, you can leave a house empty for a while and those things don't show up!... Those things! $ENTITY It makes me so happy, I can feel it in my bones! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY Right now our mayor has this cool $ENTITY Keep... Beautiful $ENTITY law in effect.... I think it might be working! $ENTITY I didn't really care one way or the other at first, but... when I fish now, I don't catch much garbage at all! $ENTITY It used to be bad! $ENTITY I'd be sure I had a big fish on the line, and then I'd pull up a tire! $ENTITY Gaaaaaah! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Regulation $ENTITY We have this cool $ENTITY Keep... Beautiful $ENTITY law in place right now. $ENTITY Did you know that? $ENTITY It just means everyone concentrates on not letting garbage and weeds get outta hand!... But... it's working!... You can leave your house empty for a while, and those things don't show up! $ENTITY You know... THOSE THINGS!
