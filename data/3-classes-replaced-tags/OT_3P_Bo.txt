OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Now, let me try to explain this again, $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's crucial to eat balanced meals.... 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY I'm still not getting it! $ENTITY You mean, a meal you eat while balancing ON something? $ENTITY Wouldn't that be hard, eating $ENTITY while balancing on $ENTITY 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY No! That's not what a balanced meal is! You've got it all wrong.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY I got it backward? $ENTITY OK.... I'll balance $ENTITY on my head while eating $ENTITY ! That still sounds hard, $ENTITY though.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Yes, well, not as hard as trying to explain this.... yet again.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You're here just in time. $ENTITY is trying to figure out what's in a PB-and-J sandwich.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY I know, I know! Don't rush me! It's peanut butter and.... 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Oh, you silly thing. $ENTITY You know it's got to be a J word. $ENTITY Come on. $ENTITY You can do it, $ENTITY !
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY I hate it when she treats me like I don't know anything! $ENTITY But, uh, do YOU know, ... Jelly. Jewels. Junk. Jellyfish.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Jelly? $ENTITY Oh yeah, that's right! $ENTITY It's totally jelly.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY I don't think you could have figured that out on your own! $ENTITY Tell me this then! $ENTITY What KIND of jelly?
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY You think I don't know that.... 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Jewels? $ENTITY Oh yeah, I knew that! It's totally jewels!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Wouldn't that be crunchy? $ENTITY I mean, you need the crust cut off sandwiches. $ENTITY You'd eat jewels?
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Uh, yeah.... But who cares? I like my PB without the J anyway!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Er.... that's right. I remember now. $ENTITY Peanut butter and junk!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Listen, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Don't go telling him that. He'll actually go out and eat a PB-and-junk sandwich! $ENTITY Now, you know that's not what the J stands for, right?
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Oh, don't try to fake me out. Didn't you ever hear of junk food? $ENTITY You think you're so smart!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Jellyfish? Er.... Uh.... Really? $ENTITY Because that sounds totally delicious, $ENTITY !
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Seriously? $ENTITY Jellyfish? $ENTITY That doesn't sound completely wrong?
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Mmmm...squiggly delicious!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY There is something very wrong with that stomach of yours.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you're in luck,... here is talking about his love of swirly straws.
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Oh yeah! They're totally perfect for drinking $ENTITY 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Really.... for $ENTITY 
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Just imagine the $ENTITY doing loop the loops right into your mouth.... It's awesome!
OT 3P Bo $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY if you say so,... . $ENTITY I'm just glad you're not drinking out of a sippy cup, $ENTITY .
