ZK Dt Museum_Insect To be completely honest, $ENTITY I'm not particularly fond of most insects.
ZK Dt Museum_Insect You think $ENTITY I could ever grow to be on speaking terms with insects?... I guess it'd just take a lot of time... 
ZK Dt Museum_Insect $ENTITY If you take a close look at bugs, $ENTITY they all look kind of like little nightmares, right,... ?
ZK Dt Museum_Insect I guess this is sort of a bad place to be all alone and afraid of bugs... 
ZK Dt Museum_Insect $ENTITY They keep just flying and jumping... They're all so busy, aren't they?
