BO ApA Always Hey,... On a scale from 0 to 100 percent, how good do you feel right now? $ENTITY 100% 0%
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Well, since we're both feeling great, $ENTITY we should have an eating contest! $ENTITY We'll eat... ! $ENTITY Whoever wins goes on to represent $ENTITY in the semifinals! $ENTITY Of course, there are no losers in this $ENTITY -eating contest, ... 
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY You're feeling pretty darn good, aren't you!... Me too, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'm feeling so good, I'm even going to give $ENTITY some of my extra cheerfulness!
BO ApA Always $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You're just fine?... Well, that doesn't sound very great... Oh, I know! $ENTITY Why don't you go chow down on some ... Like a whole mountain of it! $ENTITY That always cheers me up when I'm feeling "just fine."... !
BO ApA Always Oh, $ENTITY you're not feeling so hot?... You should do what I do: stuff your face with $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Chewing is great exercise, $ENTITY and if you do enough of it, $ENTITY you can really get your heart rate up. $ENTITY The more you eat, $ENTITY the more you exercise, and the better you feel. $ENTITY Now THAT is a fitness plan! $ENTITY I should really go into personal training,... 
BO ApA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You're feeling 0 percent? $ENTITY You hide it really well. $ENTITY I guess you're the strong and silent type, $ENTITY huh. $ENTITY That's cool and all.... But don't keep it all bottled up inside. That's bad for your health,... .
BO ApA Always Hey, $ENTITY so $ENTITY how light do you keep your room when you're sleeping, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Bright Pitch black
BO ApA Always $ENTITY So you sleep with the light on,... I'm scared of the dark too. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY technically, $ENTITY it isn't the dark I'm scared of... so much as the monsters IN the dark,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Then you must love napping right before the sun goes down, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Napping before dinner is the BEST! $ENTITY Yaaaaawn... $ENTITY Even imagining it is so delicious,... !
BO ApA Always $ENTITY So you like just a tiny bit of light, $ENTITY huh? $ENTITY I like that too.... It makes everything sooo chill,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY You sleep with the lights completely off, $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY That's so brave! $ENTITY I tried that once. $ENTITY At first I couldn't see a thing, but after a while, my eyes got used to the dark. $ENTITY True story. $ENTITY You can't make stuff like this up,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Hey, so I want to get your opinion on something. $ENTITY At what age do you think you start being a grown-up? $ENTITY 40 10
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY that sounds like a pretty grown-up age. $ENTITY I can't wait till I'm that old. $ENTITY Then I can spend my entire allowance on comic books and video games, $ENTITY and no one can stop me!
BO ApA Always Hmm... $ENTITY I see where you're coming from. $ENTITY There's just one other thing I've always wondered. $ENTITY Do you get a party and cake when you become a grown-up? $ENTITY I sure hope so,... !
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Yep, I totally agree! $ENTITY But I was also wondering something else... $ENTITY I heard that you grow big horns $ENTITY and crazy fangs when you turn into a grown-up. $ENTITY Oh, no, no, no! $ENTITY That's not right at all!... That was $ENTITY gargoyles I was thinking of, not grown-ups.
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Seriously? $ENTITY You really think that?... Well, if that's the case, I guess I'm all grown up! $ENTITY Cool! Then that means I can eat as much $ENTITY as I want,... !
BO ApA Always Hey hey, ... There's something I've been meaning to ask you. $ENTITY Would you say that you're more into the ocean $ENTITY or mountains? $ENTITY Mountains Ocean
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Whaaat! $ENTITY I never would've guessed that you'd be a mountain person,... ! $ENTITY Personally, $ENTITY I'd choose swimming and eating fish over hiking uphill any day,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Oh, really? $ENTITY So you're more of a mountain person, huh? $ENTITY Well, don't just keep it inside! $ENTITY If I were you, $ENTITY I'd face the mountains and yell at the top of my lungs,... HEY, MOUNTAINS! WHAT'S UP? $ENTITY !" Yep. You should definitely just yell,... HEY, MOUNTAINS! WHAT'S UP? $ENTITY !"... It's really fun,... 
BO ApA Always $ENTITY So... That means you like the ocean and mountains equally, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Me too. Trying to choose between them is like choosing between peanut butter and jelly. $ENTITY Can't do it!
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Seriously? $ENTITY So if you had to choose, you'd say you like the ocean better, $ENTITY ? But the water in the ocean is so salty, $ENTITY you can't even drink it,... ! $ENTITY What's more, mountains have snow!... Which means all-you-can-eat sno-cone action!
BO ApA Always $ENTITY A huh huh huh! $ENTITY I love the ocean best too! $ENTITY It's got everything I need: fish, shrimp, crab, lobsters... . $ENTITY It's basically a barbecue waiting to happen,... I'm glad we agree on the important stuff,... .
BO ApA Always Hey, $ENTITY I have an important question for you. $ENTITY Do you like sweet or spicy food better, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY #x1E; Sweet Spicy
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY We have so much in common! $ENTITY I love all food, $ENTITY but I especially like sweet stuff,... ! $ENTITY I love it so much that I named my bike... ! $ENTITY No joke,... 
BO ApA Always $ENTITY So $ENTITY that either means you like things that are sweet and spicy, $ENTITY or it means you only like bland food. $ENTITY You can be awfully inscrutable sometimes,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY I like spicy stuff too!... Especially curry that's so hot it makes you sweat and cry at the same time! $ENTITY Whew!... I'm getting sweaty and hungry just thinking about it,... !
BO ApA Always OK, if there was a string that connected us,... what color $ENTITY do you think that string would be?... #x0; $ENTITY Yellow, for sure! Red, I think! Probably blue. Brown? Maybe white.
BO ApA Always A yellow string, huh?... So that means our friendship is totally sunny, right,... ? $ENTITY I guess it could also mean that our friendship is scared... But sunny makes more sense,... .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY Red?!... Just what are you trying to say, ... I think I'm a little too chill for a color as hot as red, $ENTITY .
BO ApA Always $ENTITY We're connected by a blue string? $ENTITY What does that mean?... It must mean that our friendship is chill!
BO ApA Always $ENTITY A brown string, huh? $ENTITY It's like the silk on an ear of corn,... So it's pretty delicate, $ENTITY but it holds $ENTITY something delicious inside! $ENTITY Yep, that's our friendship all right.
BO ApA Always $ENTITY Uh... $ENTITY so you and I are connected by a cheap kite string? $ENTITY Is that what you're trying to say,... ?
