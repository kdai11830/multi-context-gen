OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I think I rather like this town... 
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY are you just visiting here as well? $ENTITY It sure seems like a popular tourist destination.
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY is a great town, $ENTITY isn't it?... Everyone I've met so far has been really nice!
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Are you from this town originally? $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY me either. $ENTITY I was hoping you could show me around.
OT Sp Camp_Tent I'm usually not one for camping, $ENTITY but I'm glad I made the trip here to $ENTITY .
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY are you from around here? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY great! $ENTITY I've been looking for a local to chat with. $ENTITY I'm just camping here in $ENTITY for a little while, $ENTITY but the town is really growing on me. $ENTITY Who knows? $ENTITY Maybe someday you and I will be neighbors!
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY You're from ... right? $ENTITY Oh, good. I was hoping to meet some people from around here. $ENTITY I'm just in town camping for a bit. I needed a little break from my hometown. $ENTITY Of course if things work out, $ENTITY I may end up moving here. $ENTITY You never know... 
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Hey there, $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'm just in $ENTITY camping for a little while. $ENTITY It's a great place you've got here. $ENTITY I've actually been thinking about moving here permanently... 
OT Sp Camp_Tent All right, $ENTITY . $ENTITY You invited me here to ... so now you have to help me find a place to live! $ENTITY But don't worry. $ENTITY I'm not super picky or anything. $ENTITY Any ordinary manor or estate with an ocean view will do just fine... 
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY where should I build my house... Help me figure out where to live!
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Everything you told me about $ENTITY was true, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY I did just move my entire life here based on a single conversation... I could use a little reassuring.
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Guess what? $ENTITY I'm moving here! $ENTITY And it's all thanks to $ENTITY .
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Big news: $ENTITY I'm moving to $ENTITY for good! $ENTITY You can thank ... #x0; was really persuasive. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY we should hang out sometime once I get settled.... !
OT Sp Camp_Tent Well, $ENTITY I'm finally doing it. $ENTITY I'm moving to ... I've always liked visiting, $ENTITY but then $ENTITY convinced me I should just live here. $ENTITY I hope we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. $ENTITY !
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I wouldn't call it a midlife crisis. $ENTITY But I feel like I need to make a change. $ENTITY That's why I'm out here freezing my face off in a tent!
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Starting over in a new town without any friends is kind of like playing life on hard mode.
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY So here I am, $ENTITY camping out in the wilderness on a journey of self-discovery. $ENTITY Yuck. $ENTITY When I say it out loud like that, $ENTITY it does NOT sound appealing.
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY "The stew needs more fish sticks. $ENTITY There. $ENTITY Now add the ... " ... Huh? $ENTITY Was I talking in my sleep?
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I'd like camping a whole lot more if I didn't have to sleep in a sleeping bag like this. $ENTITY Just give me a queen-size bed and some walls, $ENTITY and I will gladly camp year round!
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY even though I don't like camping much, $ENTITY I feel like hanging around in $ENTITY a bit longer. It's like I just don't want my vacation to end, $ENTITY you know? $ENTITY You should move here! Vacation's over.
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY The time I've spent in this town has got me thinking... What if I moved here permanently?... Do you think that's a good idea? $ENTITY Yes, you should move! I'm not so sure...
OT Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY There's something about $ENTITY that just calls to me. $ENTITY I'm actually thinking of moving here and putting down roots. $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Great idea! This town is overrated.
OT Sp Camp_Tent Yeah, $ENTITY you're right. $ENTITY The grass is always greener, $ENTITY isn't it? $ENTITY And every vacation ends sometime. $ENTITY Good-bye! $ENTITY Maybe we'll meet again someday.
OT Sp Camp_Tent I suppose I should think about it a while longer. $ENTITY I got a little bit carried away. It's just that $ENTITY is so nice.... Well, $ENTITY I have time. $ENTITY I'll just keep camping and thinking... 
OT Sp Camp_Tent Yeah, $ENTITY it's possible that I only like $ENTITY so much because it's different. $ENTITY , $ENTITY I still have time left to camp and just enjoy the town. $ENTITY See you around!
