NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Aha! Cousin! $ENTITY I just know this work of art will find its true home now that you've decided to buy. I'll be sending your purchase off to ya as soon as the exhibition is over, so keep watch for it!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Thanks, cuz! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi ... Thanks, $ENTITY cuz! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Ah! $ENTITY Welcome, welcome! $ENTITY Thank ya for visitin' my shop!... . $ENTITY Oh!... Could this be your first time here meetin' ol' $ENTITY Redd... Well, ain't that lovely!... I'm always happy to meet fellow art lovers! $ENTITY This is $ENTITY Redd's Gallery $ENTITY , where we specialize exclusively in the finest art $ENTITY you'll ever see in this world!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY This is your one and only chance to buy a piece of famous art $ENTITY for a bargain that can only be CRAAAZY! $ENTITY But of course, since these are all $ENTITY really rare items, $ENTITY we sell only one item per customer! Why, ya ask? Because a bargain THIS crazy wouldn't be fair without some limits. I'd be penniless! $ENTITY So come on in! $ENTITY Don't be shy! Look around all ya want! $ENTITY Hee hee hee! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Well now, $ENTITY welcome, welcome!... Please come on in! $ENTITY Ahh! $ENTITY I'm so glad to see a cousin come back for a second glance!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY I'll tell ya, this week's items are as rare as they come. $ENTITY I'm almost green with envy that I can't buy 'em all! $ENTITY But remember, we sell only one item per customer, $ENTITY so make your choice very carefully! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY I've already had some interest today in the wares, $ENTITY so if there's anythin' ya like, now's the time to strike!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY We've had a busy morning, so we're down to our last item! $ENTITY You'd be smart to buy it up right away!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Well now, $ENTITY if it isn't ... How've ya been, cousin? Still well since we last spoke? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I see! You've got to wait a little longer for your item! $ENTITY With bargains this low, $ENTITY I've gotta ensure the orders are all correct. $ENTITY Ya can't purchase anything else until your order comes in, but $ENTITY you're welcome to look around!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Oh ho, $ENTITY welcome to my gallery!... Come in and see some art! $ENTITY Oh boy! $ENTITY Cousin! $ENTITY When was the last time you were here?... Well, I'm rather pleased to see ya back again!
NPC Tunekichi ... Oh yes, before I forget!... The item you bought last time will be getting delivered fairly soon. I can't let you buy anything else until it comes in, but $ENTITY you're more than welcome to look around!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Hi! $ENTITY Welcome! Come on in! $ENTITY How can I help you? $ENTITY Ahh! $ENTITY You're from $ENTITY , aren't ya? $ENTITY Comin' all this way to see my magnificent gallery? $ENTITY It seems we have a bargain hunter here!
NPC Tunekichi Sorryonly one item per customer per visit. Otherwise ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY 'll go broke. $ENTITY But feel free to browse!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Hold up there, cuz! $ENTITY We're actually right at closin' time. $ENTITY Sorry to say it, but you'll have to come see me some other time! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Trust me, cuz! $ENTITY You made a really smart purchase just now! $ENTITY If ya only knew the faces people wear when they see these sold-out signs! Truly heartbreaking! $ENTITY And also a pity! $ENTITY If it were up to me, I'd help them out and sell the same item all over again. $ENTITY Just thinkin' about bringin' that sort of joy to people's lives is makin' me tear up... .
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Ya might not realize it... but one simple conversation and I can tell that $ENTITY you, cuz, love the arts!... It makes trips out here to $ENTITY all worth the effort! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY You've gotta wait a bit longer until your previous item is delivered. I can't sell ya more until it arrives! $ENTITY And to make matters worse, if your mailbox is full, that item won't fit! Be careful about that, cousin!
NPC Tunekichi You, cuz, are in luck! You have the pick of the litter for any single item ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY has in his gallery today! Don't miss out on an opportunity like this! It's good luck is what it is! Remember $ENTITY first come, best served!
NPC Tunekichi Would ya believe we were full this morning? My bargains are so crazy, we're sellin' stuff FAST!... You've got no time to lose! I'd tell ya to choose somethin' quickly, but I trust your judgment... .
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Cousin, ya came just in time! $ENTITY I'm down to one last item here! Can you believe this generosity? $ENTITY Wouldn't ya rather regret it after buying it instead of regret not buying it?... Er, $ENTITY I mean, there's nothin' here that you'd regret buying! Trust me! Ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY 's on the level!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Ya can't really judge our products on their brand names but rather whether they're great pieces of art. $ENTITY Instead of tryin' to decide if it's real or not,... it's more important to decide if ya really like it or not.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Very rarely, $ENTITY I get customers askin' me the question $ENTITY "Is this real?"... Boy, I'll tell ya, I can't shake my head strongly enough at notions like that. $ENTITY After all, when it comes to artwork, ya gotta choose it based on how ya FEEL, not how it LOOKS.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY So what do ya think? $ENTITY The prices are impressive, yeah? Don't ya feel like it's time to get a little cultured? $ENTITY It does a body good to live in an environment full of art, ya know?
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY So, cousin, what do ya think? $ENTITY Wouldn't ya like to order your very own piece of class?... Yup, a bit of swank in your house $ENTITY may do wonders for your longevity and social life.
NPC Tunekichi If you're interested in a piece, ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY will mail it to ya after the exhibit is over for the day. But if your mailbox is full, ya might be waiting longer, so ya gotta be real careful about that sorta thing.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Findin' just the right bargain is somethin' really special. $ENTITY It's not for the faint of heart... . $ENTITY Some of my customers are so dedicated that they come from far away to check out my stuff. $ENTITY Without the loyalists, true friends through and through, where would ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY be? Penniless and broken!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Cousin, you're all right, ya know that? Just look how far you've come to keep ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY in aprons. Never you worry, because I'm sure I'll return the favor someday. Maybe even with a visit to your hometown! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi What d'ya think?... Ya couldn't find better art if ya tried to make it yourself, am I right? $ENTITY Next time I'm in your neck of the woods, $ENTITY I'll bring only the best,... so you'd better get your Bells ready!
NPC Tunekichi I started out like any gentleman with a humble, fair-priced furniture shop, but now I'm on to art! $ENTITY It's all thanks to customer support from friends and loyalists like you and your kin! $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY thanks ya! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi The art on display is as rare and valuable as it comes, so keep your paws off the merchandise. $ENTITY Instead, ya can press left or right on to see the back of it, or you can zoom in for a closer look!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Well, cuz, you've got good taste... Such a great piece of fine art here... Displayin' this in your home $ENTITY is sure to make ya both the happiest and classiest individual in town! $ENTITY I'd send it home with ya right away, but it's only fair to have ya wait until the exhibition tent closes.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY That $ENTITY was bought by $ENTITY . That's one of my cousins from here in town. $ENTITY It's amazing being able to spot a piece with that much pomp and circumstance. $ENTITY It must be a gift... .
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY That $ENTITY was bought by $ENTITY from out in $ENTITY a few towns over. $ENTITY You see what sort of devotion folks have for ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY 's business? $ENTITY That's the quality speakin' there... .
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You like that one there, do ya?... Well, $ENTITY I guess anybody would like that $ENTITY , huh? But sorry, friend. Items are limited to one per customer per visit, $ENTITY so you're just outta luck for the day.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY Ya seem to be really close to that ... only the biggest suckers walk away from a one-in-a-lifetime bargain like this! $ENTITY I dare ya to say no to somethin' this nice at a price as crazy as $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY ! Straight up dare!... I'll take it! OK, no.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY I see you've got eyes only for that $ENTITY there! I'd say it has eyes for you too! $ENTITY I must say, $ENTITY I'm sellin' it for just $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY this time and this time only... . $ENTITY What d'ya think? $ENTITY I'll take it! I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Oh ho!... Am I mistaken? $ENTITY Because I see ya lookin' pretty close at that $ENTITY right there!... Well,... I would be too, if I were you.... Art fanatics like us, we can spot a true gem a mile away. Maybe two! $ENTITY You're in luck, cuz. Nobody's got to this one yet, so I'm still able to give ya a bargain at $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Boy, $ENTITY what would I do if I sold it for a loss? $ENTITY That's CRAZY. How can that be good business sense? $ENTITY I'll take it! Changed my mind.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Uh-oh... You're interested in that $ENTITY it's impossible to mask the raw intrigue that surrounds such a piece,... you're the first to get to it, makin' ya rather fortunate! $ENTITY Just 'cause I like ya, I'll sell it for a low, low price of $ENTITY Bells... I'll take it! No, I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Well, look at that! $ENTITY You've noticed that ... You're the kinda buyer who saves the best for last, aren't ya? ... Well, that's my fault, since I have no choice but to give in now that you found this amazin' piece. $ENTITY Truth be told, paw to heart, $ENTITY I'm sellin' it for the unbeatable price of $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY today only! I can assure ya, $ENTITY you'll never have another chance like this one... What d'ya think? $ENTITY It's mine! I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Ya pullin' my leg?! $ENTITY What a shame... .! $ENTITY There's no guarantee you'll get another chance like this, $ENTITY no, sir! $ENTITY 
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Aha! I knew that's what you'd say!... Wait. $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Ya don't have enough money for it! $ENTITY Ya tryin' to pull a fast one on ol' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY ?! Come on! $ENTITY Stop with the bad jokes!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY Whoa! Really?! $ENTITY What a shock!... Well, obviously you'd have to be as CRAZY as me to pass it up! Lemme just get that sweet, sweet payment, and we'll be all set!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY Got it! $ENTITY Well then, $ENTITY I'll mark this $ENTITY as a sold item! Everyone else is outta luck!
NPC Tunekichi Don't ya worryI'll wrap this up nice and safe and mail it to ya as soon as this exhibit is over! But remember, if your mailbox is full, it won't get delivered. So make sure you've got the space ready!
NPC Tunekichi $ENTITY The $ENTITY was bought by $ENTITY , hailin' clear from $ENTITY ! ... #x0; came all the way to THIS town to buy it! $ENTITY Now THAT is the sign of a true fine-art connoisseur... .
