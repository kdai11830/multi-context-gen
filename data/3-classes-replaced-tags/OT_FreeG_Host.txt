OT FreeG Host $ENTITY I'm so curious to meet your company from out of town, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Stop by if you can!
OT FreeG Host $ENTITY I'd love to meet your company if you have a little extra time.... Stop by my place, $ENTITY OK?... !
OT FreeG Host $ENTITY I'm always excited to help show off $ENTITY for visitors, $ENTITY so don't be shy about introducing me.
OT FreeG Host $ENTITY When it's time for your friends to go home, $ENTITY just press $ENTITY START $ENTITY and $ENTITY end the multiplayer session $ENTITY . Of course, $ENTITY it's polite to give your friends a heads-up before doing that, $ENTITY or it can be... confusing.
