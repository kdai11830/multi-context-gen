But my hometown is famous for the $ENTITY so you can eat them, $ENTITY sell them, $ENTITY plant them, $ENTITY or do whatever you'd like! By the way, if you sell them, you'll get more Bells than when you sell a regular old ... I hear there are people who grow a lot of rare fruits like these in order to make a nice living for themselves. ... why not give it a try?... If you have a $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY , it's actually quite easy to plant and grow them.

NPC Secretary Advice Ah! $ENTITY Right,... I said I'd teach you how to plant trees. $ENTITY Well...
NPC Secretary Advice Since you're carrying a shovel, $ENTITY I'll give you some pointers on raising fruit trees! $ENTITY First, use your shovel to dig a hole where you'd like to plant your tree. $ENTITY Then, $ENTITY select the fruit you want to plant from your pockets and choose $ENTITY Bury $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's quite simple! ... However, there are things you can do to make sure your tree grows nice and strong. For example, where you plant it will make a huge difference... Somewhere like in the shadow of a building or too close to another tree or next to a river or next to a cliff... If you plant in places like those, the tree won't grow up strong. $ENTITY It'll just end up wilting! $ENTITY So when you choose a place to plant a tree, $ENTITY make sure you give it plenty of space to grow!

NPC Secretary Advice $ENTITY Of course. $ENTITY Leave it to me! $ENTITY Have you ever been walking around outside and noticed a mark $ENTITY on the ground? $ENTITY That mark means something's buried there that can be dug up with your shovel. Sometimes, you might even be lucky and find a $ENTITY fossil... However, $ENTITY amateurs like us $ENTITY can't tell what kind of fossil it is or its value just by looking at it. $ENTITY But never fear! $ENTITY At the edge of the shopping district is a $ENTITY museum $ENTITY . If you take your fossils there, they'll be assessed for free! If you donate them to the museum,... we'll have a better collection in our museum for everyone to see. I'm sure the museum curator, $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY , will be delighted as well! $ENTITY You can also take assessed fossils $ENTITY to $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY and sell them for a fair amount of Bells. $ENTITY As a staff member of the town hall, I love seeing the museum develop as a result of donations... . $ENTITY But feel free to do whatever works best for you, $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary Advice $ENTITY I'm glad to hear that! $ENTITY Please use your shovel to dig up all sorts of things! $ENTITY I can't think of anything else I need to tell you about shovels, $ENTITY so let me think of some other advice to give. $ENTITY Hmmm...
