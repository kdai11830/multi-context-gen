KO Sp Cafe I get the feeling that time flows differently here! $ENTITY It's really relaxing.
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY Is it already Friday?... This week just passed by in the blink of an eye!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like to just sip my delicious coffee while planning out my weekend... I've never had it go according to plan, though! $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like to get up a little late and while the day away while drinking $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's awesome coffee... . $ENTITY I think I need to come up with a more productive way to spend my Sundays, huh?
KO Sp Cafe I'm not a morning person, so $ENTITY I can't get through my day without a cup of $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's coffee... So sleepy... .
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I swear I'm not slacking off! $ENTITY It's just a pain to get back up after I've had a break and some coffee!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I have a lot of stuff I still need to do, but first I need to take a bit of a coffee break,... !
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY You think I won't be able to sleep if I drink a cup of coffee now? $ENTITY Heh. $ENTITY I'll be just fine!... I've even fallen asleep while DRINKING coffee! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO Sp Cafe This caf will throw you out if you fall asleep, so $ENTITY it's a battle of wills while gulping down coffee! $ENTITY Probably be better if I just went home and slept, but... who does that, honestly? $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY The best coffee beans are the $ENTITY Blue Mountain $ENTITY ones! $ENTITY The balance of flavor and richness is perfect!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY The only coffee beans for me are the $ENTITY mocha $ENTITY ones! $ENTITY They've got a great name!... Mocha!... See? $ENTITY It's short and easy to say!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY Real men drink $ENTITY Kilimanjaro... The high acidity and bitterness $ENTITY make for a cup with some impact!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY If I have a cup of coffee, $ENTITY I go with the $ENTITY blend $ENTITY ! You've gotta! $ENTITY The house blend is like the front of a store.... It's the way you tell if the business is doing well or not!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I love to put in $ENTITY tons $ENTITY of milk! $ENTITY The flavor gets super mellow!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I think coffee is best with just the $ENTITY regular $ENTITY amount of milk!... You can't have too much or too little!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I only like a $ENTITY touch $ENTITY of milk!... I think using it as a hidden ingredient helps bring out the real coffee flavor!
KO Sp Cafe You $ENTITY can't $ENTITY put milk in coffee!... It'll mess with the true flavor!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY What's so wrong with putting $ENTITY 3 $ENTITY sugars in my coffee?! $ENTITY A sweet cup of coffee helps refresh a tired mind and body! Let me have my sweet coffee! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY It's gotta be ... sugars, right? $ENTITY Everything in moderation! That's the secret!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like to go light on the sugar with just ... spoon!... It's all I need to add a hint of sweetness!
KO Sp Cafe $ENTITY I don't need $ENTITY no $ENTITY stinkin' sugar!... What makes coffee COFFEE is the bitterness, don't you agree?
KO Sp Cafe What I like best about $ENTITY Brewster... is that he doesn't get too friendly, $ENTITY even if you're a regular! $ENTITY That makes it easy to enjoy a long, relaxing time all by yourself! $ENTITY Sometimes I just need my space!
KO Sp Cafe You'll bug other people if you carry on a loud conversation, $ENTITY so make sure you keep it down! $ENTITY And do your studying at home! Ain't nobody ever learned nothing studying in a coffee shop!
KO Sp Cafe I hear that $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY changes the way he prepares the coffee to match each individual's preferences. $ENTITY He's not your average Joe! And this ain't your average cuppa joe, either! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
