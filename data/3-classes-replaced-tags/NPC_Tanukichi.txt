If you're interested, please let me know at any time, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Thanks much for paying off all of your home-renovation loan! Yes, yes, thanks much, indeed! $ENTITY Perhaps you paid it off because... you're dissatisfied with your space limitations, hm? $ENTITY No need to worry! No need at all.... I can assist with the enlarging of your house, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Let's chat about the details when you've got some time on your busy hands, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY My, you've done it! $ENTITY Your home- renovation loan has been paid in full! Thanks much! Yes, yes! $ENTITY And your reason for taking care of your financial obligation is... your home is not $ENTITY big enough, hm? $ENTITY Yes, yes, I understand completely,... ! I can help you build the home of your very large dreams! $ENTITY When you wish to discuss the details further, please come find me!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes, yes! $ENTITY You've paid off every bit of your home-renovation loan! $ENTITY I'm quite conservative in matters of finance, but I knew you'd take care of this, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY My faith was such that I drew up plans for more additions after you added a second floor, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'm confident you'll be quite pleased with these plans. $ENTITY I do hope you'll give them some thought, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Oh, happy day! $ENTITY You've paid off all your home-renovation loan! $ENTITY And your reason for being so very, very diligent is... No need for words.

I cannot overstate how incredible this accomplishment is! $ENTITY Truly, $ENTITY it is something remarkable! Yes, yes! $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY I believe you deserve a reward of sorts. $ENTITY No, no, no such discounts from me, $ENTITY but, hm... $ENTITY Yes! An old song from the Nook family lineage, $ENTITY sung in times of great success to strengthen hearts! $ENTITY Ahem ... #xE; GL- ... KEEEH! FST! FST! RrrrrrrrrrrrKLAGH! CH- $ENTITY ch-ch-mmmMMMmmm! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it is very old $ENTITY and in the language of my ancestors, $ENTITY which happens to be Raccoonish, yes, yes. $ENTITY Anyway, your home may be at a state of basic completion, $ENTITY but it is far from being done, hm? $ENTITY I do hope you'll continue to improve your home's interior and exterior, yes, yes! $ENTITY I do! $ENTITY If you're in need of advice, please let $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY or me know, yes? $ENTITY We'll be quite glad to help you out. $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY right away, as I'm sure $ENTITY he'll want to congratulate you as well. $ENTITY Yes, yes! Your continued patronage $ENTITY of $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY is very much appreciated. Do come again!
NPC Tanukichi Your home has now been built, yes? $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Your house is now the stuff of dreams, hm? ... And now the numbers... . ... I deducted your down payment, leaving a grand total of... . $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY . That's the total amount of your paltry little loan. A mere trifle, really, yes? $ENTITY Hm? $ENTITY Oh, no, you don't pay me directly. $ENTITY Please make all of your payments at the $ENTITY post office ABD $ENTITY . And there's no set schedule, either. Pay the loan off at your own pace or whenever you're able, hm?
NPC Tanukichi ... one more thing... We do require that all homeowners become members of the $ENTITY Happy Home Academy $ENTITY , hm? They'll just stop by from time to time and give your home an in-depth inspection. $ENTITY Very good to get one. $ENTITY The inspection is a comprehensive look at your room and furniture layout, your hygiene level, et cetera. $ENTITY If you're given high marks, you might even receive a wonderfully elegant commemorative prize! $ENTITY They'll schedule the inspection, so there's nothing for you to worry about. $ENTITY No worries at all, hm? What else... Members, you see, also gain access to the $ENTITY HH Showcase $ENTITY behind the shopping district. $ENTITY Once you've received a letter that confirms your membership, you may visit the showcase at any time! $ENTITY Very good. Please do come see me if you wish to discuss further renovations, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY How may I help you? $ENTITY Down payment! Never mind.
NPC Tanukichi Hm? That so?... No problem! When you've got your down payment, please do bring it to me here, yes!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You've brought the money?... Ah, we Nooks can sense Bells, yes, yes. $ENTITY Old family secret. $ENTITY Now let's just... hm?... But, but, ... You do not have enough! $ENTITY Not nearly! $ENTITY I need the full $ENTITY 10,000-Bell $ENTITY down payment in one lump sum, yes? $ENTITY Living in a tent cannot be terribly comfortable, no, no.... Wouldn't you prefer a nice warm house, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You brought the money? $ENTITY Let's have us a look, hm? $ENTITY Yes! Yes! $ENTITY Exactly $ENTITY 10,000 Bells $ENTITY ! That does make me rather happy.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Very good, very good! $ENTITY The money makes everything official, and work on your house can begin at once. $ENTITY You can also choose the color of your newly built home's roof. So what color $ENTITY will it be, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! Got it! $ENTITY I will make sure your house is ready to go by tomorrow morning. $ENTITY What else... . to tell you... Oh, yes, yes, of course!... I must tell you all about home remodeling! $ENTITY Once your house is finished, I can help you $ENTITY update the exterior...

Well, for the moment you must be looking forward to tomorrow, yes? $ENTITY Thanks much!
NPC Tanukichi I'm so sorry! I don't have the right permits to work on homes in towns other than this one. However, if there are any items here you would like, $ENTITY please let me know, yes? $ENTITY I can contact the realtor in your town and request a single item at a time be made available there too!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Your request will be made available to you right away. I only have to make a few quick phone calls, hm? $ENTITY When you arrive home, be sure to visit your realtor before it closes for the day, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY You would like to discuss $ENTITY your home, hm? $ENTITY I wanna expand! Never mind.
NPC Tanukichi Oh, really? $ENTITY If you have any housing questions, do come see me at any time, hm?
NPC Tanukichi I am truly very sorry, but until your existing loan is paid in full I can accept no new renovation requests. $ENTITY You can pay your loan 24 hours a day at the $ENTITY ABD in the post office... Once it's all paid off, come talk to me again, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Hmm... ? It is time to make your home bigger, yes, yes. $ENTITY A loan of $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY can make this dream a reality. $ENTITY Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY I've been thinking... You know, your home would be better if it were just a bit bigger, yes, yes. $ENTITY For a piddling $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY , I can make such a thing happen. $ENTITY Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Well... listen, $ENTITY , I believe your home would be oh so cozy if it had a second floor. A smallish loan of $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY would be required of course. $ENTITY Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Hmm... , wouldn't your house benefit greatly from an addition of some sort? $ENTITY In my own expert opinion, I would suggest the following... What do you think, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Let's see... , your home would be improved much with just a bit more space, yes, yes. $ENTITY And if you decided to expand, may I suggest... 
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Hmm... . $ENTITY I must say, $ENTITY , your home needs more space or perhaps maybe an extra room, hm? $ENTITY I could of course help with whatever you'd like to do. What do you think? $ENTITY Extra room! More space! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! So tell me, $ENTITY where do you want the additional room, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Excellent! So tell me, $ENTITY which room shall we make larger, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY The new room will be added to the left side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY The new room will be added to the right side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY The new room will be added to the back side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes, a basement is what you want, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You want to widen the room on the left side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You want to widen the room on the right side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You want to widen the room on the back side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You want to widen the basement, do you, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY You want to widen the room on the second floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi Your loan will come to a total of $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY . $ENTITY This is perfectly acceptable, yes? $ENTITY Let's do it! Um, never mind.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Excellent! $ENTITY I will put your order in right away, hm? $ENTITY The work will be fully completed by tomorrow morning. I'm so sure you must be very excited, yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY How do you like your current living arrangements? $ENTITY I'm always here for exterior-renovation consultation!
NPC Tanukichi I'm terribly sorry, $ENTITY , but your house cannot be made any larger. It's simply not possible. $ENTITY However, there are changes you can make to the exterior. I recommend you consider your options, hm?
NPC Tanukichi I'm very sorry, but I do not offer loans for exterior renovations, hm? $ENTITY But, $ENTITY ! Compared to your previous home loans, $ENTITY the price is nothing but a drop in the bucket!

NPC Tanukichi Your renovations $ENTITY are complete, yes? $ENTITY It may be but a small change, but I trust you are pleased, hm?
NPC Tanukichi Your house $ENTITY is much roomier, yes?... I hope you find it adds to your quality of life, my friend! Yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Your home is now a magnificent two stories high, hm? $ENTITY With an additional floor, you have much space to fill, $ENTITY and I'm sure it will bring you joy to fill it, yes, yes! $ENTITY 
NPC Tanukichi Your addition $ENTITY is finished, hm?... Oh, $ENTITY , my friend, your home is that much homier now. Yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi Did you $ENTITY look around your house?... I daresay you'll not find many that equal such fine workmanship, hm?

NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Much thanks in advance, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY And, $ENTITY , by the wayyour house is as large as we can make it. We cannot build it any larger. $ENTITY I trust this new information is all perfectly clear, hm? $ENTITY Thanks much!

NPC Tanukichi That $ENTITY is a sample used for door renovations.

NPC Tanukichi That $ENTITY is a sample used for exterior renovations. If you make the order, we can then renovate your house, just like the model shows!

NPC Tanukichi That $ENTITY is an excellent sample used for exterior aesthetic changes, hm? $ENTITY Make your house bigger, $ENTITY , and then we can make large-scale renovations as well! $ENTITY Yes, yes!

NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY , hm?... If memory serves, $ENTITY , you have the same roof on your house.

NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Thanks much! $ENTITY I will help make all of the necessary arrangements, and... $ENTITY everything will be completed tomorrow! Exciting!
NPC Tanukichi Hm. $ENTITY . But you do not live in this town, so $ENTITY I cannot accept your order, no. I can contact the realtor in your town $ENTITY and arrange for the item to be available there. $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Yes, please! No, thank you.
NPC Tanukichi Yes, $ENTITY . But I can only contact your town about a single item at a time. I can, however, make a request that this item replace the item we talked about earlier. $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Yes, please! No, thank you.
NPC Tanukichi Very well, I understand.... Please do not hesitate $ENTITY to tell me if there's anything you wish to request.
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Understood. I'll arrange for the item to be available in your town's real- estate office when you return home. $ENTITY Once you arrive, please do stop by your realtor before they close for the day, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Very good! I will cancel your prior request and see to it that this item is sent to your realtor instead!
NPC Tanukichi That $ENTITY is a sample used for exterior renovations, yes? $ENTITY This is but one way owners of large homes can change their style in just a snap!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Oh, that's right. $ENTITY You were busy with your shopping, were you not?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY I have, of course, completed running the numbers on your home loan, $ENTITY , yes, yes. $ENTITY Now let us discuss the cost... You know, $ENTITY , we can't build you a house unless you have all necessary costs covered, hm? $ENTITY So the down payment is nothing more than a paltry $ENTITY 10,000 Bells... Let's do it! I can't afford that!
NPC Tanukichi Very good! $ENTITY Though, $ENTITY we can't break ground on your home until your down payment is received, hm?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY No, no?!... That's fine! $ENTITY You're fine! $ENTITY You needn't worry about giving me a single Bell at this point in time! $ENTITY I'm quite a generous raccoon! $ENTITY My heart is about the size of a four- bedroom, two-bath duplex, hm? $ENTITY That being said... . I do need your down payment before any work can be done on your home. OK?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY But do not worry! $ENTITY No, no!... This town is rich in crops and other resources. You'll find it easy to earn money! $ENTITY You can collect $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY and $ENTITY seashells $ENTITY and take them to the $ENTITY recycling shop $ENTITY to earn quick cash, yes? $ENTITY Once you've saved a bit, buying a $ENTITY net $ENTITY or $ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY at the $ENTITY store $ENTITY is a good idea as well. It is indeed! $ENTITY You can use such tools to go forth and catch $ENTITY insects $ENTITY and $ENTITY fish $ENTITY to sell too. An easy path to riches, hm? $ENTITY Much faster than searching for low-paying, part-time employment, yes? $ENTITY Oh yes, yes! $ENTITY So come and see me right away $ENTITY 10,000 Bells... Good luck, good luck!
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY Oh!... , yes, yes, welcome!... Have you finished $ENTITY everything you needed to do to move in?
NPC Tanukichi $ENTITY So you would like $ENTITY Yes, yes! Hold it!
