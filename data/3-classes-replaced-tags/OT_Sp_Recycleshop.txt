OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY There isn't a single thing for sale today? $ENTITY And here I was, ready to go on a shopping spree. $ENTITY Too bad!
OT Sp Recycleshop Absolutely nothing for sale today?... I can't believe I wasted my time coming here!
OT Sp Recycleshop Don't tell me... still nothing in stock? $ENTITY And there's no refund for the time I've wasted today. $ENTITY Hmph!
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Only one item left... I think that makes it a collectible! $ENTITY If you don't buy it, $ENTITY I probably will.
OT Sp Recycleshop Ooh... only one item left in stock today. $ENTITY ! I think this means I'm destined to buy it! $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY calm down,... . $ENTITY Think about what you're buying for a moment. $ENTITY Do you really need it?

OT Sp Recycleshop All right, $ENTITY the shelves are stocked.... Time to get down to some serious shopping. $ENTITY !
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY The wildest shopping spree begins with a single purchase. $ENTITY The only question is... where will it end?

OT Sp Recycleshop Wow,... there's a lot to choose from today. $ENTITY And I can't afford to buy everything. $ENTITY What a shame!
OT Sp Recycleshop Do you ever feel overwhelmed by a selection like this,... ? $ENTITY Me either! $ENTITY Bring on the bargains!
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY I don't like to think of the things I buy here as "used." $ENTITY It's more like everyone else was just borrowing them $ENTITY until I was ready to take possession of my favorites.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY If you came here to sell something, $ENTITY I hope it doesn't have sentimental value. $ENTITY It's sad to think about other people trading in their memories for a few Bells.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY You know that old saying? $ENTITY "You get what you pay for." $ENTITY Well... it's not always true in this shop. $ENTITY That's because anyone can list an item for sale, $ENTITY and they can choose whatever price they want. You can find some good bargains, $ENTITY but remember that other old saying: $ENTITY "Buyer beware!"
OT Sp Recycleshop I just love finding a hidden treasure in a secondhand shop like this. $ENTITY It's so exciting.... !
OT Sp Recycleshop Wanna know what cheers me up when I'm feeling blue? $ENTITY It's called retail therapy.

OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I appreciate your honesty,... . But... I question your salesmanship! $ENTITY !
OT Sp Recycleshop You're very persuasive, ... but I think I need to pass. $ENTITY I can't spend that much right now.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY When I was younger I wouldn't have batted an eye at this price. $ENTITY Now I know there are better deals. $ENTITY Sorry!
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY You must think I'm pretty gullible,... . $ENTITY Your item is way overpriced, $ENTITY and you know it!
OT Sp Recycleshop All right, $ENTITY you sold me. $ENTITY I can't wait to add your item to my collection!
OT Sp Recycleshop I was on the fence, $ENTITY but you just convinced me, ... Have you considered a job in sales?
OT Sp Recycleshop You know what? $ENTITY You're right. $ENTITY I DO deserve something this nice! $ENTITY Even if it's a little expensive. After all $ENTITY , it's not often you find exactly what you're looking for.... Oh, $ENTITY ! I'm excited!

OT Sp Recycleshop Well, $ENTITY all right! $ENTITY I'll add ... to my collection. Thanks, $ENTITY !
OT Sp Recycleshop I don't know... I could really use $ENTITY , $ENTITY but that's a lot of Bells to spend... 
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY I definitely didn't plan on spending $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY today... But $ENTITY I desperately need ... , what should I do?
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY I can't decide whether or not to buy ... What do you think,... You should buy it! Save your Bells.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Aww, $ENTITY thanks for being the voice of reason. $ENTITY If you hadn't been here, $ENTITY I might have bought two of them! But you're right... I should save my hard-earned Bells for more important things.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Are you sure? $ENTITY You're not in cahoots with the seller or anything? $ENTITY You really think it's a good deal? $ENTITY Just kidding,... ! I totally agree with you... I'm buying!... !
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Hmm... This price is almost too good to be true. $ENTITY I wonder if there's been a mistake... Great dealbuy now! Better think twice.
OT Sp Recycleshop $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY you're right. $ENTITY This is either a mistake... or there's something wrong with the item. $ENTITY I'll pass.
