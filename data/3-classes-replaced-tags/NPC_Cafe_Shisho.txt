NPC Cafe Shisho The $ENTITY mocha $ENTITY coffee $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY makes is a huge hit with me! $ENTITY I wish I had a JOKE... that was always a hit. Maybe someday... .

NPC Cafe Shisho I actually have a bad sweet tooth, so when I drink coffee, $ENTITY I always ask for $ENTITY 2 $ENTITY spoonfuls $ENTITY of sugar. $ENTITY I had my share of bitter experiences back when I told jokes for a living... .

NPC Cafe Shisho I've gotten completely in the habit of drinking a cup of coffee to wake up $ENTITY before my busy afternoon. $ENTITY My club may be open for business at night, but I have to clean up the place beforehand, you know? $ENTITY Oddly, I think I work harder now than I did back when I was still a full-time comedian... .
NPC Cafe Shisho Have you ever seen those gyroids up on the stage at the club? $ENTITY It's weird, but I didn't actually put them there. $ENTITY They just appeared out of the blue one day. How bizarre! $ENTITY And weirder still, I get the feeling that someone is switching them out from time to time... .

NPC Cafe Shisho You know, I was only able to open my club thanks to all the support you gave me, Mayor $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Every day since the club opened, $ENTITY my family says a quick thank-you to you and $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY at breakfast!

NPC Cafe Shisho Back when I was a comedian, $ENTITY I'd often spend all night sipping coffee and thinking up new gags in a caf.
NPC Cafe Shisho You know, the other day when $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY came in, $ENTITY he was holding a takeout cup from here. I've never run into him here, but I'm guessing he's also a regular?
NPC Cafe Shisho Speaking of coffee, back in the day, I often thought to myself, $ENTITY "I want to tell a joke so funny, it makes the audience spit out their coffee!" ... You know? I was never able to do that. $ENTITY There were times they got mad and chased after me, though... .
NPC Cafe Shisho I had a teacher who taught me the comedy ropes. Every single one. $ENTITY He's an amazing person who was known in the entertainment world as a master of laughs. $ENTITY It was always my dream to make it big just like him and have people say I surpassed him, but... . $ENTITY I retired long before that dream came true.... Hmmm? $ENTITY You're curious what my old teacher $ENTITY Frillard $ENTITY is up to now? $ENTITY He's been retired for ages, but he's just as spry as ever! $ENTITY I don't think I'll ever get the best of him!
NPC Cafe Shisho I never quite became popular on a national level, but I still had some fairly passionate fans. Even though I've retired, they still stop by the club before it opens to see how I'm doing... . Sometimes they even bring me treats, so I'm always so grateful for their continued support. When I tell them one of my old jokes and they smile, $ENTITY it takes me back to my days as a comedian. $ENTITY Heh. I... don't get a chance to look back fondly very often... .
NPC Cafe Shisho You know, lately I've had a lot of youngsters pop into the club before it's open while I'm still cleaning... "I need to take a picture for my $ENTITY TPC $ENTITY , so teach me a funny face!" $ENTITY I hear that's popular at the moment. $ENTITY Having a funny face on your TPC... I really don't get kids these days.
