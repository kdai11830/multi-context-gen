OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... Can you feel the magic in the air?... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Tonight... I'm going to get to the bottom of this whole "Santa Claus" thing... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY , ... Let's get this party started. $ENTITY Ho ho ho!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's finally $ENTITY Toy Day... Abandon hope all ye who expected to get more than an hour of sleep.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Ahh... snow as far as the eye can see. $ENTITY What a perfect setting for $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's impossible to be in a bad mood when there's snow on the ground and everything is this beautiful. $ENTITY Believe meI've tried!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I just KNEW we'd get a white $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY this year. $ENTITY Uh-oh. $ENTITY At the rate it's snowing, $ENTITY we might get a white New Year's too... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Now THIS is what I like to see! $ENTITY A blanket of fresh snow for $ENTITY Toy Day... I hope it snows like this forever! $ENTITY On second thought, $ENTITY it should stop snowing in March, $ENTITY and then be sunny every day until October. $ENTITY Perfect!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY If it's silly to get excited about $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY as an adult, $ENTITY then I don't want to be... uh... not silly. $ENTITY , $ENTITY that was a terrible analogy, $ENTITY but who cares? $ENTITY It's Toy Day!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I'm glad it's cold outside, because I'm burning up with $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY fever! $ENTITY Symptoms include smiling, $ENTITY hugging, $ENTITY and random proclamations of excitement. $ENTITY !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Yay! $ENTITY It's a white $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ! $ENTITY The snow is so pure and fresh looking. $ENTITY I can't wait to mess it all up!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY , $ENTITY it's a little brisk out here to be wearing this outfit... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY All this snow reminds me of my favorite $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ever. $ENTITY It was that one year when it also snowed. $ENTITY I never said it was a great story.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Look! $ENTITY Fresh snow, $ENTITY just in time for $ENTITY Toy Day... Isn't $ENTITY beautiful like this?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's so romantic out here with all the snow and festive lights.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I just came out to peek at the snow without realizing I was walking into the mother of all blizzards! $ENTITY Brrrrr!
OT Ev Xmas A white $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY is one thing, $ENTITY but this is like a whiteOUT $ENTITY Toy Day... How will $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY deliver his presents?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's getting late, and $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY still hasn't handed out gifts. $ENTITY Ugh, $ENTITY how much longer is this wonderful holiday going to last?... This $ENTITY needs her sleep!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Isn't it about time for $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY to pass out gifts? $ENTITY I hope he doesn't forget!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY That old fellow in red always keeps us waiting, $ENTITY doesn't he? $ENTITY I'm talking about the pizza-delivery guy, $ENTITY Steve.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY , $ENTITY is that you? $ENTITY Why are you dressed up like Santa? $ENTITY Do you have a gift for me or something?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY That's quite an outfit, ... I hope you're prepared to hand out some gifts... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Wait. Is that... , $ENTITY you almost fooled me. $ENTITY Your punishment for trying to fool me is that you owe me a present. $ENTITY Kidding! $ENTITY Or am I?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY So sleepy... Must stay awake... for $ENTITY Jingle... zzzzzzzzz!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Zzzz... huh? $ENTITY Was I asleep? $ENTITY Did I miss $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ? $ENTITY NOOOOOOO! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY #x4;Jingle $ENTITY hasn't handed out gifts yet. $ENTITY Be cool,... .
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I must be tired, $ENTITY because for a second there I thought you were Santa!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa? $ENTITY I was expecting $ENTITY Jingle... Wait a second... Is that you,... Why would you dress up like Santa and try to fool me?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Guess what just happened. $ENTITY Santa showed up and brought me exactly what I wanted! $ENTITY The weird thing is I didn't even write him or put out a wish list.... How did he know what to get? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess that's why he got the job as Santa.... !
OT Ev Xmas ... Santa just gave me the best present! $ENTITY How did he know exactly what I wanted? $ENTITY He's either psychic or he's been reading my diary. $ENTITY Either way, $ENTITY I don't care. $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev Xmas OK, $ENTITY this might seem like a weird question, $ENTITY but are you actually Santa? $ENTITY Hear me out. $ENTITY Who else could know exactly what I wanted? $ENTITY You're the only person I told! $ENTITY You don't seem old enough to be Santa... Maybe you just told him what I wanted and he picked it up. Well, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Santa or not, $ENTITY thank you so much!
OT Ev Xmas Well, $ENTITY I just opened my gift from Santa... It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. $ENTITY I knew I should have sent him a letter $ENTITY or left out some cookies $ENTITY or something!
OT Ev Xmas Hey, ... Did you get your gift from Santa yet? $ENTITY It's the thought that counts, $ENTITY but I don't know WHAT Santa was thinking!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the good news is that Santa just visited! $ENTITY The bad news is that I wasn't completely satisfied with my gift. $ENTITY What am I going to do, $ENTITY go all the way to the North Pole to return it?... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Hi, Santa! $ENTITY How exciting to see you! $ENTITY Hey,... Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer was looking for you... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Hey, Santa!... You know, $ENTITY I just saw one of your reindeer. I think it was $ENTITY Jingle... #xE;Anyway, $ENTITY he seemed a little nervous. $ENTITY You might want to go check on him!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY , $ENTITY have you seen $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer yet? $ENTITY I know he's around here somewhere... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I've got good news... Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer has arrived in ... And some bad news: $ENTITY he only had one sack of gifts. $ENTITY How could he fit everything I want in there?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY look at you, $ENTITY . All in red, $ENTITY just like the man from the North Pole himself. $ENTITY You are trying to dress like Santa, $ENTITY right?... Or do you just really like red?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa, $ENTITY is that you? $ENTITY Let me take a closer look.... ? $ENTITY What are you doing in Santa's clothes? $ENTITY I don't want to see Santa running around $ENTITY in his long johns, $ENTITY so you better give his clothes back!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa?... It's too early for Santa. $ENTITY Who are you trying to fool, $ENTITY ?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I'll always cherish the present you gave me this year, $ENTITY Santa.... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thanks for the great present this year, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY , $ENTITY that outfit is really impressive in person.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY You seem awfully familiar somehow. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY thanks for the present.... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY it's Santa! $ENTITY But... where's your sack of toys? $ENTITY I hope you didn't forget it back at the North Pole. $ENTITY You had one job!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Maybe you're not the real Santa. $ENTITY Maybe you're one of those "helpers" my parents used to talk about... I think the REAL Santa would have his toy sack with him at all times... 
OT Ev Xmas Santa, $ENTITY what happened to your sack of toys? $ENTITY If you don't have presents to hand out to people, $ENTITY then what are you going to do in $ENTITY tonight?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Yay, $ENTITY you're finally here! $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... Here's your present! Uh...happy Toy Day?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY , Santa! Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... Here's your present! Uh...happy Toy Day?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY Santa, $ENTITY is that really you?... Well, $ENTITY happy $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY to you, $ENTITY sir! $ENTITY Here's your present! Uh...happy Toy Day?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa... is that you? $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY I was half asleep. $ENTITY Or maybe three-quarters asleep.... Here's your present! Uh...happy Toy Day?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I might act tough sometimes, $ENTITY but I'm still a little girl when it comes to $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY And little girls get what they want on Toy Day!... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY No present this year? $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY ?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Great, $ENTITY now Santa himself is teasing me!
OT Ev Xmas ... Can I open it?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I've been waiting so long! $ENTITY Can I open it right now?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Look at me. $ENTITY I'm as giddy as a little schoolgirl. $ENTITY I'm opening it right now!
OT Ev Xmas ... I mean, $ENTITY I love it. $ENTITY You shouldn't have.
OT Ev Xmas Oh... YES! $ENTITY It's just what I wanted.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh my goodness. $ENTITY Is it really ... My dream came true!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Aww, $ENTITY it's exactly what I wanted.... How thoughtful of you.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY This has been the best $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ever... thanks to you! $ENTITY Go, $ENTITY spread your cheer around the whole world. $ENTITY I'm all good!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thank you, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY Good luck with the rest of your deliveries tonight. $ENTITY People all around the world are waiting for you... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Being Santa Claus must be a pretty good gig. $ENTITY You only work one night a year! $ENTITY And the whole $ENTITY "making children's dreams come true" thing. $ENTITY That's good too.
OT Ev Xmas Ahh... now I can finally go to sleep.... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY What's this? $ENTITY Santa without a sack of toys? $ENTITY On the one day of the year when he absolutely has to deliver? $ENTITY Far be it from me to give advice to you, $ENTITY Mr. Claus, $ENTITY but you might think about checking with $ENTITY Jingle... 
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Without a sack of presents, $ENTITY you're just a person in a Santa suit, $ENTITY aren't you? $ENTITY If you were the real Santa, $ENTITY wouldn't you at least have some reindeer?
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... Santa! $ENTITY I've been patiently waiting for you... OK, here's your present. Sorry. Nothing for you.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa? $ENTITY You seem awfully familiar somehow. $ENTITY Do you have a summer job delivering pizzas? $ENTITY Ha! Here's a present. Sorry. Nothing for you.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY How many years have you been doing this? $ENTITY And you're still able to keep up with it all. $ENTITY Impressive! $ENTITY Thanks. Here you go! Sorry. Nothing for you.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY What? ... Well, $ENTITY I didn't get you anything either.
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY aren't you looking festive?... Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY someone's fired up for $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ! $ENTITY #xE;... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I have to hand it to you,... You make a pretty good Santa. $ENTITY You almost had me fooled!
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I hope you have a fun $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY in ... !
OT Ev Xmas $ENTITY I'm glad you decided to spend $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY here in $ENTITY with us.... !
