KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Anyway, you know tonight's the night for $ENTITY Tsukimi... It gets called different things all over the world, but we're sticking with "Tsukimi" forever. $ENTITY Oh well, doesn't matter! $ENTITY The moon just looks cool, and that's good enough for me!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Oh, that reminds me! $ENTITY I hear we're gonna have clear weather tonight!... Perfect for $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I suppose $ENTITY there's a certain charm when the moon $ENTITY peeks out from behind clouds, though!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Tonight's the night for $ENTITY Tsukimi... Are you one of those "dango first, moon later" types? $ENTITY I like the moon. I like the dango!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY Just what I expected from you, ... Way to stick with tradition! $ENTITY Whoever thought up the idea of looking at the moon while eating dango rice cakes was pretty smart!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY Way to be honest! $ENTITY I suppose it'd be pretty awkward if your stomach started growling while we were looking at the moon! $ENTITY Make sure you eat a big dinner! $ENTITY GAHAHA!... !
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Look at it, ... Now THAT'S a moon worth viewing! $ENTITY I wouldn't be surprised one bit if we saw a rabbit appear... Would you?! $ENTITY GAHAHA!... ! $ENTITY Get it? Because rabbits are always pounding mochi on the moon! $ENTITY What? $ENTITY They don't tell you that story where you're from? $ENTITY What do you think's up there? A man? $ENTITY Weird.
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Every year when it's time for $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY , I'm always reminded $ENTITY of how great the moon is! $ENTITY Really makes you appreciate the fact that it's not falling on our town anytime soon! Uh, incidentally, you don't have a flute or ocarina on you just in case, do you? $ENTITY Can't be too careful...
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Since I don't normally spend my time staring up at the moon, I've never noticed before, but... It's real pretty... Just like a bunch of cheese or something equally as delicious!... !

KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Hey, ... this might sound kinda odd on a night like this, but... When do you think the moon looks the best? $ENTITY During a crescent moon. During a waxing moon. During a full moon. During a waning moon. I'm not really sure.
KO FreeF MoonJPN Ouch ouch ouch... I've been looking up at the moon for so long that I've got a crick in my neck! $ENTITY But... somehow I just can't take my eyes off the moon tonight!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Seeing a moon like this makes me want to work hard! $ENTITY Hmmm? $ENTITY Why? $ENTITY Because a rabbit's gotta pound out some mochi on the night of a full moon, right? $ENTITY You see these muscles? That's from practicing just in case I needed to take over for the moon rabbit. $ENTITY Little-known fact: $ENTITY the rabbit that lives up there is my cousin! $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY We used to play as kids! $ENTITY Now he's too busy to even stop by and have a cup of tea or nothing! $ENTITY And my mom tells me,... "Why don't you do something with your life like your moon cousin is?!"... Because I'm busy, that's why! $ENTITY Sorry, got a little carried away.... But hey, don't let me stop you from enjoying the moon tonight!
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Did you hear? $ENTITY They say there's a rabbit on the moon who pounds out mochi on nights when it's full! $ENTITY I wonder why it's not something like $ENTITY instead... Oh well!... 
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Oh, a crescent moon?... I can see what you mean! $ENTITY Those curves are what people think of when they hear the word "moon"! $ENTITY Heh. Well... Hopefully that doesn't hurt the moon's feelings, since it's all full tonight!... !
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Quite the moon fan, aren't you?... You're talking about when the moon is half lit and half dark, right? $ENTITY Seeing the moon like that... so perfectly cut in half...... It almost makes me nervous! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY GAHAHA!... That's the ticket! $ENTITY The full moon is the most impactful of them all! Go big or go home, right?! $ENTITY Seeing the moon all round like that... It's like some fine cheese, and that helps me sleep well!... !
KO FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY That reminds medid you know the moon has a different name each day? $ENTITY If you want to meet the same moon you met today... you gotta wait almost a whole month! $ENTITY Moon facts!
