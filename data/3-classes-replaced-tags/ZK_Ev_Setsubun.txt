ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY the ogre has come!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Here it comes! $ENTITY It's the ogre!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I was waiting for you, $ENTITY little ogre!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Out with bad luck! $ENTITY In with the good fortune! $ENTITY Hah ha!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I've always wanted to do this... Though, to tell you the truth, $ENTITY I'm actually more interested in being the ogre, strange as that sounds.
ZK Ev Setsubun I'm sorry, ... Did that hurt at all? $ENTITY If I knew I'd feel so guilty, $ENTITY I'd have taken your place... 
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Thanks to you, $ENTITY I could throw some beans around, ... Heh. We can't have bean-throwing without the ogre, you know... 
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's the ogre!... Huh? $ENTITY Wait a minute! $ENTITY How come you also have beans?! $ENTITY You gotta decide whether it's me or you who's throwing the beans,... !
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Here it comes! $ENTITY It's the ogre!... Huh? $ENTITY How come the ogre's also carrying beans? $ENTITY You're pretty sneaky! $ENTITY You have to decide whether you'll throw them $ENTITY or have people throw them at you... 
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I was waiting for you, $ENTITY little ogre!... Huh? $ENTITY What's that? $ENTITY How come you've got beans as well? Are you stumped about $ENTITY whether you want to throw them at people or have people throw them at you... ? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you gotta pick a side!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Aahhh! $ENTITY I can't control the urge to throw some beans around here and there,... ! I wonder if there's... an ogre I can aim at.
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I wanna throw some beans around... I wish there was someone... to help me with this problem!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY We can only have $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY if we have someone we can throw the beans at! $ENTITY I wanna throw some beans around... 
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh,... What are you going to do with those beans? $ENTITY If you're gonna throw them, $ENTITY aim for the ogres, not me!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY hey... You have some beans? $ENTITY If only there was an ogre, $ENTITY things would get really lively around here really quick... .
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh, whoa, $ENTITY you have some beans!... Hey, $ENTITY don't throw those beans at me, OK? $ENTITY You gotta throw them at ogres while yelling at them!... !
ZK Ev Setsubun ... are you participating... in our bean-throwing battle?
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Heh heh heh.... , you don't seem to know what to do, huh? $ENTITY You see, $ENTITY even if you have the beans, $ENTITY we can't do anything unless we have an ogre to throw them at!
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY What a coincidence, ... You seem to have some beans, $ENTITY and I have some as well! $ENTITY All we need now is an ogre... 
ZK Ev Setsubun Are you all right? $ENTITY Sure you aren't too tired from all those beans being tossed at you? $ENTITY Don't worry!... I'm on your side.
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Just like the rumors said, $ENTITY you've got a pretty wild-looking face there!... !
ZK Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Even if we see an ogre, $ENTITY we can't go around $ENTITY throwing beans wherever! $ENTITY It's hard to clean them up...
