HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Hey, ... How come you're so desperate to be in love with a girl? $ENTITY I mean, isn't it more fun to be single and hang out with the guys? $ENTITY Guys can do cool guy stuff together!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Hah ha! $ENTITY Love is "cool guy stuff"! $ENTITY Just think of it as the world's most awesome strategy game! $ENTITY It's a game you really should try sometime, $ENTITY !
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Love is a game?! $ENTITY Did you hear this guy,... ?!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY 
HA 3P Zk ... Wahhh!... I didn't see you there! $ENTITY Please don't tell anyone about my whole "love is a game" thing! $ENTITY Please, ... I won't tell anyone. I'm telling everyone!
HA 3P Zk ... Wait! $ENTITY No!... It's not what it sounds like! $ENTITY I really have a lot of respect for true love! $ENTITY Can you just forget what I said? $ENTITY OK, I'll forget it. I'll never forget it!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Thanks, ... Thanks for being so cool about this! $ENTITY Cool guys are popular with the ladies, right? $ENTITY So being Mr. Popular, you must know a lot of girls, right? $ENTITY How about introducing me to some then, ... What do you say?

HA 3P Zk $ENTITY I can't believe it! $ENTITY That's not fair! $ENTITY How about we pretend like I was just rehearsing for a play? $ENTITY And I'm the foolish-yet-lovable scamp who learns a lesson by the end!... !
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY You... just don't understand girls, do you?
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Gah!... Thank goodness! $ENTITY came up and started yammering on and on about these new clothes he's wearing... .
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY my new threads are totally inside out! $ENTITY It's the latest thing! $ENTITY But I suppose this type of fashion innovation just goes over your head.
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Gaaaaah! Another stupid fashion trend! $ENTITY When will it end?! $ENTITY Now it's gonna be all "inside out" this and "inside out" that! $ENTITY I can't take it! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Hah ha! $ENTITY I, on the other hand, can't wait! $ENTITY This is going to be great! $ENTITY Wait a minute... Oh no! $ENTITY This isn't inside-out gear. $ENTITY It's just my regular gear inside out!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Huh. $ENTITY So that must mean... You're not part of some innovative new fashion trend!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Noooooooo! $ENTITY I'm normal! $ENTITY Oh, man. $ENTITY It's all over for me... .
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY "Normal" is a bad thing? $ENTITY You're so weird, bro... !
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Help me out, ... I'm trying to talk some sense into my bro here, ... Today's the day we're gonna get $ENTITY to train like a man!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Help, ... He's trying to completely change my image! And he thinks I'm his bro!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY What are you talking about? $ENTITY I'm only telling you that you should do some weight training!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Oh, sure! That's how it starts! $ENTITY But you're nuts about working out! $ENTITY Pretty soon you'll have me doing jimmy jacks or whatever all day!
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Oh, come on! $ENTITY Jimmy jacks? $ENTITY And, yeah, I might make you do a ton of them, but they're good for you! $ENTITY Are you saying I'm too intense with my passion for training?! $ENTITY Is that it? $ENTITY Ugh... Oh, man. $ENTITY I'm starting to doubt myself now, bro... 
HA 3P Zk $ENTITY Hey! Hey! $ENTITY Don't get down on yourself like that, ... bro. $ENTITY You're great, $ENTITY . Really! $ENTITY But even you have to admit we've talked about training way too much at this point! So, um... .yeah.... I think we're pretty much done here, $ENTITY .
