NPC Furniture ... gets the ol' " $ENTITY " design... Sure! Got it!
NPC Furniture $ENTITY Hm. So we're gonna keep ... as is then... Sure, that's fine.

NPC Furniture .... But, $ENTITY hey now! $ENTITY That means you don't wanna change a thing!... Exactly what do you wanna do? $ENTITY Start from the top. Don't change it.
NPC Furniture All right, fine! $ENTITY This time, make some decisions, OK? I've got a lot of very important naps to get to!
NPC Furniture All right. $ENTITY So we're gonna end up changing ... on this $ENTITY then. How should we go about that?&#xF; $ENTITY What do you suggest? Use clothing fabric. Use a custom design. Remove the fabric. Leave it as is.
