BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY It's really nice and warm in here. $ENTITY It's perfect for a nap!
BO Sp Museum_Insect This is the insect exhibit, $ENTITY but I guess it's still a work in progress. $ENTITY It's so nice and warm in here that I'm just gonna hang out until it's complete,... !
BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY It's a good thing I'm not scared of bugs.... Otherwise, I'd be completely wigging out right now!
BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY This place has every single bug out there. $ENTITY It's like a dream come true! $ENTITY But when I pinched myself, $ENTITY it really hurt!... So $ENTITY I guess it isn't a dream after all!
BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY It's always warm in here, $ENTITY so it's the perfect spot for napping.
BO Sp Museum_Insect I heard you can actually eat some bugs. $ENTITY Hm... Which of these bugs do you think would be the tastiest?
BO Sp Museum_Insect I can't tell if that one bug over there is really rare $ENTITY or if it's just a piece of lint.
BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Bugs are like the lobsters of the land. $ENTITY I wonder if they'd taste good with some melted butter and lemon.
BO Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY I love how warm it is in here! $ENTITY It's one of my favorite spots in $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
BO Sp Museum_Insect There's a bug in here that I've had my eyes on for a while. $ENTITY I just can't seem to catch one for myself. $ENTITY Collecting bugs would be so much easier if we could just catch the ones in this exhibit.
