OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY what's this?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY that wasn't very nice!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's a gift from $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY A present from $ENTITY , $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Hey! This is from $ENTITY ! It's the thing I lent out, right?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY What, this is something I lost, $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY What? My package was delivered to $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY This is what I wanted $ENTITY to get me, right?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY What could it be? I guess I'll open it and see, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give ... Well, $ENTITY isn't that nice, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY I really do!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, ... This will fit my room beautifully, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'm really shocked that $ENTITY would give me something so.... thoughtful.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'm so surprised that $ENTITY would send me something so nice.... though I bet it was a lucky guess.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'm not at all surprised $ENTITY sent me such a nice gift! We're such great friends, after all.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY So $ENTITY if you had to guess, $ENTITY what do you think is inside? $ENTITY I'll give you something nice if you guess right, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY You think it's ... Well, let's open it up and see.... 
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY look at this. $ENTITY It actually IS $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So I guess I owe you a prize, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY but it's actually ... No prize for you this time, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right, thanks for bringing that to me, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right, thanks for delivering that to me, $ENTITY . I guess I owe $ENTITY thanks too. And here I thought I wasn't getting along with $ENTITY all that well, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY I know it's a little strange, but I think I'll give you back the $ENTITY I got.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Thanks for making the delivery, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right, thanks for delivering that package. I guess I owe $ENTITY thanks too. And here I thought I wasn't getting along with $ENTITY very well, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY She's really taken such good care of it, $ENTITY . I appreciate that.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY She's so crazy sometimes. $ENTITY I'm delighted that it came back in one piece!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY If there's someone I can depend on to take good care of something and return it nicely wrapped.... well, it's $ENTITY , isn't it? $ENTITY Yes, you can count on her every time, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY You know, she's a little, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY rough around the edges. I'm just tickled pink to get it back at all.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY He even wrapped the package himself? He's usually.... well, to tell you the truth.... so sloppy. But good for him, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, and what is THAT I smell? $ENTITY A hint of sweat? Well, $ENTITY is like that, you know. $ENTITY Sweaty. $ENTITY Still, good manners beats iffy hygiene any day of the week.... If you have to choose.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY He returned it AND wrapped it? How unusual! $ENTITY is usually such a bull in a china shop. $ENTITY Oh, nothing against bulls, you understand. $ENTITY Most just get so angry when wrapping packages. $ENTITY But good for $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY He wrapped that package SO well. $ENTITY Why, I bet he could make an origami $ENTITY if he tried!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY if you had to guess, $ENTITY what do you think is inside the package? $ENTITY I'll give you something nice if you guess correctly, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Well, thank you for delivering that, $ENTITY . Here's a little gift in thanks!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's my ... I thought I'd never see this again, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's my $ENTITY I thought I'd never see it again, so I bought another one.
OT Q06 B_Give Well, why don't you take it then, ... That's great! No, thanks.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY No? So now I'm stuck with two of them? $ENTITY Well, thanks anyway for the delivery, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY There you go then. I'm glad at least YOU made out nicely in all this, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY good-bye. And please give $ENTITY my best.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh well. Maybe I'll sell one of them sometime. $ENTITY I don't want to have a cluttered house, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh well. I guess I'll sell one of them sometime. $ENTITY Even if it's going to be at a loss, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Well, would you like to buy my extra one, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Hmm.... maybe for $ENTITY Bells... Sounds good. No, thanks.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY This just ISN'T my day. I guess I'll just sell it to a shop then.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY . I'd hate to take a loss on this.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right then, give $ENTITY my best, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give Hold on there, $ENTITY . $ENTITY You don't have enough.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'll just take what you DO have and call it good. After all, I owe you for the delivery.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'll just give it to you for free. $ENTITY Besides, I do owe you for the delivery, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give Sorry, but I couldn't part with it for even a Bell less than that. $ENTITY Why, it's not like money grows on trees around here. $ENTITY Well, not exactly anyway.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY But, wait! You don't HAVE any money, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give Sorry, $ENTITY but I couldn't part with it for even a Bell less. $ENTITY Why, $ENTITY I don't mean to be cheap, $ENTITY but I have to renew my subscription to $ENTITY Monthly.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'll just give it to you for free. $ENTITY I suppose I do owe you for the delivery anyway. But don't spread this around town. Otherwise, everyone will come knocking on my door, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY . Now please give $ENTITY my best.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Hmm. What is it, I wonder?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, that's right! I ordered ... !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, that's right! I ordered ... But when that one never got here, I ordered a second one.... so now I have two! $ENTITY I hate to ask, $ENTITY , $ENTITY but would you mind buying one? It's new, so how about.... Bells... Sure, glad to! No, thanks.
OT Q06 B_Give No? But what will I do with two of them? $ENTITY Well, I guess I can always wear them as earrings. Sorry, $ENTITY . It's really my own fault for ordering two. $ENTITY Don't worry about it.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY ! Now I won't lose a single Bell on this whole delivery mess!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I hope you like what's inside the package, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give Hang on there, $ENTITY . $ENTITY You don't have the Bells for that!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'll just settle for what you DO have then. Besides, I owe you something for the delivery.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I suppose I'll just give it to you for free. $ENTITY Besides, I owe you for the delivery, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give Sorry, but I couldn't part with it for less than that. $ENTITY I'm not made of money, you know.... Sure, I dress like it, but really I dress chic on the cheap.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY But, wait! You don't have any Bells, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I'll just give it to you for free. $ENTITY I guess I do owe you something for the delivery. Don't spread it around. I don't want everyone hounding me for freebies.... Nothing against hounds, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give Sorry, I can't sell it for a Bell less than that, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Thanks so much, $ENTITY . And give $ENTITY my thanks too!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, how funny is that? Because I ordered this.... for you! $ENTITY This is more ridiculous than the time I got my $ENTITY stuck in $ENTITY 's mailbox! Go aheadtake the package. $ENTITY It's my gift to you, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give ... Will you open it now? $ENTITY Yes. No.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Not going to open it now? Oh, I understand. It's embarrassing to open gifts in front of others!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's ... I thought it would look perfect on you, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's ... I knew that would be just the thing for you, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I've never been inside your home, but I just KNEW that would be perfect for you.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Since I've been inside your home, I'd like to think I know a thing or two about your style. $ENTITY And THAT is the most perfect thing I've ever seen for you, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Since I've walked around your home, I've picked up on your taste in flooring, $ENTITY . And if that isn't perfect for your house? Well, I'll give up $ENTITY for a month!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Now, since I've looked around your house, I know what you like. $ENTITY And I think THAT will bring just the touch of class I know you've been looking for.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY how funny! I asked $ENTITY to get me this.... for YOU! $ENTITY hasn't messed up this big since playing $ENTITY at $ENTITY party! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY this package is for you,... . $ENTITY And I guess it was still a surprise, $ENTITY wasn't it?
OT Q06 B_Give Let's just take a look.... 
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, I'm so glad! I finally have the $ENTITY I wanted.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's even more lovely than I imagined.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It looks so much better than it did in the window!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY It's really nice. Much nicer than I even thought it would be!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I love getting new clothes!
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY What do you think? Looks nice, right? $ENTITY Very nice! Good. Yuck.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, you're just saying that. $ENTITY But thanks for the compliment.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I really liked what I was wearing. So how about you take my $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right, thanks for the delivery, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Good? $ENTITY You know, I didn't win the $ENTITY Beauty Pageant by being just "good." $ENTITY Oh, I'm sorry, $ENTITY . I have such high standards for myself.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Yuck? $ENTITY Oh, I get it. You're just jealous, right?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY I think I'll wear this a bit longer. After all, I went to so much trouble to get it.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY And why don't you take the $ENTITY I had on?
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY All right, thank you for the delivery, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give Well, I'd better change out of this then.
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Oh, how awful. I really should have tried it on before ordering it, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY Hold on.... this might actually fit your style nicely. How about you keep it as a thank-you gift?
OT Q06 B_Give I bet you'll make it work, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Give $ENTITY You like this sort of thing, right? I mean, who doesn't?
