NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh dear. $ENTITY Pardon me...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY I'm a bit of a night owl. Drowsy in the daytime, you see!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! I welcome you to the $ENTITY Museum.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Welcome to the $ENTITY Museum.
NPC Hu-ta Take your time... Do look around...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our museum is second to none, may I humbly say. Brimming with fish! $ENTITY Chock full of fossils! And blessed with every work of art! $ENTITY Yes, the $ENTITY museum is extraordinary. $ENTITY Hootie hoo!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our collections are quite extensive. Our exhibits, exemplary. Do enjoy yourself thoroughly!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our insect exhibit is unparalleled! Visitors do, $ENTITY shall I say, $ENTITY swarm here from all over to see it. Please enjoy the collection, and then spread, $ENTITY if I dare, $ENTITY the buzz.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our aquarium is truly outstanding! Indeed, $ENTITY we reel in visitors from far and wide. So please be sure to enjoy our fascinating fish. I think you'll get along, $ENTITY if I may, $ENTITY swimmingly.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our fossil collection is especially superb, you know. The exhibit here is anything but dry and dusty! You couldn't see more dinosaurs, $ENTITY in fact, $ENTITY without a time machine. So please enjoy them all.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our art galleries, $ENTITY if I may say, $ENTITY are the very picture of perfection. Yes, the collection is complete! So peruse the portraits. $ENTITY Ambulate through the galleries. $ENTITY It's all a feast for the eyes, $ENTITY so please $ENTITY indulge!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our museum is nearly full. $ENTITY It brims with fish, $ENTITY and I wouldn't say it's infested with insects, $ENTITY but it's close. Yet if it's portraits or fossils you seek, $ENTITY those exhibits are nearing completion too. Enjoy them all.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our museum is filling up, I'll have you know. $ENTITY Yes, we've been feathering this nest quite nicely. So if you're in the mood for this or that, you'll be sure to find it. $ENTITY Visitors always leave quite satisfied.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Our collection is still growing, but you'll be delighted, $ENTITY I'm sure, $ENTITY at what we have. This museum is like a chick taking its first steps. How far we will go! Walk with us, $ENTITY won't you? Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta You'll find our collections are coming along nicely, $ENTITY though we do have a long way to go. Still, I implore you to sift through the empty spaces of our museum. $ENTITY What discovery awaits you! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Is there anything we don't have? Any collection left incomplete? Any exhibit less than exhaustive? Well, $ENTITY to tell the truth, $ENTITY we have absolutely nothing at the moment. But we have heart. So $ENTITY welcome!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Also, don't neglect our shop on the second floor. $ENTITY I think you'll find it quite exquisite!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Also, don't overlook our personal exhibit rooms and museum gift shop on the second floor!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Also, we are currently featuring the $ENTITY exhibit on the second floor. $ENTITY Do see it!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have two personal exhibits on the second floor. $ENTITY The $ENTITY and $ENTITY exhibits are both delightful! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have three personal exhibits on the second floor. $ENTITY The $ENTITY and $ENTITY exhibits are both delightful. I think the $ENTITY exhibit is wonderful as well. $ENTITY Please enjoy them all! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have four personal exhibits on the second floor. $ENTITY The $ENTITY and $ENTITY exhibits are both delightful. I think the $ENTITY and $ENTITY exhibits are excellent too. $ENTITY Enjoy them all!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! Aren't you our new mayor?
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY I am $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY , the director of this museum. It is my honor, $ENTITY entirely, $ENTITY to make your acquaintance. Our museum exhibits the very best in archaeology, $ENTITY the natural sciences, $ENTITY and artfine and otherwise. $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY There I go again. You'll find that each time I open my beak, 10 words fall out when two will do. $ENTITY I do apologize. I've been trying to get better, but when I have a thought that takes flight...! $ENTITY Never mind. Let me start over with, $ENTITY hoo, $ENTITY fewer words. $ENTITY This museum exhibits $ENTITY insects... fish... assessed fossils $ENTITY , $ENTITY and $ENTITY artwork... The reason? $ENTITY To make $ENTITY as great as it can be.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY That's it $ENTITY in a nutshell. You see? $ENTITY Short. $ENTITY I have done it! $ENTITY I have made myself more than concise. Hoo! $ENTITY Now then, an addendum for you! Our second floor has a shop and is reserved for guest exhibits.
NPC Hu-ta But here is our problem. We are currently exhibiting... $ENTITY nothing. $ENTITY Heh. Hoo. It's a tad embarrassing.... But perhaps you can help? Hootie hoo! $ENTITY You can! If you donate your precious finds to the museum, I would be eternally grateful, as would all of $ENTITY .
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY We are open all day $ENTITY and all night, $ENTITY so stop by anytime! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY We are open all day, all night, and every day of the year. Indeed, $ENTITY the $ENTITY museum never sleeps!
NPC Hu-ta ... Huh?... It doesn't seem you have anything on your person that we can accept at the moment... . $ENTITY We take bugs, fish, sea creatures, official $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY -assessed fossils, and works of art. $ENTITY If you have any of those that our museum is currently lacking... $ENTITY we'd absolutely love the donation!
NPC Hu-ta Hmm? $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY How may I be of service? $ENTITY Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY How may I be of service? $ENTITY Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY How may I be of service? $ENTITY Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY How may I be of service? $ENTITY Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh, ... I have something $ENTITY to discuss with you! Hoo! $ENTITY We have filled all our permanent exhibits, thanks to the philanthropy of all who live in $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Such a spirit of giving has made our halls complete!... As such, I will no longer ask for donations. $ENTITY But I wouldn't mind assessing a rogue fossil now and then, $ENTITY so feel free to continue bringing those by. $ENTITY Well then, $ENTITY how may I be of service? $ENTITY Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY May I offer any further assistance? $ENTITY Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY May I offer any further assistance? $ENTITY Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Then please enjoy the rest of your visit!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY What would you like to donate?
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh! My apologies! I cannot accept any donations at this moment. $ENTITY Our town is currently being visited! I must stand vigil solely to serve the needs of visitors who wander in. $ENTITY Can you make your donation at another time? Hoo! I thank you for your patience, $ENTITY .
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo? $ENTITY You've changed your mind? Next time then.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Eeek! $ENTITY A bug... Ah, $ENTITY I beg $ENTITY your pardon!... I just $ENTITY don't like handling these things much! $ENTITY Well... Mmm. Hoo hoo,... This $ENTITY here reminds me vaguely of when I was but a chick in my mother's nest...... Oh! $ENTITY I'm so sorry!... I was about to get rather carried away there! $ENTITY Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of this critter... We'll display it later with a more detailed description, so please come back to see it. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo... reminds me of a time when I was still in my baby feathers... Ah! $ENTITY I beg your pardon!... I was about to go on a tangent there! $ENTITY Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of it here... We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it anytime you'd like. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh hoo hoo... reminds me of a time when my dear mother tucked me under her wing... Ah! $ENTITY I beg your pardon!... I was but a hair away from getting distracted! $ENTITY Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of it here... We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it whenever you'd like. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY Why, that must be ... , if I'm not entirely mistaken! $ENTITY Yes, surely!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY Unless I'm mistaken, that is ... Indeed! $ENTITY What joy! $ENTITY It is!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Hoo hoo! What luck! $ENTITY Is that ... Yes, $ENTITY undoubtedly!
NPC Hu-ta Well, we shall take very good care of this, you have my word... We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it at any time. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY Oh! My word, isn't that $ENTITY ...? $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh dear! Upon closer examination, I have grave news to share with you, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It's a fake! Why, it's as clear as the difference between $ENTITY and $ENTITY ! Shocking! $ENTITY I'm sorry to say I must turn down this most generous donation. Hoo, yes, $ENTITY I must give it back.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Could it be? You're donating the $ENTITY ?
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Let me just see here... $ENTITY Hmmm. $ENTITY Well... Oh...! $ENTITY Hoo hoo!
NPC Hu-ta After some consideration, I declare it to be ... Yes, without a doubt.
NPC Hu-ta Oh my! $ENTITY Upon examination, it's most certainly $ENTITY !
NPC Hu-ta Eureka! $ENTITY Yes, most certainly. It's $ENTITY !
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY I will be most delighted to accept your donation. Thank you!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY This has already been donated! I must return this to you. $ENTITY But you have my deepest gratitude!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY I'm very glad to accept your donation.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY You have my thanks. $ENTITY Hoo, if only we had the other pieces, $ENTITY this fine creature would be complete!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY This means... Yes, oh my! The $ENTITY is at last complete! $ENTITY Ahhh... . The $ENTITY is surely an amazing creature! $ENTITY You know, when it comes to the $ENTITY , what I love most is how... Ah! $ENTITY I'm so sorry!... My mind started to race with thoughts of the $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Anyhoo, I promise we will take excellent care of it here... We'll add a detailed description as well, so please go take a look at the... display soon!
NPC Hu-ta ... Hmm? Hoo? But you have no unknown fossils for me to inspect. $ENTITY Sadly, $ENTITY I cannot assess that which needs no assessing.... Hoo! $ENTITY A bit of museum humor. $ENTITY So rich. $ENTITY Hoo hoo!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! What would you like me to assess?
NPC Hu-ta Hoo? $ENTITY No? Well, never mind. I respect your decision entirely.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Here. Let me give this back to you.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY We don't have this fossil in our collection. Would you consider donating it, ... OK, donated! Sorry, no.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo! Wonderful! $ENTITY I'll add it to our collection!
NPC Hu-ta Ah, yes. Well then, $ENTITY here you go.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hold on! Was this possibly...? $ENTITY Could it perhaps be...? $ENTITY Has the dream finally come $ENTITY true? $ENTITY Yes! The museum's collections are completely, thoroughly complete!... Hoo! Simply stupendous! $ENTITY No town can boast of a bigger or better collection than the one here in $ENTITY . $ENTITY Oh, the generosity that made this possible! My thanks to you and all who supported this dream. $ENTITY You have my deepest gratitude. And may ALL who love this place as much as you know it too. For a museum is only as great as its patrons, and people like you have made it a most magnificent place!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY This is the last of what we need for the aquarium! $ENTITY How wonderful! We can now call our aquarium complete. Thank you from the depths of my heart!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY Is this the last insect we need to complete our collection? $ENTITY Our insect exhibit is complete! Oh, how my heart flutters just to imagine it. $ENTITY Ick!... Perhaps flutters is the wrong word for it! $ENTITY But, $ENTITY I'll manage, I suppose. $ENTITY It is for the greatest good and the sake of our museum,... so you have my deepest thanks!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY No, it cannot be! This is the final piece we need for our art collection! $ENTITY Oh, now our gallery is the very portrait of perfection! I thank you for being a champion of art!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY What, the final fossil? Impossible... but true! $ENTITY Oh, and if I may be a little dated, may I just say that I really $ENTITY your devotion to fossils? $ENTITY Because I most certainly do. Thanks for your commitment.
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY We certainly hope you'll keep up the good work!
NPC Hu-ta ... ooooo...... WHO?! $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta Hoooo... $ENTITY Hmm... $ENTITY What's wrong? Hey, hello?!
NPC Hu-ta ... Oh! $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta Why, Mayor! I was just trying my best to solve a dilemma. But I must admit, I'm fairly stuck. Oh! $ENTITY May I ask your thoughts on the matter?
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Though our collection has grown, our museum just isn't drawing the attendance I hoped for. I know the very thing that will bring more visitors, of course.... The museum must be remodeled! $ENTITY We have a second floor that is going unused at the moment. It would be perfect for something fresh! Oh yes, what we need is an exhibit space where everyone in $ENTITY can display what THEY want!
NPC Hu-ta Now $ENTITY my dilemma: $ENTITY As the director here, I have big dreams for our museum... . but no Bells. $ENTITY I don't have the funds to remodel the museum. $ENTITY But, Mayor, $ENTITY this place is a public service, so perhaps... . maybe we could have this added to the list of $ENTITY public works projects $ENTITY for the town? $ENTITY Would you consider making this a priority for ... As mayor, you can make this dream come true! $ENTITY I'll tell your secretary, $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , in case you'd like to help out.... My thanks in advance, Mayor. $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta Why, Mayor! How fortuitous I should see you right now! Hoo! $ENTITY For I am once again flummoxed, possibly even vexed, $ENTITY by a problem!... If anyone can help, it's you.
NPC Hu-ta This time my dilemma involves a friend. $ENTITY Truth be told, an old acquaintance named $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY . He is a master coffee brewer.... But this fellow has no place where he can put his skills to use! $ENTITY So why not open a caf here in $ENTITY ? Visitors would love it.... Imagine, $ENTITY if I may say, $ENTITY the good buzz!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY we now come to the problem. I cannot ever hope to build a caf on my own. $ENTITY I'm sure my friend would delight all of $ENTITY . I can vouch for his skills as a conjurer of coffee. But I can't say abracadabra and make this dream a reality. Hoo, what to do...
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Of course, the answer is standing right before me. $ENTITY You, Mayor! $ENTITY You have the power, hoo. A $ENTITY caf $ENTITY would benefit $ENTITY ! In fact, what sort of town doesn't have a proper coffeemonger? $ENTITY Yes, I'm firmly convinced. I'll be sure to share this plan with your secretary, $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY . The fate of the caf, $ENTITY indeed, $ENTITY of my good friend too, $ENTITY is in your hands, Mayor. $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoot!... Oh, several things, I see!... Let's take a look, shall we ... #xE; $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Yes!... We will gladly take these off your hands!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY HOO!... I'm afraid fake art has worked its way into the mixture of donations you just gave me... . $ENTITY I'm so terribly sorry, but you do understand we can't display fakes... We'll gladly accept the remaining items for our collection, though!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY HOO-WHAT?!... I'm afraid all of these are works of a nasty impostor... I'm so terribly sorry, but you do understand we can't display fakes. We therefore must pass on these.
NPC Hu-ta ... Ah, $ENTITY there's no need for you to pull them all out!... I'll handle the rest from here! Hoot hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, you're donating multiples of the same item, but we only need one,... so you may keep the extra.
NPC Hu-ta ... What's this? $ENTITY Could it be... .? $ENTITY Hootie hoo! $ENTITY It seems a number of our collections have been completed in one fell swoop with your help! $ENTITY What a grand happenstance! $ENTITY Nothing makes me happier than seeing a finished collection! $ENTITY Don't fret. We'll take good care of your wonderful donations! $ENTITY Thank you once again for all your support and generosity!
NPC Hu-ta We pride ourselves in exhibiting all donations in a timely manner.... Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Ooh hoo!... More than one, I see!... Let's take a closer look ... #xE; $ENTITY 
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY All of these are rare fossils not yet found in our museum's collection ... . $ENTITY What a surprise! $ENTITY You have a knack for finding fossils, don't you? $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY incredibly jealous ... .... I hope I can convince you to donate them for $ENTITY 's cultural development ... . $ENTITY In the meantime, I shall return these to you ... . Do think about donating them, though! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Hoo hoo! $ENTITY I do believe I've found something that's not yet part of our museum's collection ... . $ENTITY It's really most stunning! $ENTITY I believe you have a natural talent for fossils! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY rather jealous ... .... I hope I can perhaps convince you to assist with $ENTITY 's cultural education ... . $ENTITY In the meantime, I shall return these to you ... . Do think about donating, though! Hoo hoot!
NPC Hu-ta $ENTITY Well, well... All of these are simply quite splendid! $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY our museum already has these fossils on display! $ENTITY If only $ENTITY I had the funds, I'd buy them for my own personal collection... . $ENTITY I suppose some dreams aren't meant to come true every day. $ENTITY For now, I'll give these back to you.
