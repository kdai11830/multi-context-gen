BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY So what can I help you with?... Tell me everything, $ENTITY 
BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY Remember that thing I borrowed from you? $ENTITY Well, I spaced out and totally forgot I had it. Anyway, I wanted to return it. Sorry I had it for so long,... .
BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY So that's where my $ENTITY went. $ENTITY I totally forgot that I lent it to you. ... It smells like ... You spilled your food on it, didn't you,... ? $ENTITY So typical of you. $ENTITY Well, I guess it's just a little memento to remember you by. $ENTITY 
BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY Remember that thing you were looking for? $ENTITY Well, I found one, so I got it for you. $ENTITY Am I thoughtful, or what?!

BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY So I found this lying around near $ENTITY 's house.... But I'm pretty sure it's yours. $ENTITY Will you take a look?

BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY I could really go for some $ENTITY pasta!... Where's the best place to get some, $ENTITY ?
BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you won't find any around here. $ENTITY If you want an authentic bowl of pasta, $ENTITY you'll have to work for it. $ENTITY First, you need to fly to the other side of the world. $ENTITY The flight MUST be at least 12 hours long. $ENTITY Then, you take a day-long bus ride to the most rural village you can find. $ENTITY It MUST be very remote! $ENTITY From there, $ENTITY walk 10 miles uphill to the local market and find the fruit vendor. $ENTITY He MUST be selling fruit! And then invite yourself over to dinner at his grandmother's farm. Good pasta MUST be made by a grandmother,... If you follow all these steps EXACTLY, $ENTITY you will have the BEST pasta experience of your life.
BO Q04 3P_Zk $ENTITY Wait... . $ENTITY What did I want to talk to you about? $ENTITY I had it a second ago, but now I've completely forgotten. $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY !

BO Q04 3P_Zk Well, $ENTITY it's time for me to head out. $ENTITY Thanks for showing me around, ... See you,... .
BO Q04 3P_Zk Guess we're done here. $ENTITY I should take my leave then. $ENTITY If I stay any longer, $ENTITY I might never stop talking.... Later!
