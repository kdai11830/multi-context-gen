NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY OK, Mayor ... Please lead me to the spot where you'd like to place the $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY Mayor!... Is this about where you'd like to place the $ENTITY #x0; What do you think? Cancel project. Nah, somewhere else.
NPC Secretary Pworks I understand.... Well, when you've decided on a final placement, please let me know!
NPC Secretary Pworks What do you think? $ENTITY Is this the spot? $ENTITY Yep! Gotta think this over.
NPC Secretary Pworks Oh my, $ENTITY is there something you don't like about it?... Well, if you find another good spot, $ENTITY let me know!
NPC Secretary Pworks Understood!... Well, let's go ahead and start the needed preparations!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Let's see... I think $ENTITY there are plans to build a $ENTITY house for a resident $ENTITY here, $ENTITY so it'd be hard to put it in this spot.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the $ENTITY ocean $ENTITY that I think it would be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the $ENTITY river $ENTITY that I think it would be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the $ENTITY lake $ENTITY that I think it would be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the $ENTITY cliff $ENTITY that I think it would be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to $ENTITY your house $ENTITY , Mayor, that I think it would be very difficult to place it here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to a $ENTITY resident's home $ENTITY that I think it would be very tough to place it right here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the... that it'd be very difficult to place it right here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to the $ENTITY train tracks $ENTITY that I think it would be very difficult to place it here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's so close to a giant $ENTITY rock $ENTITY that I think it'd be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's a bit too close to the $ENTITY event plaza $ENTITY , so it'd be very difficult to place the project here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... It's just so close to $ENTITY something else $ENTITY that I think it would be very tough to place it right here.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY We're planning to put in a new $ENTITY this time... From where you're standing now, Mayor, $ENTITY empty section of land $ENTITY that's $ENTITY left $ENTITY and $ENTITY right $ENTITY ! And then another $ENTITY spaces back... Basically, you need a lot of space! $ENTITY However, if it's going to be next to something else, I think it'd be best to have extra space on all sides.
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Oh my... . $ENTITY You want to cancel the project to commission a new ... Yes, let's quit. No, let's keep going.
NPC Secretary Pworks Understood. $ENTITY In that case, $ENTITY I'll head back to the town hall to work on the project-canceling procedures! $ENTITY It's OK if you decide not to head back there yourself, Mayor! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I'm off to the town hall!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Understood! $ENTITY Well then, let's continue the search for a good location!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... Yes! $ENTITY I think this would be perfect!
NPC Secretary Pworks We'll need to remove the plants and anything buried underground, but if that's OK with you, $ENTITY this spot is fine! $ENTITY It will probably look something like this when it's all finished ... . $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY It will probably look something like this when it's all finished ... . $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY All set! $ENTITY To help us gather donations to fund the $ENTITY is our helpful town gyroid, $ENTITY Lloid $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary Pworks ... . $ENTITY Ah, ummmmmm,... he's basically like $ENTITY a $ENTITY donations box... I'm sure I mentioned it to you before, but... All of the construction costs for public works projects in $ENTITY are covered entirely by donations. $ENTITY Of course, you can chip in some of your own money too, Mayor! $ENTITY Actually... I get the feeling we won't be able to gather enough funds if you don't help us out.... Please don't forget to donate!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY It's going to be hard to wait for all the donations to arrive so we have our $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Well, I must return to the town hall!... Ah! $ENTITY You don't need to worry about making the trip back, Mayor! $ENTITY OK then, $ENTITY I'll be taking my leave!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY It will be hard to wait for all the donations we'll need to complete the $ENTITY here! $ENTITY By the way, including this new one, we can have a total of $ENTITY three $ENTITY bridges in town at any one time. As such, if you want to build a new bridge after that, you'll have to $ENTITY demolish $ENTITY an existing bridge first. ... Well then, I'm going to make my way back to the town hall! $ENTITY Ah! $ENTITY There's no need for you to go back with me, Mayor! $ENTITY I'll just be taking my leave now!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Yes, Mayor!... Would you like to set the $ENTITY somewhere around here then? $ENTITY What do you think? Cancel project. Nah, somewhere else.
NPC Secretary Pworks I understand.... Very well, when you've decided on a place for the bridge, please let me know!
NPC Secretary Pworks Mayor... There's no point in putting a bridge anywhere but near a river! $ENTITY When you're near a spot $ENTITY next to the river $ENTITY that you'd like the bridge to go, please let me know!
NPC Secretary Pworks What's the matter, $ENTITY Mayor?... Let's finish our work first!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Um... $ENTITY Ummmmmmmm... $ENTITY Please wait for me!
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... The width of the river here is different than the shape of the bridge. I think that would make it difficult to build across right here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Hmmmmmmm... There's already a bridge here, so don't you think that's enough... .?
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... This is so close to $ENTITY your house $ENTITY , Mayor! $ENTITY I think it would be difficult to place a bridge here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... Your house $ENTITY is so close on the other side that it would be tough to place a bridge here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... This is so close to a $ENTITY resident's home $ENTITY , so placing a bridge here may cause problems... .

NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... There seems to be $ENTITY in the way of building. I think that would make it difficult to place a bridge here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... There seems to be $ENTITY on the other side that's in the way. As a result, it might be difficult to place a bridge right here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... There's a very large $ENTITY rock $ENTITY nearby, so I think it would be difficult to place a bridge here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... There's a very large $ENTITY rock $ENTITY on the other side. $ENTITY That's going to make it a lot more difficult to build a bridge here... .
NPC Secretary Pworks $ENTITY Well, let's see... There are plans to build a $ENTITY home for a future resident $ENTITY right here. $ENTITY I think putting a bridge here would cause some problems... .
