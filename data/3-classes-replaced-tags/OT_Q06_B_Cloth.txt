OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, ... I simply adore this sort of look, and the color is lovely, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, ... I really love the color of this, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, ... I'm very into this sort of look right now, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, ... How nice, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh.... What a lovely color. $ENTITY Too bad I'm not into this kind of look, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh.... I don't love this look, $ENTITY and the color isn't great either. ... 
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, maybe I'll have a use for it. $ENTITY Perhaps as an extra rag for the occasional $ENTITY spill.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I think I'll try it on right now.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Yes, I think it's really a fine style for me, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What do you think? You've got a good eye for fashion. $ENTITY Very nice! Ick.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you always know the right thing to say, $ENTITY . $ENTITY You're sweet as $ENTITY , aren't you?
OT Q06 B_Cloth Well, what do you know? $ENTITY Why, I haven't been so insulted since $ENTITY said I had the fashion sense of $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth So I shouldn't rely on your eye for style. I'm going to wear it no matter WHAT you think, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth Well, you were just being honest, weren't you? $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY I do like it, but what do you recommend? $ENTITY Wear it. I was wrong! Double ick.
OT Q06 B_Cloth Thanks, $ENTITY . I think I will stick with this style.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, when a good friend like you is quick with a "double ick," I'll give up on this, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, what was I thinking? Trying on clothes I didn't buy for myself?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What? This looks so different on me than I thought it would!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY But I guess I just look twice as nice as I was prepared for, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth I guess even my fashion sense can be a little off every now and then, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I think I'll just try it on a little later, though, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I should probably try it on then, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. Pretty good.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What do you think? It's a nice look for me, right? $ENTITY Yes, perfect! No, gross!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY You're such a flatterer, ... Next you'll be telling me I'm perfect at $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh, as if you would know! $ENTITY Why, I haven't been this insulted since.... well, since $ENTITY said that $ENTITY has more spice than my wardrobe!
OT Q06 B_Cloth I'm NOT about to change for someone who says I look gross, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY But just in case you're right.... maybe I'll change back.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Maybe I should try it on?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What do you think? And be honest, ... Super! Good. Terrible.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, if YOU say so, $ENTITY , then it's got to look great!
OT Q06 B_Cloth Hmm.... Just good, $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 B_Cloth Well, if you're fine with it and $ENTITY picked it out.... then I feel better about it.
OT Q06 B_Cloth I just don't know what to make of a so-so review from you. $ENTITY I hope you'd tell me if it looked awful. $ENTITY But I'm not taking any chances, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth Terrible? $ENTITY Well, like my mother always told me.... all the fairy dust in the world can't turn $ENTITY into $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth I'll try it on a little later.
OT Q06 B_Cloth I'll try this on a little later. I just don't feel very confident about it. $ENTITY Let's see it now! Yeah, later.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY Well, if you insist... .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What do you think? And be honest, ... Perfect. Not bad. Eeeek!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Perfect? Good thing you told me to try it on then, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth What? Not bad? $ENTITY But that's not exactly good either, right? Oh, why did you tell me to try it on?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, I'm sure you didn't mean anything by it. Not bad just means $ENTITY not.... bad, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY And since $ENTITY picked it out for me, I think I'll keep wearing it.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, no harm done. Let's just forget about this fashion faux pas.
OT Q06 B_Cloth What? Eeeek? $ENTITY Oh, why did you make me try it on then? $ENTITY Get it off! Get it off!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY But maybe I'll try it on later, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth But it was a gift, so maybe I should try it on.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, maybe it IS the color, but it's not nearly as iffy as I thought!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY What do you think? I really want to know, ... Hmm, pretty good! Ugh, no.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Really? Then I think I'll stick with this look for a while.
OT Q06 B_Cloth Oh, really? That bad?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY But I'm stuck with it now. After all, $ENTITY gave it to me, so I wouldn't want to be rude.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY But I really DO love the color. So maybe I'll stick with it anyway.
OT Q06 B_Cloth Well, enough of this weird fashion experiment. $ENTITY No friend of mine would ever buy me THIS as a gift.
OT Q06 B_Cloth But maybe I should try it on, just for laughs!
OT Q06 B_Cloth No, I just don't think this is going to work. It's just not right for me.
OT Q06 B_Cloth Oh, I just don't think this look will be right for me at ALL. $ENTITY Why not try it? Don't.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Really? This thing? $ENTITY I'd rather wear a dress dunked in a bucket of $ENTITY . $ENTITY But.... if you insist.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Oh! It looks better than I thought it would! $ENTITY I guess my friend has great fashion taste.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Yes, it's just as awful as I thought, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth Well, now I just don't know WHAT to think. I need your advice. $ENTITY Honestly, it's nice. Words fail me.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY Then I'll take a risk on this, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth You don't need to tell me. I know I look like a monster.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY can be sloppy when it comes to style.... so this was a nice surprise, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY barely knows the difference between a wardrobe and a locker.... So I'm surprised he picked out something so fitting for me, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY can get so frustrated with things, so I'm delighted by his subtle style selection!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY has an excellent sense of style, so I'm not surprised he chose something nice.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY is so sensible, yet she doesn't always have the best fashion sense, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Still, she did nicely this time. $ENTITY Who knew she would pick such a lovely fashion match for me?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY thinks she's such a fashionista, but she's actually got fairly questionable taste. $ENTITY But this time, she really did pick something nice for me!
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY You know, everyone says that $ENTITY is too picky when it comes to fashion. $ENTITY But I think this proves she's not picky.... just VERY selective.... Good for her, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. That $ENTITY usually can't tell the difference between a trash can and a wardrobe. $ENTITY But this time she really displayed great taste. I'm so proud of how that girl's coming along.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, I guess this gift means $ENTITY and I will put things behind us then, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, I suppose this present means $ENTITY and I will definitely patch things up, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY So I guess this gift means $ENTITY and I should probably put things behind us.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY I suppose this present means $ENTITY and I will probably patch things up.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY So.... I guess this gift means that $ENTITY and I will have to put things behind us, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm.... I suppose this present means that $ENTITY and I will have to patch things up, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I guess this gift means $ENTITY really wants to put those bad feelings behind us, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, even though that wasn't a good look for me, I guess I do appreciate the thought.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well, even though that style wasn't very fitting for me, I suppose it's the thought that counts.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Hmm.... That wasn't a good look for me, but I have to admit I do appreciate the thought.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Well.... that style wasn't very fitting for me, but it's the thought that counts, right?
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Ugh.... that wasn't a good look, $ENTITY but I guess I'd better be gracious and say it was a nice thought.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Ugh.... that style wasn't at all fitting for me. But they say it's the thought that counts. $ENTITY Hmm.... 
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I guess $ENTITY really was just trying to make amends by sending over this gift.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY I suppose $ENTITY was just trying to smooth things over between us with this gift.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Despite all this mess, $ENTITY was just trying to make amends after our, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY last mess.
OT Q06 B_Cloth $ENTITY Despite this awfulness, $ENTITY was only trying to clear the air after that war of words we had.
