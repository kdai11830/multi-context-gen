BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Augh! $ENTITY It's an ogre!
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Augh! $ENTITY An ogre!... Those fangs are freaking me out,... 
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Augh! $ENTITY I didn't know that ogres actually existed,... !
BO Ev Setsubun Shoo! $ENTITY Get outta here, ogre! $ENTITY And gimme some good luck today!
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY It wouldn't be $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY without some good old-fashioned bean throwing! I didn't hurt you, did I? $ENTITY Sorry about that,... !
BO Ev Setsubun I sure hope all this bean throwing will keep us safe from ogres. $ENTITY My arm's getting tired!
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY That didn't do anything?... You must be trying to trick me! $ENTITY You can't fool me, ogre! $ENTITY I'm gonna keep throwing beans at you all day! $ENTITY 
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY AUGH! $ENTITY Where'd you get those beans, ogre?! $ENTITY It's not fair! $ENTITY You can throw them or get them thrown at you, $ENTITY but not both!
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Nooo! $ENTITY It's a bean-toting ogre!... We're all doomed, $ENTITY !
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Ogre!... I'm gonna bean you good! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You've got beans too?... But how can that beeeeee, $ENTITY !
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Man, $ENTITY I could eat a whole mountain of beans.
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Bean Day... and I'm psyched to use my beans to chase off some ogres,... ! Even though I'm still kind of scared of them... .
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY So $ENTITY is it true the only thing that really works against ogres is... .beans?
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Look at all those beans you've got there, ... I hope you're using them to fight bad luck $ENTITY and not just to, like, make chili or something.
BO Ev Setsubun I know I'm not an ogre, $ENTITY but I don't mind if you throw some beans at me, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I could use a quick snack right about now,... .
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY You lucky duck! $ENTITY You've got some beans! $ENTITY Their taste is mild, but they're still good! $ENTITY To be honest, $ENTITY I think throwing them is kind of a waste, $ENTITY even if it does get rid of ogres,... .
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I'm happy to see you and I are both totally stocked with beans. $ENTITY We are ready to fight bad luck! $ENTITY Now we just gotta wait for some ogres to stumble by,... .
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Looks like we're both all set in the bean department, huh?... Now all we need is an ogre,... .
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Are your beans for warding off bad luck? $ENTITY Or are they for eating?... I love how versatile beans are!
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Step back, ogre! $ENTITY Or get ready to taste my beany wrath! $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY Where'd my beans run off to,... ?
BO Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Ogres aren't allowed in my house! $ENTITY Get out of here,... !
BO Ev Setsubun It's weird to say, $ENTITY but I feel kind of bad for you, $ENTITY what with everyone throwing beans at you. $ENTITY I guess you can hang out in my house for a while if you want,... .
