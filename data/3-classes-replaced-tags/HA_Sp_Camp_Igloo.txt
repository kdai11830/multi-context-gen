HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Oh! You came here to play even though it's so cold outside? $ENTITY Don't catch a cold, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;!... !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I've been to quite a few towns... But this town is about as good as any I've seen!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Brrr... Winter camping is so cold! $ENTITY I really should exercise at times like this to keep my body as warm as possible!... !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY This town is really cozy during the winter! $ENTITY It's kind of like relaxing in a ski lodge! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I was running in the cold without paying much attention, and the next thing I knew I was here! $ENTITY I didn't wanna waste my trip, so I decided to settle in and camp! $ENTITY It's like an impromptu vacation! $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Hey! Do you live in this town? $ENTITY Huh? Are you asking if I'm cold? $ENTITY I can play outside in any kind of weather! $ENTITY Enduring the elements is easy when you've got muscle!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I was really focused on running. I ran and ran and ran. And when I looked up, I was in this town! $ENTITY I wonder how far I ran... Maybe a hundred miles or so? $ENTITY Anyway, I just need to rest my old muscles for a bit!! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Hey! Do you think it's OK if I camp here for a while? $ENTITY I'm just asking to be nice. As you can see, I'm already camping here! $ENTITY I'll just stay here for a little while. $ENTITY Nice to meet you,... .
HA Sp Camp_Igloo Hmmm. I can't decide where exactly I want to build a house! $ENTITY But, hey! $ENTITY Having no plans at all could actually be pretty cool!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo ... Whoa, $ENTITY I'm sorry! $ENTITY I was just thinking about what kind of training would be best for this area.... .
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Nice! The air here is so fresh! $ENTITY But I guess once I start living here, I'll take it for granted, huh? $ENTITY Somebody out there! Please help me remember to appreciate fresh air!... !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I was invited by $ENTITY . That's how I decided to move here! $ENTITY I hope you don't mind if this town gets a bit noisier now that I'll be doing my training here!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I'm moving into this town, so I hope we'll be good neighbors! $ENTITY Just so you know, I already have $ENTITY 's blessing to move in!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I'm going to be a resident of this town!... I talked to $ENTITY and decided to move here. $ENTITY All right! I'm gonna whip everyone in this town into shape! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Be careful while camping in the winter! If you're not prepared, you could get super cold, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;! $ENTITY But that feeling of danger kind of makes you feel like you're having an adventure, right? $ENTITY ?
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY is really quiet at night! $ENTITY It feels like it will echo if I yell! $ENTITY Heee $ENTITY lloooo! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Camp_Igloo I should have brought my skis! $ENTITY Winter sports are fun, mostly because you can never do them in the summer,... !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY In a way, the freezing temperatures are the best part of camping in the winter! $ENTITY When you have hot stew in the cold, you can feel it spreading around all through your body!... !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I made some stew! $ENTITY I let it simmer for a long time till all the vegetables are almost melting... Then I $ENTITY slurp it all down!! $ENTITY Heh heh! Don't try this move if you're an amateur soup eater, OK?
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I went running around the trees, and the cold breeze felt so good! $ENTITY This town is really nice! Makes me think I might wanna live here! $ENTITY Just move in! ...
HA Sp Camp_Igloo This is totally out of the blue, $ENTITY but what brings pride to this town?... There must be something, right? $ENTITY Well then, $ENTITY I can be the face and character of this town! $ENTITY Hmm. But for me to do so, I'll need to move here... You should! No, thanks.
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I really like your town! $ENTITY You know, it really feels like this is the type of place that would be good for my complexion! Yeah... This is way too nice a place to just say good-bye to once I'm done camping. ... You should move here! Please come again!
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Ha ha! Does it make you happy to hear good things about your town? $ENTITY I'm not the type to just hand out empty compliments! $ENTITY Be proud of your town! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Camp_Igloo That's too bad! I would've been great for your town, but... Oh well.
HA Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Of course! I'll come again for sure! I just don't know when that will be,... .
