GE Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Remember that time I absolutely BEGGED you to let me borrow that cool thingie of yours? $ENTITY I thought it was about time $ENTITY to return it to you. $ENTITY As a surprise, $ENTITY I decorated it with shiny stickers!
GE Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY WHAT?! $ENTITY Look, $ENTITY it's nice of you to return it and all, $ENTITY but you shouldn't have plastered it with stickers! $ENTITY That's really going to damage the $ENTITY resale value,... .

GE Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Hold up! $ENTITY I don't need a makeover. My life is just fine. $ENTITY Maybe it's not perfect, but it's very acceptable. $ENTITY And if I let you touch my wardrobe, you'd probably just sew pink bows to everything! $ENTITY So no way, $ENTITY sister!
