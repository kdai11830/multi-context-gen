FU 3P Zk $ENTITY It was really nice of you to play that song for me earlier.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Of course. $ENTITY Did you like it? $ENTITY I wrote all the lyrics myself. $ENTITY I think this could lead to my big break.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY I liked it a lot. $ENTITY It was very romantic.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY 
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Right? $ENTITY I was totally thinking about all the pretty girls in town when I wrote it. $ENTITY Hey, ... What do you think about love songs? $ENTITY Are they clichd or sweet? $ENTITY Ugh, clichd! Aww, sweet!
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY I didn't know you felt that way. $ENTITY I bet the ladies love them, though.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY See!... Love songs are the soul's way of... singing about love. $ENTITY They do make the ladies swoon.

FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Thank you for sending me that nice handwritten poem the other day.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY My pleasure. $ENTITY What did you think?
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY The pacing and rhymes were nice. $ENTITY And I liked the part where you compared the earth to a dung beetle.... It was very philosophical.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY 
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Wasn't it? $ENTITY Maybe you should be my muse.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY But you misspelled a few words, $ENTITY and your punctuation was lacking. $ENTITY So I corrected it and sent it back to you!
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY I was probably tired when I wrote it.... Making mistakes just isn't my style. $ENTITY Good thing I have you to check my work for me.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Wasn't it? $ENTITY Maybe you should be my muse.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Your muse? $ENTITY What do you mean?
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Your beauty and grace inspire me. $ENTITY You $ENTITY feed my creativity!
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY In that case $ENTITY , you could probably use better metaphors. $ENTITY I can help you with them.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY What? $ENTITY My metaphors are the banana peels of my soul!
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY You want me to go shopping with you?
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Mm-hmm. $ENTITY I'm thinking about buying a new hat, $ENTITY so I might need your help after to make it look vintage.
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I don't have any errands I need to run today, so $ENTITY I wasn't planning on heading up there... 
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY Then how about we go fishing together?
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY I'm sorry, $ENTITY but I don't really feel like going fishing at the moment... Hi, ... We were just discussing our plans for the rest of the day.
FU 3P Zk !
FU 3P Zk $ENTITY I wouldn't call them plans, per se.... I'm much too spontaneous for that. $ENTITY I just like spending time with the beautiful creatures of the world.
