OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY I have to admit $ENTITY I'm jealous of the relationship $ENTITY and $ENTITY have with each other. $ENTITY They always seem like they're having fun $ENTITY and not arguing over silly things.... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY and $ENTITY are really good friends, $ENTITY aren't they? $ENTITY I'm jealous. $ENTITY I don't have any female friends as close as that.
OT FreeA Friend Who says men and women can't be good friends? Just look at $ENTITY and $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY some people think they're secretly more than just friends... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY I always see $ENTITY and $ENTITY out practicing $ENTITY together. It must be nice to have a close friend who's into the same things as you are... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Have you ever spent any time hanging out with $ENTITY and $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I want to know whether they're really good friends $ENTITY or just pretending... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Don't $ENTITY and $ENTITY seem like a cute couple? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY don't get me wrong $ENTITY they're not a couple. $ENTITY Yet... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Boys can get into a fight and then go back to being best friends within a few hours, $ENTITY it seems. $ENTITY Maybe $ENTITY and $ENTITY just need to wrestle it out and then they'll get along better.
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Am I imagining things, $ENTITY or do $ENTITY and $ENTITY just not get along very well? I'm not one to spread rumors... OK, maybe I am.
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY I hate to gossip, $ENTITY but I couldn't help noticing that $ENTITY and $ENTITY are feuding again. $ENTITY I think they secretly like each other. $ENTITY That's why they argue so much.
OT FreeA Friend Hey, ... do you know ... I ask because she's a good friend of mine.... We can talk about anything together. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I thought you and she could be good friends too. $ENTITY You should come out with us sometime!
OT FreeA Friend ... would you say you're friends with ... She's a little shy, $ENTITY so it's hard to get to know her, $ENTITY but it's worth the effort. $ENTITY Maybe the three of us should get together sometime. $ENTITY Do you like $ENTITY ?
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY This might seem like an odd question, $ENTITY but what do you think of $ENTITY ? $ENTITY We've been friends for a long time, $ENTITY but we recently had a falling out. $ENTITY If you see her, $ENTITY can you tell her I want to make up and be friends again?
OT FreeA Friend Hey, $ENTITY , $ENTITY you know $ENTITY pretty well, $ENTITY don't you? $ENTITY We're acquaintances, $ENTITY but I think we could be really good friends if we took the time to hang out. $ENTITY We should plan a fun activity together sometime. $ENTITY Like... or something.
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY How's it going,... ? $ENTITY This might seem random, $ENTITY but what do you think of $ENTITY ? $ENTITY See, $ENTITY I feel like I barely know her at all. $ENTITY And $ENTITY is a small place. $ENTITY We shouldn't be strangers. $ENTITY We should all get together and share a giant serving of $ENTITY or something.
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Are you friends with $ENTITY Because she just said something really mean to me. $ENTITY Some things are just off limits, $ENTITY you know? $ENTITY I really can't believe the nerve on her! $ENTITY She said my $ENTITY tasted like a microwave dinner. $ENTITY We are SO not friends right now.
OT FreeA Friend You know who I don't really like?... . $ENTITY I know that might be mean to say, $ENTITY but we just clash. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY we both kind of know we're not compatible, $ENTITY and that makes it work somehow. $ENTITY Heh. $ENTITY We're probably friendlier to each other out of respect than we are to our actual friends.
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Who's your best friend in $ENTITY , ... For me it's probably $ENTITY . $ENTITY Some people might think it's weird for a girl to have a boy as her BFF, $ENTITY but somehow it just works. $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY maybe that's why we're such good friendswe don't have that weird rivalry thing going on.
OT FreeA Friend Hey, ... would you say you're good friends with $ENTITY ? Because I kind of think of him as a good friend, $ENTITY but I'm not sure what he thinks about me at all. $ENTITY Boys can be so oblivious sometimes... 
OT FreeA Friend So... and I had a big fight the other day. $ENTITY If you asked him, he'd probably say it was my fault. $ENTITY And he'd probably be right... 
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY You'd probably never guess this, $ENTITY but $ENTITY is one of my favorite people in $ENTITY . $ENTITY He's just a nice guy, $ENTITY and he's really funny $ENTITY too. $ENTITY We both love $ENTITY , so sometimes we get together and practice. $ENTITY !
OT FreeA Friend Hey, $ENTITY , $ENTITY do you know $ENTITY at all? He's like an enigma to me. $ENTITY I say hello when I see him around $ENTITY , $ENTITY but I don't know a thing about him! $ENTITY Do you think I should invite him over for $ENTITY so I can get to know him a little bit?
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY Just a warning,... is a big meanie! $ENTITY We were supposed to get together for some $ENTITY , and he stood me up! $ENTITY It's not like I'm his girlfriend, $ENTITY but a little common courtesy would be nice. $ENTITY Hmph!
OT FreeA Friend $ENTITY You know the saying $ENTITY "opposites attract"? $ENTITY What a crock of butter! $ENTITY See, $ENTITY and I are pretty much exact opposites, $ENTITY but believe me, $ENTITY we don't attract. $ENTITY Oh sure, $ENTITY we're friendly, $ENTITY but we both know some real sparks could fly if we ever clashed.
