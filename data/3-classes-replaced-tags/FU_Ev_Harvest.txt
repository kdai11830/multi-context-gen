FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today is our $ENTITY Harvest Festival... I've been waiting all month for this. $ENTITY It's one of my favorite holidays! $ENTITY I'm going to try making something new this year. $ENTITY Something exciting!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Is everyone else caught up in the festivities? $ENTITY Once I finish up here, I'll join them. $ENTITY But for now I'm still busy cooking... 
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Eep, $ENTITY I need to get started on my next dish! $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY There are just so many things I want to make... 
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Actually, $ENTITY you wouldn't happen to have ... would you? $ENTITY If you did, $ENTITY I'd be willing to trade you for another ingredient. $ENTITY We could both benefit.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I can't complete this dish without ... You don't happen to have one, $ENTITY do you? $ENTITY Yes, please take it! I don't have one.
FU Ev Harvest Say, $ENTITY if you could give me ... that would really help me out! $ENTITY Here you go! I don't have one.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY Please keep me in mind if you come across any later. $ENTITY I'd trade you another ingredient for it!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY I suppose it's not that easy to come by,... .
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Pardon? $ENTITY Were you trying to give me something? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY my mistake.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY That's awfully nice, $ENTITY but I really need ... If you get one, $ENTITY I'd love to trade.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY You'll trade with me? $ENTITY Thank you very much! $ENTITY Here. $ENTITY I can give you my $ENTITY in return.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Wonderful. $ENTITY Now I can finish up this dish and start another! $ENTITY Thank you!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY and I'm not sure if you're interested, but... I stumbled upon a way to make a certain dish taste amazing. $ENTITY Would you like to hear about it?
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So when you're making ... just add a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice. $ENTITY It tastes great!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ready? $ENTITY When you're making ... mix in half a cup of diced $ENTITY apple $ENTITY . $ENTITY That crunchy texture really livens up the dish.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY I figured this out while I was making ... Just stir in honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY . $ENTITY The flavor is divine!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I was in the middle of making this $ENTITY when I accidentally added some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY . $ENTITY Wouldn't you know, $ENTITY it turned out delicious!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I discovered when I made $ENTITY that you can include a tablespoon of $ENTITY butter $ENTITY . It adds a depth and richness that I really like.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY If I make ... I always add a little $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY milk. $ENTITY It helps to balance sweet and spicy.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'll probably head over to the event plaza when I finish cooking,... .
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I tried so many new recipes today! $ENTITY My long-term goal is to mix and match ingredients like a real chef!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY There are still lots of recipes I want to try. $ENTITY I've seen some fascinating shows on the local cooking channel.

FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I love the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... I only tasted a little of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking, but the flavors were amazing.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY It looks like $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY was trying for a healthier menu this year. $ENTITY I'm glad, $ENTITY because I still ate a lot of soup!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I think I ate too much today. $ENTITY Far too much.... But if there was dessert... . I'm sure I could find room for it.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today was so much fun, $ENTITY and that main course... .wow! $ENTITY I wish I knew how $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY mixed his ingredients!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I can't remember a better $ENTITY Harvest Festival... All the food was delicious, $ENTITY and dessert was... .delectable! $ENTITY Whatever $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY did to his usual recipes really worked!

FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was quite the success!... Franklin $ENTITY 's four-course meal was delicious.
FU Ev Harvest Whew... I'm stuffed! $ENTITY You deserve a big pat on the back for helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY cook,... !
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY I like to eat $ENTITY oysters $ENTITY with a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice on them. $ENTITY Just a spritz is enough. Of course it's just my opinion, $ENTITY but I think any dish that uses oysters tastes better with lemon.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY when I make a salad with a lot of $ENTITY mushrooms... I feel like it needs something to give it texture. I used half a cup of diced $ENTITY apples $ENTITY the other day on a whim, $ENTITY and it was perfect!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY have you ever made $ENTITY fruit salad... In most salads you'd use vinegar. $ENTITY But in $ENTITY fruit salad $ENTITY , I think you should use honey. $ENTITY Preferably straight from a $ENTITY beehive... It's just delicious.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY adding dressing to a salad with very different ingredients can be tricky. $ENTITY When it comes to $ENTITY mixed salads... I've found my best friend is a bottle of $ENTITY vinegar... It's simple but effective!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY do you worry that salads with a lot of $ENTITY fish $ENTITY smell too, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY fishy? $ENTITY If you didn't already know, $ENTITY adding some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice really helps with that. $ENTITY I highly recommend it!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY you know it's the season for collecting mushrooms, right? $ENTITY I've been using them a lot lately. I especially like to make $ENTITY mushroom bisque $ENTITY at night. $ENTITY My own little trick is melting a pat of $ENTITY butter $ENTITY on top!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY when I collect lots of $ENTITY shellfish... I turn them into a soup. $ENTITY Then I add a pat of $ENTITY butter $ENTITY on top. That extra touch of cream and salt makes the soup truly delicious!
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY I just love making a soup with lots of different $ENTITY fish $ENTITY in it,... My trick is to squeeze a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on top. $ENTITY It mixes well with the other flavors and smells good.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY have you ever tried making $ENTITY fruit soup... It's not just for dessert. $ENTITY It works as a regular soup course too. $ENTITY I've discovered that adding some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY right before you serve it works well to keep it fresh.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let me tell you. $ENTITY I caught a lobster while free diving and used it to make $ENTITY tom yum kung... When I added milk from a $ENTITY coconut... it turned out great! $ENTITY The perfect accent, and I highly recommend it.
FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY Anytime you're cooking fish, $ENTITY it's crucial to use $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY for flavor. $ENTITY Which one tastes better depends on the type of fish you're cooking!

FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Here's my tip for baking a $ENTITY fruit pie... Just accentuate the fruit's natural sweetness with a little honey! $ENTITY And the best honey comes from the town's $ENTITY beehives... It's the perfect dessert for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !

FU Ev Harvest $ENTITY Regular fruit pies are delicious, $ENTITY but using $ENTITY mixed fruits $ENTITY makes a pie even better! $ENTITY There's only one difference. I use a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY in mixed-fruit pies to temper the fruit's natural sweetness. $ENTITY It's the perfect balance!
