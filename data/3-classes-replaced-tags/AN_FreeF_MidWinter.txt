AN FreeF MidWinter Dude... it is sooooo coooold! Makes you really appreciate the warmth of the sun! $ENTITY I guess I take it for granted, but the sun works its butt off to keep us all warm, $ENTITY !
AN FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY As soon as you realize daylight isn't coming, it really makes you miss the light, you know? $ENTITY Ahhh! $ENTITY I can't wait for that warm, sunny sunshine, $ENTITY !
AN FreeF MidWinter Hey, uh... why exactly is it that the sun doesn't come out during the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I mean, does the sun go off to some faraway place for a one-day vacation or something? $ENTITY Arggh! Dude! $ENTITY Now I can't stop thinking about it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY So basically the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is the day when the sun is weakest? $ENTITY I got an idea! To keep from catching a cold, I'm gonna eat something warm! $ENTITY Too bad you can't just open up a can of sunlight and make some sunlight soup, $ENTITY !
AN FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY So the sun not being out today doesn't necessarily make the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY the coldest day of the year. $ENTITY I guess the amount of daylight we get doesn't really have any bearing on how cold it is. So why is it so cold then? $ENTITY Dude!... Thinking about this stuff is gonna give me a fever, ...
