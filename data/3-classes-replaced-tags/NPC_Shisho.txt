NPC Shisho $ENTITY Come on now, $ENTITY you can't come in while I'm in the middle of clea... Ah!... . Mayor! It's just you! $ENTITY Thanks for all the help you gave me! $ENTITY Thanks to you, I was able to open up my very own live venue. $ENTITY I'm getting things set up at the moment, $ENTITY but we have some sort of music event going on every night!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Huh?!... Why would you come in here while I'm in the middle of cleaning?! $ENTITY Sorry... I guess I forgot to lock the entrance. $ENTITY This is a live venue, so our busy time is mostly in the evenings.
NPC Shisho And hey, since tonight is Saturday, $ENTITY we'll have a special LIVE concert starting at $ENTITY 8 p.m. $ENTITY ! You should come!
NPC Shisho Hey, starting at $ENTITY 8 p.m. $ENTITY tonight, we'll be mixing your favorite hits all night long $ENTITY during our DJ Party time!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY More importantly... What do you think of the place?... Isn't the stage amazing? $ENTITY I $ENTITY was actually pretty picky about how I wanted it to be... I spent a lot of money on it just to get it the way I like it!... It's really an amazing place, huh?... Would've been nice to perform on a stage like the one in here just once.
NPC Shisho $ENTITY You might not know this about me, but a long time ago, $ENTITY I used to get up and perform onstage too. $ENTITY Not as a musician, though. I was a COMEDIAN... I retired a while back, but even now, when I see a stage, $ENTITY I can feel it just calling to me. "Shruuuunk," it says!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY I suppose that's why even now I sometimes get the urge to share my old jokes with people! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Ah!... If you're interested, I wouldn't mind showing you my stuff during the afternoons when no one's here! $ENTITY I couldn't ask you to pay me, but $ENTITY I wouldn't turn down a nice treat! $ENTITY Any $ENTITY food $ENTITY pretty much works on me!
NPC Shisho So $ENTITY that's how we'll do this then!... Feel free to stop by anytime.
NPC Shisho ... we're not open for the day yet.... Is there $ENTITY something you needed? $ENTITY I brought a snack! Just dropping by.
NPC Shisho It's still quite a bit until we open for the night, but... Did $ENTITY you perhaps need something from me? $ENTITY I brought some food! Just dropping by.
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you don't say?... Hey, starting at $ENTITY 8 p.m. $ENTITY tonight is DJ night!... Check it out!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you don't say?... By the way, we'll be hosting a live concert starting at $ENTITY 8 p.m. $ENTITY tonight. $ENTITY We only hold them once a week, $ENTITY so don't miss out!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Oh, you don't say? $ENTITY What a shame. My tummy was sort of hoping you brought it something... $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho $ENTITY I see! I see!... Well, just having you drop by to see how I'm doing makes me really happy!
NPC Shisho I'm just in the middle of cleaning, so there really isn't much to see, but $ENTITY take your time and look around.
NPC Shisho ... really?!... That makes me so happy!... What did you bring me?
NPC Shisho .... What?! $ENTITY I thought you said you brought me a snack! $ENTITY I got my hopes up and everything. $ENTITY That stinks... .
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Oh!... What do we have here?
NPC Shisho ... Don't mind if I do!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY That was quite satisfying!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Well, thanks a bunch! $ENTITY I should probably return the favor now, $ENTITY shouldn't I?
NPC Shisho $ENTITY AH!... I LOVE these so much!... Yum yum! $ENTITY Time to snack!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Mmmm ... .... MMMMMMM YUM! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Oh my goodness, thanks a bunch!... Now I need to thank you since you gave me such a delicious treat! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho .... that's right!... I promised to show you one of my old jokes, didn't I? $ENTITY I guess if there's anything I can do to make you happy, $ENTITY that'd be IT! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Hmmmmm... Then how about I tell you a really good joke today!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY All right!... I have to get ready first, $ENTITY so you just wait right here a sec!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY WHOA! THIS MANY?! $ENTITY Well, I'll be! $ENTITY You really went above and beyond! $ENTITY It would be rude not to accept, $ENTITY so I'll happily accept these as a snack for later!
NPC Shisho That was my $ENTITY Joke $ENTITY . $ENTITY What did you think of it? $ENTITY My comedic style is rather original. I mix a short story with a punch line to create a $ENTITY Reaction Joke $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I retired a while back, but I think my jokes are still relevant, $ENTITY so $ENTITY I'd love for you $ENTITY to try them out too! ... Say!... I'll give you something else too! You'll REALLY love this...
NPC Shisho This is a world-famous $ENTITY joke book... You should always keep it close and use it to record the jokes I tell you. Plus, $ENTITY you can press on the lower screen to use them whenever you feel like it. $ENTITY I have tons of other jokes to show you, $ENTITY so stop by often to see new ones to widen your comedic range! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho $ENTITY So? What did you think? $ENTITY I know you've heard it before, but the MORE you see it, $ENTITY the BETTER it gets, right? ... What? $ENTITY It doesn't?... see. $ENTITY Well, ummm... Either way, you should $ENTITY keep on using this joke!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY So? What did you think? $ENTITY I know you've heard it before, but the MORE you see it, $ENTITY the BETTER it gets, right? $ENTITY You've already got enough jokes to become a full-fledged comedian, so keep at it to polish your art!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY So, $ENTITY yeah, $ENTITY what do you think?... I think this is the first time you've seen my $ENTITY Joke $ENTITY ! Now you can add one more joke $ENTITY to your joke book!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Use that joke book of yours to bust out your " $ENTITY " ability and develop your comedic skills!
NPC Shisho Well... I guess that's all there is now that I've shown you every single one of my jokes! ... I've got an idea! $ENTITY To celebrate you becoming a full-fledged comedian, $ENTITY I'll give you one of my old suits!
NPC Shisho I might not have anything more to teach you, but come by whenever you like $ENTITY for a performance!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Thank you so soooo much! $ENTITY Now I need to do something to REALLY show my appreciation.
NPC Shisho If you want to see me perform, $ENTITY just sneak in here during the afternoon sometime!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY I want you to get out there, try out my jokes, and develop your skills as a full emotion comedian!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY I assume this is what it feels like to train an apprentice.... It's pretty fun! $ENTITY I could definitely get used to this!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY As long as you want to learn my jokes, I'll keep on teaching them to you! $ENTITY Get your funny bone ready!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY If you ever want to study my performances of HIGHLY polished comedic material, $ENTITY just drop in!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Thanks for the treat! $ENTITY I'll be waiting here... tomorrow and the next day and every day after!
NPC Shisho The concert is supposed to start at exactly $ENTITY 8 p.m. $ENTITY sharp... You understand we can't get things ready when customers are hanging around in the club, right? $ENTITY I hate to ask, $ENTITY but could you step outside for a moment and then come back in?
NPC Shisho It's time for the DJ show... You understand we can't get things ready when customers are inside the club, watching us, right? $ENTITY I hate to ask, but could you step outside and then come back in?... It'll JUST take a second!
NPC Shisho Um, $ENTITY it's time for me to sweep and wax the floors.... I hate to ask, but could I get you to step outside?
NPC Shisho $ENTITY It's time for me to close up for the day.... I hope that you'll come again tomorrow, though!
NPC Shisho Tonight $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY is putting on a superspecial acoustic show! $ENTITY I hope you really enjoy it!
NPC Shisho Oh, please be quiet during the performance! $ENTITY Hush now!
NPC Shisho If you want to talk to $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY , please do it when he's not playing a song!
NPC Shisho Tonight is party night with that snazzy doggie, $ENTITY DJ KK... Have yourself a good time!
NPC Shisho So? $ENTITY Feel like dancing? $ENTITY I hope you really just let your hair down and have a great time!
NPC Shisho I want you to get out there, show me your moves, and become ... #x0;e $ENTITY #x0; of the dance floor! Hop to it! Hey, you know how to dance, right? Just press any direction you want on !
NPC Shisho ... What's this? $ENTITY Looking at you more closely now, I can tell you're already carrying your own joke book! $ENTITY Well, I'll be! $ENTITY I guess you've also felt the call of the comedic stage!... Say! $ENTITY How about we do this? $ENTITY I wouldn't mind showing you my stuff during the afternoons when nothing's going on here! $ENTITY I couldn't ask you to pay me, but $ENTITY I wouldn't turn down a tasty snack now and then! $ENTITY Any $ENTITY food $ENTITY works for me!... I'm easy to please!
NPC Shisho $ENTITY Since I'm the owner of this joint, $ENTITY I'm usually here. $ENTITY I hope you come and check out our shows often! $ENTITY Putting that aside for the moment... What do you think of the place?... Isn't the stage just AMAZING? $ENTITY I was actually pretty picky about how I wanted it to look... Yup, it was kinda expensive, but it's worth it to have a stage so nice.... It's really quite an amazing place.... I would've loved to perform on a stage like the one in here... .
