KO FreeA Always You $ENTITY won't forget to get ready for $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , right?... Sounds like there's a type of headwear that'd be best to snag ahead of time.

KO FreeA Always $ENTITY Did you know the bowl is actually a very critical part of raising your bonsai tree? $ENTITY You need to make sure the bowl's aesthetics match the plant's. $ENTITY They actually recommend you use antiquated things to decorate. $ENTITY It's one of the biggest differences between bonsai and other such ornamental plants!... !

KO FreeA Always ... It was a special about a strange, new fashion style called "Reindeer Antlering"! Can you believe that? $ENTITY Nope, $ENTITY it wasn't even for the winter time. $ENTITY These people just get antlers attached to their heads. $ENTITY Weird. I mean, back in the day, $ENTITY I wore some things that made people raise their eyebrows, but... I guess I can finally understand how the adults felt about me back then! $ENTITY GAHAHA!... !

KO FreeA Always ... Heh heh! $ENTITY It's not like me to talk about that kind of thing, is it?... It just came spilling out!
KO FreeA Always $ENTITY When I was a kid, $ENTITY there was a girl in my neighborhood who'd cry when she saw empty cicada shells. $ENTITY I thought it'd be fun, so I gathered up a lot of those shells and told her they were a present. $ENTITY Boy, did she cry!...

KO FreeA Always $ENTITY You see, $ENTITY when I was a kid, I'd often gather up the leaves around my yard and then eat some sweet potatoes. $ENTITY See, those sweet potatoes were the reward my mom always gave me for getting chores done. $ENTITY Some days...

KO FreeA Always $ENTITY Ohhhhh! $ENTITY I got it!... You like wearing big ribbons and clothes that look like they were meant for royalty?
KO FreeA Always $ENTITY You see... I went to a family reunion recently, and some of the little ones were trying to teach me fashion. $ENTITY Little girls nowadays are so precocious!... !
KO FreeA Always $ENTITY Ohhhhh! $ENTITY I got it!... You curl your hair and use color contacts, yeah?
