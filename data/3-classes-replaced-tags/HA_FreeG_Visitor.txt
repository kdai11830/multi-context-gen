HA FreeG Visitor Hey, I wanna ask you a question. $ENTITY What sport is most popular in your town?... Soccer. Baseball. Tennis. Kendo. It's a secret.
HA FreeG Visitor This is out of the blue, but please let me know which exercise is most popular in your town! $ENTITY Push-ups. Crunches. Squats. Aerobics. Jogging.
HA FreeG Visitor ... Just between you and me, $ENTITY what do you think of this town? $ENTITY Seems cozy. Seems rough. I have no opinion.
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Are you enjoying sightseeing $ENTITY in $ENTITY ?
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh! Soccer, huh? That's a fun sport to play! $ENTITY I'd love to show you how amazing my trapping skills are! $ENTITY But I've got some injuries right now, and I'm not allowed to do much tricky stuff... Maybe next time!
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Of course it's baseball, right? $ENTITY I love that sharp sound when the bat hits the ball! $ENTITY That sound brings back good old memories from when I was a kid... Geez. I'm starting to sound like my dad now. $ENTITY .
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Tennis, huh? That's pretty classy! $ENTITY Serve! Volley! Smash! $ENTITY And that "thwock" sound the racket makes? Simply amazing, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;.
HA FreeG Visitor Oh! Kendo, huh? $ENTITY That's a sport that requires a ton of concentration!... I kinda like the smell of the protective gear, though.
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What?! What kind of mystery sport are you talking about?... #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;d $ENTITY e! Don't keep me in suspense! I wanna play it right now!
HA FreeG Visitor Oh really? Push-ups, huh? $ENTITY Toning your arms sure does make grocery shopping easy! $ENTITY When your mom asks you to carry a heavy bag, you'll be like, "No problem, Mom! I got this!" $ENTITY Not only that, but you'll end up toning your arms even more by handling those heavy grocery bags.
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Crunches are such a common type of exercise! Everyone can do them! $ENTITY Take me, for instance! I'm flexing my abs right now! $ENTITY Although, the downside of crunches is sometimes you feel a little bit of rumble in the ol' tummy... 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I've done a million squats! $ENTITY If you keep doing them, it gets harder and harder to keep going! $ENTITY So... in $ENTITY , everyone is doing squats all the time? $ENTITY That's amazing, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;! That probably looks really cool!
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Aerobics, huh? Those classes seem easy when you're watching, but it's kinda tough when you're doing it. $ENTITY One, $ENTITY two! $ENTITY One, $ENTITY two! $ENTITY It's almost ... rhythm! It must be awesome to get your workout done while having fun!
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I see! Jogging, huh? $ENTITY Does that mean you have an established jogging path in your town? $ENTITY I'd love to run around your town even just once,... !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Really? Do you really think this town seems like a nice place to live? $ENTITY Ha ha! I never thought about it, but maybe I live in a privileged town! $ENTITY 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What?! Are you serious?! $ENTITY Well, I kind of understand how people love their own town the most,... .
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY You seriously have nothing to say?!... You know, you should pay more attention when you walk around... 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Personally I recommend checking out the beach! $ENTITY Everyone should have a memory of a really good sunset, $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I highly recommend you relax by the river! It's really calming listening to the water flow... I'm always so impatient, but it even relaxes me! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor My favorite spot is right in front of the town hall! $ENTITY Sounds pretty geeky, right? $ENTITY Yeah, well, there's a lot of space there, so it's the perfect spot to exercise for all kinds of sports! With that much space, you can get your $ENTITY warm-up going! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY My favorite spot is the waterfall basin! $ENTITY I want to do some training under the waterfall! $ENTITY I'm just waiting for the right time to jump in there,... !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I wonder if those guys are OK... $ENTITY When I say "those guys," $ENTITY I'm talking about those guys from my old town!... I'm sure they're fine! They're probably OK. They're probably sad.
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY ! I hope you're not slacking off on your workouts just because I'm not around anymore!... #x0;( Haven't missed a day! I do them sometimes. I'm totally slacking.
HA FreeG Visitor Question: $ENTITY How much do you like working out? $ENTITY I hate it I love it
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY That's what I figured! $ENTITY I was worried that everyone would be down because I left, but... Ha ha! I guess I was worrying for nothing,... 
HA FreeG Visitor "OK" is such a... vague word! $ENTITY I'm guessing everyone is still living the laid-back lifestyle as always. I'm happy if that's the case! $ENTITY 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What?! Sad?! $ENTITY Maybe it's because I'm not there anymore and they're slacking off on their training... Hey, you should go get 'em fired up for me! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Uh-huh, uh-huh... I'm impressed to hear that! $ENTITY Of course, I never see you working out. $ENTITY So I guess I'll just have to take your word for it, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;!
HA FreeG Visitor I see... I guess that's just the way it goes, huh? $ENTITY When you lost me, you lost a great trainer! $ENTITY I don't blame you for not recovering from that,... .
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY So is this what happens when the best coach in the world leaves?! $ENTITY Well,... I kinda expected that. $ENTITY It's nobody's fault really... .
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What?! You really don't like it, huh? $ENTITY Well, I'm gonna try to help you change your mind. $ENTITY Just try to imagine your head on my super-toned body... See? You can't stop smiling now, can you?
HA FreeG Visitor Just a little, huh? Well, I'm gonna have to try to be a better influence on you! $ENTITY I mean, working out feels great!
HA FreeG Visitor So-so, huh? ... You just need the right food to get you motivated! You should try $ENTITY ! They're great!
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Sounds like you enjoy working out almost as much as I do! $ENTITY You're not trying to outdo me, are you, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;?
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Y- $ENTITY you're that into it?! $ENTITY Seems like I may have some serious competition... Think I'll go do some push-ups now! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Hey! Are you using the locker at the station? $ENTITY That locker is actually connected to the locker in your town. Did you know that? ... If you have things you wanna bring back from my town, stash 'em in the locker! $ENTITY That locker at the station can be very handy! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY 
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY has changed quite a bit since you left, $ENTITY don't you think?... #x0; Yup, I agree! Really?
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Heh heh! Right?... is making progress every single day! $ENTITY I hope you're having fun with your duties as a mayor in your town! $ENTITY !
HA FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Ohh... You think it hasn't changed? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY maybe you just see it the way you remember it from when you used to live here. $ENTITY You can come here anytime you want,... 
HA FreeG Visitor ... You're starting to look like a mayor! $ENTITY You seem to stand with more confidence than before!... No wonder you're the mayor of ... I, uh, have a whole new respect for you!
