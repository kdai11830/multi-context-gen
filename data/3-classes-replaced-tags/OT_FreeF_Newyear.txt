OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY I'm so excited about the new year, $ENTITY I could just... rawr! $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I haven't done that in a while, $ENTITY so I'm a little out of practice. ... RAWR! $ENTITY Is that better?

OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Whoever came up with the idea of a big holiday feast is a genius. $ENTITY You make one giant meal, $ENTITY and then you eat leftovers for days! $ENTITY It's a nice break at a busy time of year. $ENTITY Real pros like myself extend the break even further by living off of fruitcakes for weeks.
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY , $ENTITY it's so hard to stick to a healthy diet at this time of year. $ENTITY It doesn't matter whether you crave salty or sweet treats... they're all out there begging to be eaten. $ENTITY I suppose it all comes down to moderation. $ENTITY Enjoy your favorites in small amounts, $ENTITY and keep exercising. Of course, $ENTITY that's not as fun as splurging on $ENTITY and ... is it?
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Everyone knows about stuffing and cranberries and pumpkin pie and all those traditional holiday dishes. $ENTITY But if you've never feasted on crab at this time of year, $ENTITY you're really missing out! $ENTITY Give me a plate piled high with fresh crab and a dipping bowl of drawn butter, $ENTITY and I'll just melt. $ENTITY Then leave me alone for at least 12 hours, please.
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY When I wake up in the morning on the first day of the year, $ENTITY I always write down my dreams. $ENTITY Then I look back on them year after year. $ENTITY It's a really interesting way to journal my progress in life. $ENTITY Then I'll have that one year when I dream about skydiving with a grilled cheese sandwich for a parachute. $ENTITY Those kind of make the whole thing seem a tad less dignified.
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY OK,... I'm going to ask you a serious question, $ENTITY and I demand a serious answer. $ENTITY If I make a fruitcake for you, $ENTITY will you eat it? $ENTITY Yes, I love fruitcake. Ewww! No!
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You will? $ENTITY You promise you won't regift it? $ENTITY I'm so happy! $ENTITY I still can't believe that fruitcakes get such a bad rap. $ENTITY They're so yummy. Oh well.... More fruitcakes for us, $ENTITY I guess.
OT FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Well! $ENTITY Most people don't know this, $ENTITY but fruitcakes are actually delicious! $ENTITY If you change your mind, $ENTITY just let me know and I'll give you a taste. $ENTITY The first one's free.
