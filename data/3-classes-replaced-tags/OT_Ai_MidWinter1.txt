OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY good morning... I know,... . $ENTITY well, $ENTITY #xE; blah today. Can you blame me? $ENTITY The sun didn't bother to get up this morning, $ENTITY so my pep got popped,... .
OT Ai MidWinter1 Good morning, $ENTITY . Well, $ENTITY if you can really call it good. Or even morning. The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY has me a smidge down. $ENTITY There's not going to be ANY sun today,... ! I need a little sunlight to give me my morning jolt. $ENTITY Otherwise, $ENTITY I might fall back asleep!
OT Ai MidWinter1 OK,... . $ENTITY Get ready for my annual $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY cheer!... GOOD MORNING! $ENTITY I always kick today off like that. The sun won't show up. $ENTITY So I have to power through the day on my own.
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Happy solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY . You DO know the sun won't rise today, right? $ENTITY I knowit's hard to believe. It's $ENTITY o'clock and still dark. Life will be back to normal tomorrow.
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good day,... But it seems like night, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY And it's only $ENTITY o'clock. $ENTITY I've heard of springing forward an hour and falling back an hour, $ENTITY but today time just seems... stuck.
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hello $ENTITY , $ENTITY . I hate to break it to you, but the sun took a vacation today. $ENTITY Don't worry. It will be back tomorrow. But today is going to feel a lot like night, $ENTITY .
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good evening $ENTITY , $ENTITY . Or should I say... $ENTITY "cold evening"? $ENTITY The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY always makes things extra chilly around here,... .
OT Ai MidWinter1 You know, $ENTITY sometimes I'm told I can be a little cold. Sorry if that's ever the case, $ENTITY . But tonight? I'm cold. $ENTITY Really cold.... The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY and I are SO not on speaking terms.
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Ugh, $ENTITY . How much colder could this night BE,... The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY chases away the sun today, $ENTITY which makes everything $ENTITY #x4; $ENTITY yond $ENTITY cold! We'll all thaw out after it's all over, $ENTITY .
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good evening $ENTITY , $ENTITY . I can't believe you're out on such a cold solstice night. I'm not sure ANY of us have the right clothes, $ENTITY or fur, $ENTITY or scales, $ENTITY or whatever, $ENTITY to stay warm tonight.
OT Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY ... I'm frozen to the core. $ENTITY What are we doing outside in this cold weather? The solstice is always so absolutely freezing! I should know better, $ENTITY !
