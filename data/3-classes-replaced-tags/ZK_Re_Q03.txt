ZK Re Q03 I'm sorry, $ENTITY but could you dig out the $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY you buried the other day? $ENTITY After sending you to bury it, I just started to feel kind of silly... OK, you remember the place where you buried it, right?... This is a true test of our friendship,... !
ZK Re Q03 $ENTITY Hey, ... #x0; $ENTITY About that $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY from the other day... Could you dig it up for me? I had a second thought about it and realized it was somewhat odd... Sorry for saying it now, but... you're the only one who knows where it is! $ENTITY I'm counting on you, $ENTITY !
ZK Re Q03 About that $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY I asked you to bury the other day... I suddenly started to feel really embarrassed and wanted to dig it up myself,... . $ENTITY I thought I'd let you know because you helped me bury it, but I won't need your help digging it back up.
ZK Re Q03 $ENTITY About that $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY from the other day... $ENTITY I accidentally found it earlier, $ENTITY so I dug it up,... . I'm sorry for making you run around for me all the time...
