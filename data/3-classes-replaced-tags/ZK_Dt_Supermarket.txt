ZK Dt Supermarket $ENTITY I'm looking for something to put up against my wall.... Something that will fill in the empty spot in my soul.
ZK Dt Supermarket $ENTITY Oh my, $ENTITY you've seen how plebeian I am. $ENTITY Well, uh, a guy can't be the height of style at all times, can he?
ZK Dt Supermarket $ENTITY There's so much stuff here. $ENTITY It's kind of difficult to focus on one thing.
ZK Dt Supermarket Sometimes I come in here and get so distracted by all the shiny things that I forget why I first came in... 
ZK Dt Supermarket ... You know, I never see anybody wearing those snazzy roller shoes. $ENTITY Why is that, $ENTITY ?
