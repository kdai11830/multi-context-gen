NPC Gardening $ENTITY Come again!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Welcome!
NPC Gardening ... Oh! $ENTITY A first-timer!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Welcome! $ENTITY I sell flowers here. Nice, beautiful flowers, yes indeed! $ENTITY I also have $ENTITY saplings, tools, and many more things, $ENTITY so please do take your time and have a look around.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Ah!... Heya heya, if it isn't ... !
NPC Gardening Were you... $ENTITY perhaps a little surprised to see me here?... Ah, isn't this place simply happy? $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY said they were going to make their shop bigger, so I had them include me too. $ENTITY Since the shop is larger and all now, I thought I'd expand my inventory. $ENTITY Oh yes, $ENTITY I've also decided to start up a $ENTITY weed-pulling service... I've given this place a lot of, you could say, "power-ups," so I hope you really like the improvements!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Oh!... Heya heya,... I know this will seem real sudden, but today's the end of the line for my little shop here. $ENTITY I heard the supermarket next door starts construction tomorrow, so it seemed like pretty good timing! $ENTITY Anyway, if there's something you need, $ENTITY make sure you buy it today!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Ah!... Heya heya,... You might have already heard the news, but when T.I.Y. closes its doors tonight, it closes for good. $ENTITY That means today is the last day for the gardening corner too... If you need something, $ENTITY make sure to pick it up today!
NPC Gardening Oh, looks like it's time to close shop for the day.... Please come again once the gardening mood strikes!
NPC Gardening Let's see here. That's a happy ... Ah yes! Right! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Bells... Are you... Yes please! What is it? No, thanks.
NPC Gardening OK. That's all right.... Let me know if you change your happy little mind!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Wahoo! That makes me so happy!... Oops, $ENTITY #xE;it's $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY , so you're a bit short on cash...
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Wahoo! Happy!... Uh-oh, $ENTITY #xE;you haven't got any room in your pockets. Could you make space and come back?
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Wahoo! Thank you!
NPC Gardening ... So then, what will it be? $ENTITY Still interested in buying the $ENTITY I'll get it! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening If you get an $ENTITY axe $ENTITY , you can chop down trees. WHACK! $ENTITY Equip it in your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY window. Then face a tree and choppy $ENTITY chop by pressing to swing the axe.
NPC Gardening That's a $ENTITY watering can... Watering wilted flowers will perk them right up, making them produce much-needed color around town. $ENTITY Equip it in your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY window. Face a flower, and press . It really is that simple to water flowers!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY isn't something you'll plant outside. You actually display it inside your home!
NPC Gardening Oh, $ENTITY is a seedling that you'll plant outside. It's a low-lying shrub. $ENTITY Planting a variety of shrubs means you get to enjoy beautiful, happy flowers each and every season.
NPC Gardening Oh yes. You see, beautiful flowers will end up blooming from this $ENTITY . $ENTITY Just pull it out and plant it in the ground to grow a single bunch of flowers for the town to see!
NPC Gardening With $ENTITY , you can plant a happy new tree out in the town somewhere. $ENTITY All you have to do is choose it from your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY window to plant it, so it's really super easy! $ENTITY Oh, you do have to be careful not to plant it in the shade or too close to other trees as it won't grow then.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY What you have there is $ENTITY fertilizer $ENTITY for your flowers and fruit trees. $ENTITY Use your shovel to bury it next to trees and flowers you want to grow strong and happy, then leave it be! $ENTITY It makes growing pretty flowers and super-yummy fruit really easy!
NPC Gardening That is exactly what it looks like $ENTITY bamboo... Sure you can eat it, but my intent was to have it grown outside. $ENTITY All you have to do is plant it from your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY when you're outdoors, same as a tree. Easy! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY but you must be careful not to plant it too close to another tree or in the shade, or else it will die!
NPC Gardening It's exactly what it looks like. It's a $ENTITY persimmon... Sure, you can eat it, but my intent was to have it grown outside. $ENTITY All you have to do is plant it from your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY when you're outside, so it's easylike a tree! $ENTITY But $ENTITY you gotta be careful not to plant it too close to another tree or in the shade. $ENTITY Doing that will cause it to wither, and then it'll never grow up all big!
NPC Gardening ... Oh! Of course! $ENTITY You'd probably like to get to shopping!
NPC Gardening ... Oh, that's right!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY It's a $ENTITY silver can $ENTITY ! You can use it to water many plants at once. $ENTITY , you've bought a lot of flower seeds here... So use the watering can to help make those flowers nice and happy!
NPC Gardening It's a $ENTITY golden axe $ENTITY . It's so strong it won't break, no matter how many trees you chop down! $ENTITY Oh, but wait! $ENTITY I'm not trying to give you the suggestion to chop through a bunch of trees! $ENTITY , you've bought a lot of saplings from me... So use that axe wisely to make $ENTITY the most beautiful town this world has ever seen!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY It's a $ENTITY golden shovel $ENTITY ! If you use it when burying fertilizer, it makes it extra potent. Well worth the effort! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY , I know you've picked up more than your share of fertilizer from me... . $ENTITY So I hope you'll use that shovel to help make the flowers and trees around town as happy as can be!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Hold up, ... Your purchase today comes with a happy bonus!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY If you find something in the store you have questions about, $ENTITY please feel free to ask me.
NPC Gardening I change the selection of flowers and saplings daily, based on what sort of happiness I'm feeling. $ENTITY So, I certainly hope that you'll make some time every day to see what I have on display in the shop.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY I'm happiest when I'm just walking around town and happen upon a flower starting to bloom. Stunning!
NPC Gardening I sold out of every single thing I put on display today. $ENTITY I'm so happy there are others around here who share my love of pretty flowers and greenery!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY I'm going to do everything I can to finish all the weeding by tomorrow morning. Yes, no later. $ENTITY I hope that you'll take some time in the morning to admire what a happy, weed-free town we'll have.
NPC Gardening The shop! $ENTITY It's lovely, right?... And it's so packed with happy products! $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY said they were expanding the shop, so I had them make a happy little space for me! $ENTITY I've got a lot more floor space for new items, so come by often to see what sort of happy things I'll have!
NPC Gardening Yes,... Can I help you? $ENTITY Please weed! Just browsing!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You need someone to weed?... But, on my daily walk, I didn't see a single weed anywhere at all... . $ENTITY Don't worry so much, ... Today, $ENTITY is as beautiful as ever. Enjoy that happy sensation!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Weeding?... But I didn't see all that many weeds during my walk... Don't worry so much, ... Today, $ENTITY doesn't look like it's being overrun by weeds one bit, so worry not. Instead, be happy!
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Oh, you need someone to weed?... Yeah, I've seen a few sprouting up that do need to be taken care of! $ENTITY If you ask me today, I'll make sure that this town is clean and happy by early tomorrow morning! $ENTITY Taking a look at things, I'd say that $ENTITY 10,000 Bells $ENTITY ought to cover it. So, ... Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Oh, you need someone to weed?... Yes, I've seen them out there. $ENTITY I think it's time someone took care of 'em! $ENTITY If you ask me now, I can have this town happy once more by early tomorrow morning! $ENTITY Looking at the way things are, I'd say $ENTITY 20,000 Bells $ENTITY ought to cover it. So, ... Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Oh, you need someone to weed? $ENTITY It's getting pretty bad out there. High time someone did something... . $ENTITY But no worries!... If you ask me right now, I should have this town happy again by early tomorrow morning. $ENTITY It's going to be quite a bit of work though, so it will cost a grand total of $ENTITY 30,000 Bells $ENTITY . ... Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Oh, you need someone to weed! $ENTITY Ah, yes, I've noticed myself how bad it's getting out there lately... . $ENTITY But, if you ask me right now, I think I should be able to get it all nice and happy by early tomorrow morning. $ENTITY It's pretty bad though, so it's gonna cost ya $ENTITY 50,000 Bells $ENTITY . $ENTITY What do you say to my offer? $ENTITY Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY What?! You want someone to weed?... But this town has been taken over! It's like an unhappy jungle out there! ... #xE; if I do my best, I can restore the town's happiness by early morning. $ENTITY This is going to be a lot of work, so it's going to cost... $ENTITY 100,000 Bells $ENTITY ! ... Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY you come back with enough Bells, $ENTITY and I'll be willing to help you with your little weed problem.
NPC Gardening $ENTITY Roger that! $ENTITY I consider the job paid in full, so I'll make sure to get to the job as soon as we close for the day. $ENTITY I know it's an eyesore, but $ENTITY I'll make sure it's neat and tidy for you even before you wake up in the morning! $ENTITY Now THERE'S certainly something to look forward to, eh? Heh heh.
NPC Gardening I see.... Well then, come see me again if and when you change your mind.
