OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Ugh... so sleepy. $ENTITY But the $ENTITY fishing tournament $ENTITY starts so early. $ENTITY And I must win.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I see you're taking the $ENTITY fishing $ENTITY tournament $ENTITY as seriously as I am,... . Well, $ENTITY may the best fisherperson win!
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I hope one of the two of us wins the whole tournament today. $ENTITY I can see it now... both of us up there on the podium, $ENTITY basking in all the glory... 
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I'm sure you know how the $ENTITY fishing tournament $ENTITY works, $ENTITY but let me just give you a quick refresher. $ENTITY When you catch a fish, $ENTITY take it to $ENTITY Chip... He'll measure it and keep track of who's winning. $ENTITY I've heard you can even use fish you caught yesterday... 
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Let's all take a deep breath and relax. $ENTITY It's still early in the tourney. $ENTITY Just kidding $ENTITY GOGOGOGO!
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY watch where you're going,... . $ENTITY #xE;If you run like that near the water, $ENTITY you'll scare all the fish!
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY OK,... , $ENTITY we're not doing so well, $ENTITY but it's still early. $ENTITY We still have time. We can win this thing! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY In order to catch a fish, $ENTITY you have to THINK like a fish. $ENTITY If you find yourself SMELLING like a fish, $ENTITY then you've taken it too far.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I hope you're taking this tourney as seriously as I am.... It's on,... !
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I bet you didn't expect me to be so excited about a $ENTITY fishing tournament... . Well, $ENTITY I'm full of surprises.... !
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Think you can beat me out for that top spot on the podium? $ENTITY Think again, $ENTITY !
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY , $ENTITY it's been a long day. $ENTITY I've caught a whole lot of fish... All that's left is to see how they rank. $ENTITY I want one more big one to really make a splash before the competition ends.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY So $ENTITY how did you do today? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY aren't you confident? $ENTITY Good luck at the awards ceremony... 
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY It's crunch time,... ! $ENTITY Are you going to finish with a bang $ENTITY or a fizzle? $ENTITY Or some kind of combination of the two, $ENTITY like a "fwoooshBOOMhissss" kind of sound? I'm not even sure what that means. $ENTITY This is what 8 hours of fishing will do to your brain.
OT Ev Sakanaturi Attention, $ENTITY fish:... I am finished catching you for the day. $ENTITY You may now resume swimming freely.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Blue or red? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I'm just wondering what color to wear when I take first place at the awards ceremony.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Will it be awkward if I give an acceptance speech after winning first place in the tournament? $ENTITY , $ENTITY I guess we'll find out!
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY congrats, ... You really outdid yourself.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I may talk a little trash, $ENTITY but I also give credit where credit is due.... Great job today, $ENTITY !
OT Ev Sakanaturi ... I knew you'd be tough to beat. $ENTITY Well done!
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY You've done well for yourself today,... Not as well as I, $ENTITY of course, $ENTITY but not bad.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY if we learned anything today, $ENTITY it's that we're both pretty good at fishing. $ENTITY And if we learned anything else, $ENTITY it's that I am slightly better at fishing than you. $ENTITY Good game,... !
OT Ev Sakanaturi Look at that $ENTITY we both finished in the top three! $ENTITY Oh! ... I hadn't even noticed.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Better luck next time,... I know you'll make the podium soon if you keep practicing.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you didn't make the top three? $ENTITY I guess the competition was pretty tough. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY keep practicing. $ENTITY You'll get there.... !
OT Ev Sakanaturi Don't worry $ENTITY you'll have more chances to win this tournament. $ENTITY All it takes is a little hard work. $ENTITY Or natural talent. $ENTITY Either one, $ENTITY really.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY So $ENTITY what did you think of the awards ceremony? $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You didn't even go? $ENTITY I can't believe you missed it.... Wouldn't you want people to come and cheer for you if you won?
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY So $ENTITY how did all the tournament winners look up there on the podium? $ENTITY , $ENTITY you skipped the presentation? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY look who's too cool for school.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY If you finish in one of the top three spots in this tournament, $ENTITY you make the podium. $ENTITY And that means you have to look good. $ENTITY Which is kind of a trick after 10 hours of fishing, $ENTITY let me tell you.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY There's something about the people who win this tournament that's so remarkable... Oh yeah, $ENTITY they all smell like sea bass.
OT Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I heard that the awards ceremony for the $ENTITY fishing tournament $ENTITY was canceled! $ENTITY I wonder if I made the top three... 
OT Ev Sakanaturi So I guess the awards ceremony was canceled.... , $ENTITY that's weird. $ENTITY Oh well. $ENTITY That just means more time for $ENTITY .
OT Ev Sakanaturi This is just a bit more fishing than I bargained for... 
OT Ev Sakanaturi Sorry. $ENTITY I've got to stay focused on my fishing right now. $ENTITY #x5;Focus, ...
