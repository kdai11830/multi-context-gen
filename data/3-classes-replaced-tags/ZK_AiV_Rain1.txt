ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY No way... ... I can't believe that you came in the rain to visit, especially THIS early.
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY You're here, $ENTITY ? You must really be a rainy-day person to come all this way, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY welcome to rainy $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY rainy-day hello, $ENTITY !
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY . I didn't know you'd be coming out here, $ENTITY and on such a rainy night. &#xF;
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY . So, come to visit $ENTITY on a dark and stormy night, huh?
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY ! Traveling at night? In the rain?... Pretty cool, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Hey, it's you! $ENTITY Crazy hour for a visit. Even crazier weather. $ENTITY Whatever, though. $ENTITY It's just good to see you.
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Meeting in the rain like this... $ENTITY What would you call it...? $ENTITY Oh yeah. $ENTITY Pretty slick.
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY You know, I live for rainy days. Every raindrop is like a sip of $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
ZK AiV Rain1 Not a big fan of the rain myself. My style gets soaked to the core. Ruins my day, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Did you come through the storm to visit me? Hope I'm worth all that trouble, $ENTITY !
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Not too much we can do about this crummy weather, $ENTITY but I hope you enjoy yourself here anyway.
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY Thanks for coming out to see us in this awful shower, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 Watch out for all the mud, OK? $ENTITY Wouldn't want you to slip and hate $ENTITY forever.
ZK AiV Rain1 Good thing $ENTITY is still pretty great on a crummy night like this, right, ... !
ZK AiV Rain1 Just watch your step out there. Dark plus wet sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV Rain1 $ENTITY I bet you'll see $ENTITY in a new way after this. $ENTITY Dark. $ENTITY Wet. $ENTITY And muddy, $ENTITY .
