NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY well, hello there! $ENTITY I've been selling turnips here on Sunday morns for 'bout 60 years now. $ENTITY Maybe even more! $ENTITY Come to think of it, I forget just how long... $ENTITY No matter! For turnips, come see ol' Sow $ENTITY Joan $ENTITY !
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh dear. Business can wait, though. $ENTITY First $ENTITY you could probably use a quick lesson in turnips... Want to hear it, $ENTITY kiddo? $ENTITY Yeah, tell me! I already know.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh, is that so?... Well, thank goodness for that! $ENTITY To be honest, teaching everybody the basics gets old faster than a batch of turnips!... Hyeh heh heh... .
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Probably for the best! $ENTITY Teaching everybody the basics so often can really do a number on you, kiddo!
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Hmmm. $ENTITY Let's see... Well, the first thing you gotta understand is that, yes, these turnips are of course edible... But it's been out of style to eat 'em for close to 30-odd years now, $ENTITY so no one does!... Nope, $ENTITY these days turnips are all used for turning a profit. And that's why they're called TURN-ips! ... Do you wanna hear more? $ENTITY You bet! No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY You know about that recycle shop in town, $ENTITY Re-Tail... You can sell your turnips there. $ENTITY The price of turnips will go up and down every day, though. $ENTITY So selling them for more than you paid $ENTITY nets you a profit. $ENTITY Needless to say, $ENTITY selling them when the price is lower $ENTITY only means you wasted some Bells. .... You still wanna hear more? $ENTITY Yup! No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY What I'm about to tell you is very important. Vital, even... These turnips will rot after one week. That's it. Just one. $ENTITY Also, turnips are very sensitive to time paradoxes, so any shift in time will kill 'em in an instant. $ENTITY I come to sell turnips every Sunday, so unless you sell all your turnips before $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY closes on Saturday... $ENTITY You're looking at a total turnip loss!... Be mindful of all your turnips if you want success in the stalk market. ... Oh my, see? I tend to go on and on once I get started talking about turnips. Old habits, I suppose.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY So anyway, today $ENTITY the asking price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY per turnip. $ENTITY What do you think, kiddo? $ENTITY I'm buying! Explain turnips. No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh my. $ENTITY Well, that's too bad... Maybe next time.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY I brought a bushel of ripe, fresh turnips today. $ENTITY The asking price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY per turnip. $ENTITY What do you think, kiddo? $ENTITY I'm buying! Explain turnips. No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Well now, $ENTITY my wee radish is back! $ENTITY The asking price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY today. $ENTITY You decide you want some, kiddo? $ENTITY I'm buying! Explain turnips. No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY My little customer is back!... The asking price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY today. $ENTITY Did you want some more, kiddo? $ENTITY I'm buying! Explain turnips. No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Are you ready? $ENTITY I'm going to explain it in one go. $ENTITY Listen real carefully, OK? The first thing you gotta understand is that these turnips are, of course, edible... But it's a fact no one here actually buys these things for eating... No, that'd just be silly. $ENTITY Everyone uses these turnips to make a profit in the stalk market. $ENTITY Hmmm. What else... Right. You know about $ENTITY Re-Tail... You can sell your turnips there. The price of turnips will go up and down every day. Very fickle. $ENTITY So selling them when the price is higher than what you bought them for? $ENTITY That gives you a profit. $ENTITY On the other hand, $ENTITY selling them when the price is lower $ENTITY will net you a loss. Very tricky sometimes.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY What I'm about to tell you is also very important... These turnips have a shelf life of one week. After that, they rot. $ENTITY Oh, and turnips are very sensitive to time paradoxes, so if the clock changes, they'll die instantly. $ENTITY I come to sell turnips every Sunday, so unless you sell all your turnips before $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY closes on Saturday... $ENTITY Well, you're looking at a big loss!... Just be mindful of all your turnips.... Oh, see? I tend to go on and on once I get started talking turnips.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY And so $ENTITY today's asking price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY per turnip. $ENTITY How about it, kiddo? $ENTITY I'm buying! Explain turnips. No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY OK then. $ENTITY How many do you want? $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY per turnip, and I sell them in bunches of 10.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh my. $ENTITY Well, that's too bad... Maybe next time.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Hyeh heh heh... Come again, kiddo!
NPC Kaburiba But my wee radish... . You have too many things. You can't carry the turnips. $ENTITY Why don't you come back after you've lightened your load, kiddo?
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY So $ENTITY turnips $ENTITY will come out to $ENTITY Bells... But it seems you're short on Bells.... Since you're short on Bells,... would you like to buy fewer turnips? $ENTITY I'll do that! No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY Oh dear, $ENTITY my wee radish... I'm glad you want so many, but it looks like you can't carry them all. $ENTITY How about $ENTITY you buy fewer turnips? $ENTITY I'll do that! No, thanks.
NPC Kaburiba $ENTITY So $ENTITY turnips $ENTITY comes out to be... Bells $ENTITY altogether. Do you wanna $ENTITY buy them? $ENTITY I'm buying! I'll pass.
