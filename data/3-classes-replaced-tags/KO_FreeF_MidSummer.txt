KO FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY When we go from spring to summer, the days get warmer and warmer... Then the season kicks it up a notch at the $ENTITY Summer Solstice... If you're not a fan of heat, $ENTITY man, $ENTITY these next few months are gonna be brutal! $ENTITY That sun'll melt your face if you're not careful, so you'd better be careful!... GAHAHA!
KO FreeF MidSummer Once we hit the $ENTITY Summer Solstice... that's when I can really slip into the summer mind-set! $ENTITY Make sure the heat doesn't wear you out, though,... !
KO FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY "The longest day of the year." $ENTITY When I was a kid, $ENTITY hearing that would really get me fired up!... Doesn't it make it sound like you can play even longer than normal? $ENTITY Nowadays... the first thought that runs through my head is, "It's really hot outside!" $ENTITY Awwww man, $ENTITY just listen to me! $ENTITY I've become one of those good-for- nothing adults!... 
KO FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY They say the sun will be up all day long, but that doesn't really affect me much. $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY left to my own devices, I'd just be sleeping!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF MidSummer $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY doesn't today seem especially humid to you?... Is it because the day is longer? $ENTITY Man, I suppose I shouldn't just point blame at good ol' Mr. Sun all day! That won't help!... !
