AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY #x0;
AN FreeB ItemP ... #x0;7
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hey! You make me nervous when you come up to me with an axe!... Or maybe that's not considered rude in this town? $ENTITY Chopping down trees is a big part of life here. So maybe it's OK to chat with axe in hand, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hmmm... You look like you'd be good with a slingshot. $ENTITY I can tell just by the way you hold it, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY That popper you're carrying makes me curious... Is there a party going on somewhere?... If people are getting down, let me in on the fun! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh, hey! $ENTITY That's bubble-blowing goo you've got there, right? $ENTITY Bubble blowing sure is fun... But have you ever tried bubble sucking? It's really fun too! You should try it! $ENTITY Haha! Naw, I'm just kidding!... When I was little, my friend tricked me into doing that! $ENTITY It was traumatic! I was blowing bubbles out my nose for days! ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hey, a pinwheel! $ENTITY I've always thought there must be a way to fly with those things! $ENTITY We should find someone really fast to try it for us... or someone who can blow real hard! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY What's with the fireworks? $ENTITY Do you have leftovers from some event? $ENTITY It's kinda fun to set them off for no reason! $ENTITY !

AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh, I get ya!... Yeah, you seem like you'd be good at that sorta thing! $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY There's nothing like a muscle-bound dude when he's using a shovel... You should really play that up!
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY A lady working hard with her shovel, sweat on her brow... You're so cool!
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Whatever you do, give it all you've got out there, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY Just be careful, OK?... Some of the rocks in this town are super hard. Hit 'em wrong, and BIZZZAANG!! Your arm will go all wiggly. $ENTITY Trust me. I did that a little while ago, and my arm is still kinda numb! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Holes?! $ENTITY But... if you have a shovel, aren't those potentially everywhere? $ENTITY Like... everywhere?! $ENTITY Way to set your sights real high... I don't really get it, but you seem into it!... So good luck, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Whoa! Haha! $ENTITY Mysterious! $ENTITY What kinda secret can you find with a shovel?! $ENTITY Be careful not to hurt yourself, I guess! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hold on a minute... Are you bug hunting? $ENTITY Sure am! I'm done already! It's a secret!
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh, OK! $ENTITY Just make sure you're not going after the same bug as I am! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Great! $ENTITY I mean, if we were going after the same bugs, we'd be rivals! And that could get dicey! $ENTITY Today I wanna keep things between me and the bugs... Mano a buggo.
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY What are you gonna catch with that net then?! $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Are you on some kinda... secret mayoral mission? $ENTITY Wow. What a hero. $ENTITY Long live Mayor $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Are you on some kinda secret mission for Mayor ... Well, good luck then! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Everyone in this town is into bug hunting! $ENTITY So how come some of us are good at it and others... aren't? I mean, we're all doing the same basic thing, right? $ENTITY ?
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Attakid!... The main thing to catch in $ENTITY would be... urrrgle...... Heh heh... Aw, man!... Talking about fish is making me hungry! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hey, good idea!... Getting your $ENTITY fishing skills up is going to pay off in a big way, I bet! $ENTITY You're the $ENTITY fishing ... #x0;e $ENTITY #x0;! ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Come on, $ENTITY . No need to get all humble... No one's gonna get mad at you for catching too much. $ENTITY Just say so if you're catching a ton, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh, you seem a bit disappointed... Fishing's just so-so, huh? $ENTITY Don't look so down! $ENTITY Everyone has his or her pace, ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hmmm... Maybe you're about to get lucky! $ENTITY Keep at it! $ENTITY When you catch a whopper, I'll be happy to help you celebrate! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Aw, man! $ENTITY No need to get all humble! $ENTITY Oh... you're serious. You really haven't caught much. $ENTITY Dude, now I just feel sorry for you! ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Aw, don't sweat it, man! $ENTITY I can see by your determined look you're doing pretty well! $ENTITY Keep it up! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Oh, come on! $ENTITY You're not kidding anyone!... I can tell just by looking at you that you're doing great! $ENTITY You're catching fish like crazy, so go ahead and brag! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Wow, I like your watering can! $ENTITY It looks so easy to use! $ENTITY The more you use a watering can, the better it fits your hand. And the watering gets easier, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hey! Your watering can... looks a lot like mine! $ENTITY Of course, I guess this is the only kind available in town, so it makes sense. ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Huh.... Is that a sun umbrella? $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY I don't know if you're trying to start a new trend or what. $ENTITY But you stand out carrying that on a sunny day!
AN FreeB ItemP Are you trying to protect yourself from the elements? $ENTITY I'm actually kinda worried about the elements, too... I could learn something from you!
AN FreeB ItemP What's up with the umbrella? $ENTITY Is it supposed to rain? $ENTITY Aw, lame! $ENTITY At least you're prepared, $ENTITY ! ... 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Even when you've seen someone a million times, seeing them with an umbrella gives them a certain glow! $ENTITY Probably... because their face is half hidden! Hahaha! $ENTITY 
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY I've never needed an umbrella, being the natural water-loving type. But I think I'd like to try one on for size!
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY I guess we all need to prepare for the unknown... But we can certainly be fashionable about it!
AN FreeB ItemP $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Isn't there sometimes real light snow that you don't need an umbrella for? $ENTITY Light, fluffy snow? $ENTITY Apparently you only see it on really cold days, though. $ENTITY !
AN FreeB ItemP Hey, what's with the umbrella?... You worried about getting covered in flower petals? $ENTITY Hahaha! I don't think you can ward off a cherry-blossom blizzard with an umbrella! $ENTITY And why would you want to? Just enjoy it! $ENTITY !
