NPC Cafe Grace It's so important in fashion to mix things up. A striped blouse and a bold tie? $ENTITY Go ahead $ENTITY mix it up! Same thing with coffee, darling. That's why I always go for this caf's fabulous $ENTITY blend $ENTITY . $ENTITY What a mix!
NPC Cafe Grace $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY brews such delicioso coffee. But some fools absolutely ruin it with unnecessary add-ins! One mustn't disrupt this delish flavor and mahogany color with something as pedestrian as milk. You'd $ENTITY never $ENTITY find moi putting milk in my coffee, honey. $ENTITY It would be an insult to good taste!
NPC Cafe Grace My palette is stylishly sensitive, so I adore the tangy bitterness of a good, $ENTITY strong cup of coffee. Why would anyone ruin that with $ENTITY ugh! $ENTITY sugar? I'd $ENTITY never $ENTITY add a single granule of the stuff to mine!

NPC Cafe Grace You again? $ENTITY Did you not hear me the first time? $ENTITY I'm in no mood to sign autographs or pose for photos!
NPC Cafe Grace You again? $ENTITY Honey, you've got to stop stalking me like this. No one likes a pushy $ENTITY #x12; $ENTITY #x0;p $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;p $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;a!
NPC Cafe Grace You again? $ENTITY I'm enjoying my private time. But if you have to sit here, $ENTITY leave an open seat between us, OK?
NPC Cafe Grace Why am I not surprised to see you here? You must know my schedule inside and out!
NPC Cafe Grace Why am I not surprised to see you here? You must've known that I needed my daily cup of java!
NPC Cafe Grace Why am I not surprised to see you here? You must absolutely LIVE for chatting with me. $ENTITY I'm flattered!
NPC Cafe Grace It's a well-known fact amongst us creative types $ENTITY that the rich aroma of coffee stimulates the brain. Whenever I experience fashion designer's block, I settle in here at $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's for a cup of java. And $ENTITY BOOM! $ENTITY The creative juices start flowing again. What a miracle concoction!
NPC Cafe Grace I wish I could spend all day sitting here, sipping coffee and chatting about style with you. But I really should head back to work after this. $ENTITY My new fashion line isn't going to design itself!
NPC Cafe Grace $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , darling! Any chance you'll add a convenient $ENTITY drive-through to your fine establishment?
NPC Cafe Grace $ENTITY Well... No.

NPC Cafe Grace The men of today are so much more fashionable than those from the previous generation. That's why I've been pouring my heart and soul into Gracie Homme, my line of stylish menswear. Swing by my boutique soon to check out the offerings. You never know what might catch your eye!
NPC Cafe Grace Have you heard? $ENTITY My ladies' line has stylish items that can be worn by both the ladies and the gents. Why should girls get to have all the fun? $ENTITY Swing by my boutique and we'll outfit you up, honey.
NPC Cafe Grace It's been said that I'm rather harsh on the ladies, but it's only because I expect so much from them! If I don't tell them they're being unfashionable, who will? $ENTITY I'm doing them a favor, honey!
NPC Cafe Grace My designs are as flattering to the ladies as they are to the gents, or so I hear... But the true strength behind my brand is Gracie Femme, my line of ladies' wear. Everyone associates Gracie Femme with haute couture. That's a lot to live up to, honey!
NPC Cafe Grace There's a reason why name-brand fashion is pricier than the rags you'd find at a garage sale. My customers are shelling out the big Bells for the Gracie name and the Gracie way of life! And Gracie quality, $ENTITY of course. It wouldn't do to fail in the quality department!
NPC Cafe Grace There's a silly belief in the fashion world that high price always means high quality. No way, honey! But there's something to be said for spending a few more Bells on an item you know is going to last.
NPC Cafe Grace I don't know if this tasty bit of gossip has reached $ENTITY yet, but $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY has two sisters! One older and one younger. They must make quite the trio. $ENTITY And now they're all working together! $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY had to quit her job at my boutique, $ENTITY but it was all to follow her dreams. C'est la vie!
NPC Cafe Grace You've heard of $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY from the tailor's shop, haven't you? $ENTITY It would be hard to forget a girl like her! Thanks in part to her ultratrendy name, which yours truly bestowed on her. $ENTITY You're welcome,... Labelle $ENTITY ! Now that she's back here in her hometown, I thought for sure she'd go back to using her original name. But " $ENTITY Label $ENTITY " doesn't have quite the same ring to it, now does it?
NPC Cafe Grace Le sigh! $ENTITY I don't mean to complain, $ENTITY but things haven't been all peaches and cream since $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY quit. I should be focusing on creative control, not obnoxious customers and overdue invoices. $ENTITY B... oring! Nonetheless, $ENTITY I wish her well in her new endeavor. She's going to make a big name for herself one day! You should try to hitch a ride on that shooting star, $ENTITY honey.
