AN FreeF 0229 I just realized that February 29th only comes during leap years! $ENTITY A day this rare should probably be a bigger deal. $ENTITY There should be, like, a leap festival or something! $ENTITY Gah! We're not ready!
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY A normal year has 365 days, right? $ENTITY And this year is a leap year, so it has 366 days! $ENTITY Talking about it gets me super excited about time and space and stuff like that! $ENTITY 
AN FreeF 0229 ... Live every leap day like it's your last leap day! Yeah! $ENTITY !
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY Heh. Talking about all this sciencey stuff makes me feel super smart! $ENTITY !
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY Leap years are famous for having an extra day. $ENTITY But do you know why there's an extra day? $ENTITY We divide a year into an even 365 days, but a year is actually more like 365.25 days long. $ENTITY So those leftover quarter days build until we have one full extra day every fourth year! $ENTITY It's like we're saving up bonus points to buy an extra day! Kinda cool, huh? $ENTITY !
AN FreeF 0229 Ack! It's a leap year! $ENTITY And of course I'm totally unprepared. But what is there to do, really?
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY It's cool that leap days only come once every four years, but that's pretty much all there is to 'em!
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY I guess I should have started planning something four years ago. $ENTITY !
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY Maybe I'll start working on some stuff to do for the leap day that happens four years from now... 
AN FreeF 0229 $ENTITY It's not like other events where everyone buys clothes and presents and bakes cookies, ...
