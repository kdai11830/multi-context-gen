GE 3P Bo $ENTITY You know how I get tons of fan mail, right? $ENTITY Well, I just got this really sweet letter in the mail... $ENTITY It went on and on about how great I am, $ENTITY but there was no signature! $ENTITY Was it from you, $ENTITY ?
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Me?! $ENTITY That doesn't sound like $ENTITY something I would do...
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Are you sure? $ENTITY It really sounded like something you would write to me. $ENTITY It was so flattering!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY 
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Well, I guess I am a pretty good writer. $ENTITY But I wouldn't know the first thing $ENTITY about how to flatter!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Flattering, huh? $ENTITY Like when I tell my... that it's really yummy $ENTITY and I love it a lot?
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY I did write a fan letter once. $ENTITY But it was to this fabulous food artist who made amazing $ENTITY !
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Ugh! $ENTITY Never mind. $ENTITY It must've been from one of my other loyal fans.
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess that's a start. $ENTITY You're obviously very sentimental about your nom-noms...
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY But you wouldn't write a fan letter to the most talented pop star in town?!... Sheesh!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY You're so fit, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY How do you stay so healthy when all I ever see you do is EAT?!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY I can eat whatever I want because I exercise a whole lot.
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Really?! I have $ENTITY GOT to hear about this exercise routine of yours...
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY 
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY It's pretty easy, actually. Whenever I sit down for dinner, $ENTITY I do a bunch of reps with my fork and knife. $ENTITY It's a good workout, $ENTITY and it really builds up my appetite!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY It's the easiest workout in the world. $ENTITY I like to juggle apples! $ENTITY I can keep three in the air at once! $ENTITY And every time an apple passes by my mouth, I take a bite of it. $ENTITY Really builds up your arm muscles!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY I suppose I could let you in on my secret. $ENTITY I do a lot of weight lifting! $ENTITY I pick up some $ENTITY ... $ENTITY then I bring it up to my mouth $ENTITY and take a big bite! $ENTITY It's a great workout.
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY 
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY HA $ENTITY HA $ENTITY HA! $ENTITY That totally sounds like the kind of exercise routine I could really get into!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY But that's not real exercise!! $ENTITY Real exercise means you have to SWEAT!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Hey there, $ENTITY ! Nice timing! $ENTITY We were just talking about which season is best: summer or winter! $ENTITY What do you think, ... $ Definitely summer. Winter, no doubt!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Totally! $ENTITY Summer rocks $ENTITY 'cause the sun gets up early and goes to bed late, $ENTITY just like me!
GE 3P Bo ! $ENTITY #x0;
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY When I think of summer, I think of ice-cold watermelon. $ENTITY It's really refreshing, $ENTITY you know?
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY You know what's good to eat in the summer? $ENTITY Corn on the cob! It's easy to hold in one hand too!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY This may sound crazy, but I really like to eat hot soup in the summer. $ENTITY It somehow cools me off!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Totally! Winter's awesome because of all the snow. $ENTITY And I like being able to see my breath $ENTITY when I talk!
GE 3P Bo &amp; $ENTITY 
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Ice cream $ENTITY is especially icy in the winter, you know. $ENTITY And you can't eat hot ice cream. $ENTITY That's called soup!
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY I eat tons of shaved ice in the winter. $ENTITY Have you ever tried $ENTITY pine- needle syrup $ENTITY on your shaved ice?
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Winter is the best time for stew.... Hot, $ENTITY delicious stew, $ENTITY full of veggies and yummm...
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY Seriously? Is food, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY the $ENTITY ONLY thing you can talk about?
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY No way! Sometimes I like to talk about yummy things to drink too. $ENTITY Like $ENTITY 
GE 3P Bo $ENTITY UGH! Now I'm all hungry. $ENTITY Thanks a lot!
