FU Q03 Req $ENTITY I have a little favor to ask you.... and I have been working on a $ENTITY time-capsule $ENTITY project. $ENTITY I got one put together, $ENTITY but I've been having a hard time figuring out where to bury it. $ENTITY Since you're so decisive, $ENTITY how would you feel about burying it somewhere for me?... Sure! I can't.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Do you have a minute? $ENTITY Last week, $ENTITY I decided to create a $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY as a sort of gift for my future self. But I haven't buried it yet. $ENTITY Knowing me, $ENTITY I'll end up losing it, $ENTITY and I don't want that to happen! So do you think you could bury it for me? $ENTITY Please? $ENTITY Sure! I don't think so.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Sorry to spring this on you, but would you be interested in burying my $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY for me? If I bury it myself, $ENTITY I won't be able to resist the urge to dig it right back up. $ENTITY No problem! Sorry.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY Here it is.... I'll hand it to you now $ENTITY so you can keep it with your letters, OK?
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Do you really mean it? $ENTITY Well then, I leave my future in your capable hands. $ENTITY You can keep it with the rest of your letters for now. $ENTITY 
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Oh, that's great! $ENTITY I don't want you to lose it, $ENTITY so please keep it with your letters until you're ready to bury it.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY I see. $ENTITY Well, maybe some other time.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY It's in your pockets $ENTITY where you keep your letters. $ENTITY Make sure you bury it without peeking or anything!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY By the way, do you still have that time capsule? $ENTITY I've decided that since I made it, $ENTITY I should probably bury it myself. $ENTITY Can I please have it back?
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You lost it?! $ENTITY But I poured my heart and soul into it. $ENTITY I can't believe you,... .
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Wha?! $ENTITY Did you open the capsule, ... I understand you're curious, but that's pretty rude... 
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Sorry to take it back now after handing it over earlier.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Um... what's this?
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Don't tell me you opened it already! $ENTITY I was hoping we could look inside it together... What a shame. $ENTITY That was really inconsiderate of you.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You took it upon yourself to open it?!... And it's empty?! $ENTITY I was really looking forward to opening it together, $ENTITY but now I'm just really disappointed.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Ooh! Ooh! $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY Let's open it and take a look!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Aah! $ENTITY The $ENTITY I loved so much! $ENTITY And look! $ENTITY There's a letter inside too!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY My $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Such a favorite of mine!... Oh, there's a letter too!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Look! $ENTITY My ... I just thought I'd lost that,... Oh, and I wrote a letter! $ENTITY Shall we read it?
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY It's funny to look back on what I wrote, $ENTITY but it's also kind of embarrassing.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Oh, right! $ENTITY Let me thank you with a gift.... Please accept my $ENTITY !
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY And now let me give you a present!... I want you to have my $ENTITY .
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Right!... To repay you for helping me, $ENTITY I'll send a present to your house.... Thank you!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Thank you. $ENTITY I hope you'll help me again sometime!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Um, $ENTITY yes?
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY you found it for me! $ENTITY Thanks! $ENTITY I was just about to dig it up myself. $ENTITY Wait a second! $ENTITY Did you... Did you open it?... But... opening it would have been the best part.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You found it? $ENTITY Perfect timing. I was just going to go dig it up myself,... . $ENTITY But what's this? $ENTITY Did you open my capsule?! $ENTITY AND you took the stuff inside?! $ENTITY I can't believe this!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY You found it for me?!... You know, I was just thinking it was about time to dig that thing up. $ENTITY You know me so well, ... OK, $ENTITY let's open it up.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Yay! $ENTITY My ... Oh, $ENTITY and there's a letter!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY My ... What a great find!... Oh, $ENTITY and a letter... .
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY My ... Wow! $ENTITY And here I thought I'd lost all this. $ENTITY Oooh, $ENTITY and there's a letter too!... !
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY I completely forgot what I wrote in that letter. $ENTITY What a nice surprise.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY I'd like to repay you for finding it for me!... Please take my $ENTITY as a gift.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Now, since you were nice enough to find it for me,... I'd like to give you my $ENTITY . $ENTITY Here!
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Thank you so much for bringing my capsule to me! $ENTITY I want to repay the favor somehow, so I'll be sending a little present to your house.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Thank you again!
FU Q03 Req Hey! $ENTITY Did you open it?!... Now it can't be buried! $ENTITY Just give it back to me.
FU Q03 Req I can understand wanting to peek inside, but it's not right to snoop through people's stuff.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Did you lose what was inside the capsule?! $ENTITY I'm so disappointed.
FU Q03 Req $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY You opened the capsule?! $ENTITY And you lost what was inside?!... To think I trusted you,... .
