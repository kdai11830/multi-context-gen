OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY My idea of the perfect $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is a scary movie, $ENTITY a cozy blanket... and a mountain of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY !
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I'll dress up as a witch when I feel like it $ENTITY whether it's $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY or not!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY If you're looking for good costume ideas, $ENTITY take a look through all the old hats you own. $ENTITY Pick out a scary one! $ENTITY Me? $ENTITY I don't wear hats. $ENTITY They flatten my hair! $ENTITY That's why I'm at home giving out $ENTITY candy $ENTITY right now.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Piece of advice, $ENTITY : $ENTITY it's not a good day to walk around with your most prized possessions. $ENTITY I wouldn't even put on a favorite outfit... You never know what could happen! $ENTITY , $ENTITY who am I kidding. $ENTITY I always have to look my best.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY The secret to avoiding pranks on $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is to make sure you have plenty of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY on hand. $ENTITY Installing a sophisticated TP-sensing radar in your yard is also not a bad idea.... , I'm prepared!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Do you ever feel like $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is just a mad competition to see who can acquire the most $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I didn't say that was a BAD thing. $ENTITY !
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Things might get pretty freaky tonight in $ENTITY . Especially if you're scared of ghosts. Me... I'm not scared of ghosts. What's a ghost going to do? $ENTITY Wave some sheets at me? $ENTITY Boring.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I've seen a lot of people around $ENTITY dressed up like monsters tonight. $ENTITY I just don't find them scary. $ENTITY I see monsters as tragic figures... not horrible beasts. They're just sad weirdos shambling around in ill-fitting sport coats. $ENTITY I feel sorry for them.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY If you think you're going to scare me this $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , $ENTITY you've got another thing coming,... . $ENTITY The usual stuff doesn't work on me. $ENTITY Especially creepy-crawly stuff. $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY giant bugs just remind me of my garden.... Some of them are even helpful! $ENTITY How could they be scary?
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I can't help but laugh when I see people dressed up as werewolves for $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY . $ENTITY To me they just look like big, fuzzy puppies! $ENTITY Not slathering, bloodthirsty beasts. $ENTITY I just want to pet them on their cute, little heads. $ENTITY And let me tell you, werewolves do $ENTITY NOT $ENTITY like that.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY , mummy costumes are one of my biggest $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY pet peeves. I mean, $ENTITY really.... If I can't distinguish between your costume and a guy in traction, $ENTITY that's not good.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Dressing up as a skeleton for $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is such a weird idea. $ENTITY I mean, a skeleton is just basic anatomy.... I'm not sure how that's supposed to be scary. It's kind of like dressing up as a plant or household object. $ENTITY Ooh, I'm terrified.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY you got your $ENTITY candy $ENTITY now get moving. $ENTITY #xE;... I need some alone time... 
OT Ev HalloweenB Uh, $ENTITY hello? $ENTITY What are you still doing here? $ENTITY You loaded up on my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY , $ENTITY so now it's time for you to go.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY OK, you got my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY . $ENTITY Great job.... Now quit rubbing it in $ENTITY get out of here!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey, nice hat! $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You were hoping it would seem scary? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I'm sorry. $ENTITY It's just that it'll take a lot more than that to catch me off guard. $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY are you here to take my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY why don't we play a game for it? $ENTITY If you win, $ENTITY the $ENTITY candy $ENTITY is yours. $ENTITY But if I win... I get to play a trick on you!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY I know it's $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , $ENTITY but that hat you're wearing is just ridiculous. $ENTITY Is it supposed to be scary? $ENTITY No offense, $ENTITY but you'll have to try a lot harder than that to get a reaction out of me. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it's cute that you thought you could trick me into giving up my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY . So $ENTITY I'll give you a chance. $ENTITY We'll play a simple game. $ENTITY You win $ENTITY you get $ENTITY candy... I win $ENTITY I get to prank you!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Have you learned your lesson? $ENTITY I'm not scared of your silly hat.... !
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You came here to scare me, $ENTITY and I ended up scaring you instead. $ENTITY Isn't $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY great?... !
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Wh... what is that... THING... on your head? $ENTITY Gaaaah!... Stay away! $ENTITY Here $ENTITY take my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and just leave!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh no... .I can't believe it... NOOOO! $ENTITY Please, take this and get out of here! I can't stand looking at that thing another minute.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Wh... what is that... THING... on your head? $ENTITY Gaaaah!... Stay away! $ENTITY Here $ENTITY take my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and leave me alone! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY You don't even have any room in your pockets. ... just what do you think you're doing?
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Well? $ENTITY What are you still doing here? $ENTITY You got my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY now please get that horrible thing out of here!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY this isn't your favorite type of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY tough twinkles. $ENTITY I can't stand your hat. $ENTITY Get out!
OT Ev HalloweenB I'm only scared of two things: $ENTITY cockroaches... and that $ENTITY THING $ENTITY you were wearing on your head! $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY full disclosure. $ENTITY I'm not a big fan of scorpions or tarantulas either... 
OT Ev HalloweenB Oh, good $ENTITY you got rid of that awful costume. ... it was ugly!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Argh! $ENTITY You're still here with that hideous costume. $ENTITY Please $ENTITY just take this and leave me alone!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Argh! $ENTITY You're still here with that hideous costume. $ENTITY Please, $ENTITY just take this and leave me alone! Are you serious? $ENTITY You still don't have room?... ! I am so mad right now.
OT Ev HalloweenB Huh? $ENTITY Something isn't right. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it is $ENTITY Halloween... I guess a little weirdness is to be expected.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , $ENTITY ! How's tricks? $ENTITY I want some candy! Let's chat.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY ! Happy $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Are you getting into the spirit? $ENTITY Yes, and I want candy! I just want to chat.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Sorry,... . $ENTITY I need all this $ENTITY candy $ENTITY in case someone REALLY scary shows up.
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You think you can score my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY that easily? $ENTITY You didn't even try to dress up! ... it's $ENTITY Halloween... Get into the spirit a little bit, $ENTITY and try again... 
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I know it's $ENTITY Halloween... but this game is getting old. $ENTITY I've got scary movies to watch... so why don't you find someone else to pester!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You just don't know when to quit, $ENTITY do you? ... is it that important to scare me?
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY , $ENTITY this is gonna be fun! $ENTITY Let's play $ENTITY rock-paper-scissors... #x0;
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY My favorite game is ... harades... Let's get started! $ENTITY #x0;
OT Ev HalloweenB Let's get started! $ENTITY I think we should play $ENTITY Made Ya Look... #x0;
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh,... ! $ENTITY Here comes the pranking... 
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY since I'm the winner, $ENTITY and you're the, $ENTITY uh, $ENTITY non-winner, $ENTITY that means it's time for you to pay... 
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY , you beat me fair and square. I guess I owe you some $ENTITY candy... 
OT Ev HalloweenB Sigh... Good game. $ENTITY As promised, $ENTITY here's the $ENTITY candy $ENTITY I owe you. $ENTITY .
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Wait a second... You don't even have enough room to carry any $ENTITY candy... Well then! $ENTITY I'll just be keeping it, $ENTITY won't I? $ENTITY And we'll pretend this whole thing never happened. $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Awww... I'm gonna miss this $ENTITY candy $ENTITY so much... 
OT Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Well played. $ENTITY Actually, you did get pretty lucky. $ENTITY .
