FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Hi, ... Welcome back! $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY You're back! $ENTITY And it looks like you were successful. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Oh, good. $ENTITY I had a feeling you'd make it back soon. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY When you didn't come back, $ENTITY I thought something bad might have happened. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Did you need to speak with me about something,... 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY What can I do for you, $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY said you needed me for something, ... Well?
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY I know I've kept this for a long time, $ENTITY so I wanted to get it back to you as soon as possible. $ENTITY I hope I haven't caused you any trouble by holding on to it!
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY You haven't, $ENTITY and your concern for others is touching. $ENTITY It's so nice to see that in the young.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Your order of extra-extra-fancy ketchup arrived today, $ENTITY and they also sent you a free gift! $ENTITY Here you go!
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY How wonderful!... Thank you for your help.... will certainly come in handy.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY I found something near the station the other day that I think is yours. $ENTITY Am I right, $ENTITY ?
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY My ... I'm so relieved that you found my favorite heirloom! $ENTITY At the train station, $ENTITY you say? $ENTITY That's weird, $ENTITY I almost never go there. $ENTITY I suppose I just have too many important things on my mind. $ENTITY Oh well.... Thank you!
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY I hope I'm not bothering you, $ENTITY but I need your help. $ENTITY I've been invited to a fancy dinner party. $ENTITY But I don't know enough about manners or etiquette to not embarrass myself! $ENTITY So I was hoping you could teach me things like which fork to use, $ENTITY please.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY that should that be fun! $ENTITY Don't worry. $ENTITY I can teach you everything you need to know. Let's start with this: $ENTITY After the meal is over, $ENTITY thank your fellow diners for their company. Half the fun of dining out is pairing good food with good conversation. $ENTITY We'll talk more later. $ENTITY I know you'll do just fine!
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY It's just... . You have such a $ENTITY refined sense of style. $ENTITY I was hoping you could give me some pointers.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY That's quite a compliment! $ENTITY I'd be happy to share my wisdom with regard to style. $ENTITY Grace and refinement are as much about what's on the inside as what you wear on the outside. $ENTITY Don't worry, dear... I'm sure you'll understand when you're older.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY , $ENTITY thank you for joining us.... Until next time, ... Enjoy the rest of your day.
FU Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well then. $ENTITY This seems like a good place to wrap things up. $ENTITY , $ENTITY I'm sure I'll see you again soon.... thank you for your assistance. $ENTITY Good-bye!
FU Q04 3P_Ot ... thank you for escorting me.... I'm sure we'll see each other soon. $ENTITY Ta-ta!
