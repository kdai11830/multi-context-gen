ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I feel kind of like $ENTITY and $ENTITY are unusually close to each other. $ENTITY I wonder why they're so chatty lately... 
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY and $ENTITY are always together, aren't they? $ENTITY They seem like great friends, $ENTITY so maybe it'd be nice if they started a band together! $ENTITY And then perhaps I could come in... as their producer!
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY and $ENTITY have a pretty strong friendship, right? $ENTITY I can't explain it... They're acting kind of like they're best friends, you know? $ENTITY Hopefully you can find someone like that too!... Or perhaps... you already have someone like that?
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY Seeing the relationship between $ENTITY and $ENTITY reminds me of my past... When I was little, I used to be pretty mischievous with some of my guy friends... 
ZK FreeA Friend You know, $ENTITY and $ENTITY are always together, aren't they? $ENTITY I wonder what those two talk about when they hang out all the time. $ENTITY Don't you wonder, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Maybe they're talking about their best friends... Think they might have mentioned me?... Hah ha!
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY Guess what I saw! $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY and $ENTITY spending time together! $ENTITY They were sitting and drinking $ENTITY with one another... This must mean that their friendship is in good shape,... .
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I once heard that fighting is how friends stick together... Huh? $ENTITY I'm talking about $ENTITY and $ENTITY , OK? $ENTITY In a fit of anger, friends can see how their friendship actually holds up. $ENTITY Not everyone makes it, though... 
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY and $ENTITY are on bad terms... The other day, $ENTITY I saw them arguing so much that they didn't even realize I was listening. $ENTITY When you see two friends fighting, there's not a lot you can really do, huh, $ENTITY ?
ZK FreeA Friend ... did you hear? $ENTITY Just the other day, $ENTITY and $ENTITY had a huge fight. I guess the reason doesn't really matter... I just hate learning that friends aren't getting along!
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... What's your relationship with ... He's one of the few good friends I have! $ENTITY We're so close that he'd gladly give me the shirt off his back if I asked. Even in winter,... ! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY Don't misunderstand me, OK? $ENTITY It's not like I'd ever MAKE him do that!... At least not EVERY day... .
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... What do you think of $ENTITY but he's a super-nice guy at heart. $ENTITY Really,... I haven't seen $ENTITY but I still consider him one of my best friends!
ZK FreeA Friend Hey,... Are you getting along with $ENTITY Normally... I get along with him pretty well, $ENTITY but things are a bit awkward now. $ENTITY We're avoiding each other, $ENTITY but deep inside we still care for one another a whole lot... All I can say is, friendships aren't kept without a lot of hard work.
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... What's your relationship with $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY I guess... I'm just another one of his many friends?... ?
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... Are you getting along with ... ? $ENTITY I guess... I'm sort of neutral in my relationship with him. $ENTITY Still, $ENTITY I'd love to get the chance to get to know him better!
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY Listen, ... #x0; $ENTITY says my clothes are too small! $ENTITY He doesn't understand anything! $ENTITY Tight clothing is just "in" right now. $ENTITY Maybe I'd better keep my distance from $ENTITY for a while... 
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... Are you getting along well with $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY but we're still on good terms,... The trick to being good friends!... Just accepting that other people are gonna have different opinions!
ZK FreeA Friend Hey,... What's your relationship with ... ? $ENTITY She and I have our souls tied to one another. $ENTITY Yes, we're soul mates! $ENTITY Do you believe in such things? $ENTITY When you care about a best friend on a level past even that of cake... That's what $ENTITY is to me!
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... What's your relationship with ... ? $ENTITY She and I are good friends, but we're not exactly best friends, I guess?... I have no idea what $ENTITY thinks of me, though!
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I have a hard time understanding what girls are thinking... I was talking to $ENTITY the other day, $ENTITY but she got upset all of a sudden and I couldn't say anything... Though, I have to admit... she's kinda funny when she gets upset,... .
ZK FreeA Friend Hey, ... Are you getting along with $ENTITY she talks to me like I'm one of her gal pals! $ENTITY She's very kind,... . $ENTITY I guess she's kind of like a little sister to me. $ENTITY I have no idea what $ENTITY thinks about me, though... 
ZK FreeA Friend Hey,... Are you getting along with ... We're nothing more than casual acquaintances, so we just greet each other when we pass by. $ENTITY Hah ha! $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY but I'm shy sometimes! $ENTITY 
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I always thought $ENTITY was hard to talk to, $ENTITY but I didn't expect it'd be THAT hard... I gave her a bouquet the other day as a present, $ENTITY but she said she couldn't accept it and gave it back. $ENTITY Perhaps she's not mature enough to receive flowers... 
ZK FreeA Friend $ENTITY I don't get it... I don't understand $ENTITY 's feelings anymore... She said she hated me yesterday, $ENTITY but today she likes me. $ENTITY What'll she think tomorrow... ? I don't think I'll ever really get her. $ENTITY Not anytime soon anyway.
