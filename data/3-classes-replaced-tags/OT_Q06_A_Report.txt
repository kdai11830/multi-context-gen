OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you made the delivery? $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY . I hope $ENTITY liked what I sent over!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY so you made that delivery? $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY What did $ENTITY think, ... Here's the scoop... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Well, what did $ENTITY think? $ENTITY I can't wait to hear. $ENTITY It was so beautifully wrapped and all. $ENTITY Here's the truth... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report But that was the most important part! Well, $ENTITY for me! I'm so disappointed, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY No! $ENTITY You didn't REALLY open it, did you? $ENTITY After I wrapped it so nicely too, $ENTITY ?
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY No! $ENTITY You opened it? $ENTITY At least it went unnoticed. $ENTITY I don't want people thinking I send gifts without wrapping them, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, good, and $ENTITY tried it on too? $ENTITY I'll have to go over and see it for myself soon.
OT Q06 A_Report Oh! $ENTITY didn't try it on? $ENTITY Well, how rude. $ENTITY It's not like I expected $ENTITY to throw a parade, but I expected more than just.... nothing.
OT Q06 A_Report Oh no! $ENTITY didn't like it?... Well, that one CAN be so hard to please, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report Oh? $ENTITY didn't like it?... Well, that so-and-so is always too picky about this and that.
OT Q06 A_Report Really? $ENTITY didn't love or hate it? ... is always that way.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, I see! $ENTITY liked it?... Well, of course. I know $ENTITY like the back of my hand. $ENTITY Eeeeek! Is that a smudge of $ENTITY on my hand?... Get it off! Get it off! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY as I was saying.... I know what $ENTITY likes.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, really? $ENTITY liked it? $ENTITY I'm glad. $ENTITY all that well, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY actually liked it? $ENTITY What a relief. We're not close, so I wasn't sure I chose the right thing.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY You delivered my gift? $ENTITY Thank you! I hope $ENTITY liked it, so we can put our argument behind us.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, you delivered my gift! Thank you, $ENTITY . $ENTITY So how did $ENTITY take my little apology? $ENTITY Here's the scoop... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, so you delivered my gift? Well, what did $ENTITY It was so nicely wrapped and everything! $ENTITY Here's the truth... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report But that was so important to me! I'm so disappointed, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, that's what happened? $ENTITY Great. Now we can forget that little tiff we had, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY No! $ENTITY You didn't TRULY open it, did you, ... Every tiny detail was supposed to be absolutely perfect to smooth things over!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY No! $ENTITY You opened it? $ENTITY But at least that went unnoticed, ... That might seem like a small thing to you, but it's a huge breach of etiquette to me!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, so you made the delivery? Thanks, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report What a relief.... I finally don't have to worry about that anymore,... .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY So how did $ENTITY react? $ENTITY Here's the scoop... I can't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report What? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess that's what got ME in trouble in the first place.... I forgot I even borrowed anything!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY she was happy to get it back?... That's so $ENTITY She's even nice when I'm the one at fault!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY made fun of my gift- wrapping skills?... And she dresses like THAT? $ENTITY Ha!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY She was happy I returned it? $ENTITY I can't even begin to tell you what a relief that is. $ENTITY If anyone's going to hold a grudge about returning something late, it's $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY She was glad that I returned it?... That's music to my ears! Why, it's even $ENTITY music! $ENTITY I was scared she'd come over to my house and turn the place upside down looking for it!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY He said it smelled like flowers? $ENTITY Oh dear, $ENTITY I hope our friend $ENTITY doesn't have a little crush... 
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY was relieved to get it back, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Hmm. I wonder why.... I guess I'm relieved too. $ENTITY always treats my house like it's some kind of $ENTITY arena.... and makes SUCH a mess.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY He was happy that I wrapped it up nicely? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY of course I wrapped it! $ENTITY What kind of savage would return someone's possession without gift wrap and a handwritten note?
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY He was glad that I returned it? $ENTITY Oh, good. I was worried I'd get on $ENTITY 's bad side. You never know with $ENTITY .
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, did you make that delivery? So how did $ENTITY react? $ENTITY Here's the story... I can't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Really? You're going to wind up like $ENTITY if you're not careful forgetting where you leave things!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh no! Really? $ENTITY bought a replacement? $ENTITY I should have sent that over sooner.... 
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY So $ENTITY didn't even realize anything was lost? $ENTITY Well, I'm glad I returned it anyway.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, you finished that delivery? Thanks, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, you completed the delivery? Thank you, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report So what did $ENTITY say, ... Here's the story... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY What did $ENTITY say when you delivered that package, ... Here's the truth... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Tell me, what did $ENTITY say about it, ... Here's the story... I don't remember.
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY No! You opened it yourself?... How could you? It wasn't yours!
OT Q06 A_Report What? But I really wanted to know how that turned out, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report Seriously? But I really wanted to know how it turned out!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY What? It was a present for you all along? How bizarre!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Hmm. That's nice. So you got a reward and all, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Well, I see. Isn't that $ENTITY a strange one, winding up with two of the same thing!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY What? It was a gift for you? Well, I wish I'd known that!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Isn't that nice? So you got a reward and all, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY tried it on right away? $ENTITY Well, I should see how it looks on $ENTITY for myself!
OT Q06 A_Report $ENTITY So it wasn't a very fitting style? $ENTITY Hmm. I had a feeling that's how it would all turn out!
