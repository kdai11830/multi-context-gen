OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Oh, good. $ENTITY You're both here!
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Hey,... Thanks for tracking down $ENTITY for me.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY look who's back.... !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY that was extremely fast! $ENTITY No, $ENTITY wait.... It was the longest thing ever. $ENTITY What happened? Never mind. $ENTITY The important thing is that you found $ENTITY for me.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY I hope everything's OK.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY What's going on, $ENTITY 
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY What's this all about, ... was in such a rush to get me here... 
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it's not really that urgent. $ENTITY I just found something that I borrowed from you a while back. $ENTITY This is yours, $ENTITY right, ... #xE; It's been so long I can't even remember. $ENTITY Sorry about that!
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY that's right! $ENTITY I do remember lending this to you. $ENTITY I wasn't in any rush to get it back, $ENTITY but thank you for thinking of me.... !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I was out shopping, $ENTITY and I was in a generous mood... and I found something I thought you'd love. $ENTITY You've been wanting one of these, $ENTITY right, ... Here. $ENTITY It's yours!
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Oh,... ! $ENTITY You got me $ENTITY That's so nice of you! I don't have anything to give you in return but a big smile, $ENTITY and maybe a hug.... Thank you,... !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's nothing important. $ENTITY I just found something that I thought you might be interested in. $ENTITY Isn't this yours,... ? $ENTITY It was just lying in the street, $ENTITY so I saved it for you.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY I can't believe it! $ENTITY You found my precious ... I've looked all over $ENTITY for this. $ENTITY I was starting to think I'd never see it again. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY this sounds absolutely ridiculous to say out loud, $ENTITY but I had to tell you about a dream I had. $ENTITY You were accused of stealing ... and sentenced to 20 years in space jail! $ENTITY I'm not sure whether space jail is a real thing or not, $ENTITY but I wanted to see you just in case.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY One time I accidentally walked out of a store without paying for a piece of candy. $ENTITY Do you think that's what this dream was about? $ENTITY Will you hide me in your basement? $ENTITY , $ENTITY just kidding! $ENTITY I went back and paid for the candy later, $ENTITY so I think I'm safe for now.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY You've been having a hard time sleeping lately, $ENTITY right?... Well, $ENTITY I found a tip that might help. $ENTITY Try putting a sprig of lavender in your pillowcase. $ENTITY I read it in $ENTITY Weekly.
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Lavender is one of my favorite fragrances, $ENTITY but won't I just stay up all night sniffing my pillow? $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY That magazine has never led me astray in the past. $ENTITY I'll give it a try. $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I've got a lot to do at home, $ENTITY so I should probably get going. $ENTITY But thank you for tracking me down today,... I'm glad this all worked out. $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY I suppose it's time for me to head home. $ENTITY Thanks again for finding me, $ENTITY .
OT Q04 3P_Fu $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY if that's everything, $ENTITY I should probably head home and let $ENTITY get back to her day. $ENTITY Good to see you,... !
