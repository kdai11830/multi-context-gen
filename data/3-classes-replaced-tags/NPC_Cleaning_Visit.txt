NPC Cleaning Visit So, yes, Ms. $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , right? She tells me, "The town's being swarmed with weeds! Please help me!" $ENTITY But there are just so many, I think I must have fainted from the shock... .
NPC Cleaning Visit $ENTITY Take a look. Weeds all over! As far as the eye can see ... ...What in the world? $ENTITY Hey... The weeds are all gone... Oh, I get it!... It must have been the mystical guardian of weeding! $ENTITY We're saved, $ENTITY ! Rejoice!

NPC Cleaning Visit $ENTITY Oh my! I'm so happy! $ENTITY , please, allow me to share the happy with you right away!
