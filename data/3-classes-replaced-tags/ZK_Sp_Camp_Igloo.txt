ZK Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Where should I build my house? $ENTITY Near Main Street to enjoy the urban life... ? Hmm...I'd assume that living next to the ocean might be a bit too cold these months, so that's out... 
ZK Sp Camp_Igloo ... I think I'll move next to your house for warmth... Nah! $ENTITY I'm just foolin' with you! $ENTITY Hah ha!
