ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko So $ENTITY uses a double bed? Huh... He probably needs lots of sleep not to wake up grouchy. $ENTITY I guess he's not getting enough sleep,... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY lives on his own, right,... ? $ENTITY I wonder why there's a two-seat couch here then... $ENTITY Maybe... he likes to stretch out while watching his stories? That's what I like to do anyway.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Listen up, ... Look at someone's chair, and you'll find out what that person's interested in. $ENTITY Let's consider $ENTITY 's chair...

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 's favorite piece of clothing? $ENTITY I bet it totally is! But that's strange. I expected his favorite garment to be $ENTITY his mummy sarcophagus! $ENTITY Hah ha!... It's...because he's so old. Get it? $ENTITY OK, humor this good is utterly wasted on today's youth.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY I didn't expect to see that here... I wonder what he does with the ... Maybe $ENTITY practices scowling in front of the mirror twice a day to stay scary?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko Earlier $ENTITY I found a book called $ENTITY on the $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY You think he reads in a really angry voice when he's all by himself?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Ah,... for us,... ! $ENTITY I guess that's how a grown-up man behaves!

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Oh,... Looks nice! $ENTITY And I assumed $ENTITY was too much of a curmudgeon to ever truly appreciate the beauty of flowers.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Whoa,... has ... I suppose for a grumpy dude like ... finding ways to stay inside are key, $ENTITY !
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY seems to have ... Well, as long as he doesn't think it measures his age, I suppose I have no problem with it!

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY What's $ENTITY doing with $ENTITY It just feels so out of the ordinary for him to have a softer side... Uh, $ENTITY I should probably stop thinking. $ENTITY You know, he must have a special reason for keeping it... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY it doesn't seem like $ENTITY to have ... does it? I wonder if he curls up in it when no one's looking... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Hm.... Doesn't really seem like something $ENTITY would be into! $ENTITY Then again, $ENTITY it all makes TOTAL sense when you think about it... . $ENTITY I don't know how, but it has to!

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY there seems to be a nice $ENTITY here... Mm, we'd better leave it alone. $ENTITY It'd be too easy to start splashing around and getting this place wet.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's kind of unusual to see $ENTITY as a room decoration... Maybe $ENTITY is very particular about how he likes his room set up?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY with such a scary face... I'd never expect to see $ENTITY ! $ENTITY He looks gruff, $ENTITY but I guess he likes fruity furniture sometimes, huh?... Don't laugh, don't laugh... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY ? ... I wonder if he can actually play it. $ENTITY Perhaps he tried learning in college and never figured out how to get past the F chord... ?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Hmm. This room smells like ... . $ENTITY Sort of like old beans and maple syrup.

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Huh... For some reason it kinda smells like ... Or maybe it's just my imagination?
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Welcome to $ENTITY 's house! $ENTITY Please make yourself at home! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it's a bit weird for ME to say that of course, but... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ko $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY actually chose all the furniture in his room by himself... $ENTITY I mean, I suppose it'd be weird if he let someone else do it.
