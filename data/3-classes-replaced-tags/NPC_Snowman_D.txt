NPC Snowman D Mmmm... What a calm feeling! $ENTITY The ideal sense of balance I've been yearning for... That's what's going on with this body right now! This is true snow perfection! $ENTITY Are you perhaps a well-known sculptor? $ENTITY I am indebted to you for creating me with such exquisite balance. $ENTITY I would like to repay you for your good work, but all I have is this bingo game... Oh! Of course! How about a game of bingo?
NPC Snowman D Splendid! This heavyset body! This tightly packed head! $ENTITY And the solid stability created from uniting the two! $ENTITY I'm so pleased! $ENTITY Ho ho ho! Observe! I'm perfect from every angle! $ENTITY As a token of appreciation for you making me so wonderful, let's play a game of bingo!
NPC Snowman D Bravo! $ENTITY Wonderful! $ENTITY Such amazing craftsmanship... Who in the world are you? $ENTITY You're a snowman builder of the rarest caliber, that's who you are! $ENTITY I am overflowing with joy to have been scooped into a body like this! $ENTITY I'd like to express my profound appreciation with a game of bingo! What do you say?
NPC Snowman D This cold air... How refreshing it is! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Snowman $ENTITY . I'm a gentleman who dedicates his life to putting ladies first! $ENTITY Incidentally... though I know I should be grateful just to have been given life in this town... more than a small part of me wishes there was a bit more balance to my form. Good gracious! Pardon me for being so direct! I guess it's just part of snow nature!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY So close! $ENTITY I was so close to being built as a well-balanced masterpiece! $ENTITY But it seems the imperfections have added up to make me a little... off.
NPC Snowman D ... I thought about holding back my comments, but for the sake of your future self, I'll say this out loud: $ENTITY UTTER $ENTITY NONSENSE! $ENTITY You cannot just smoosh a ball of snow together any which way! $ENTITY To prevent more snow victims from falling prey to your snow-forming madness, etch this into your brain: $ENTITY the head is slightly smaller than the body! $ENTITY That's how it works... I'm counting on you to get it right next time!
NPC Snowman D Wow! This is quite the supermodel figure! In some worlds, perhaps... I see you've given me a small head, no doubt to keep me in fashion with the times! However, in the world of snowmen, having a head that is too small is never the least bit in vogue... Why, you ask?! Because it looks ridiculous!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY What?! You say you are without a $ENTITY bingo card $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Then I, $ENTITY Snowman $ENTITY , shall bestow $ENTITY upon you a bingo card! $ENTITY Thanks! Bingo? No, thanks!
NPC Snowman D Bee, bing, bingo! You've come for a $ENTITY bingo card $ENTITY , am I right? $ENTITY Yes, please! Bingo? No, thanks!
NPC Snowman D I... Are you certain... But bingo is quite enthralling... .
NPC Snowman D Ah. It would appear that you have too many things to carry the bingo card. Please come by once you've made some room in your pockets. $ENTITY But please come back today!
NPC Snowman D Well then, here is the bingo card. $ENTITY I can only give you one, so please do not lose it!
NPC Snowman D Oh! So you'd like to listen to the rules! $ENTITY Then I will give you both a card and an explanation! $ENTITY I can only give you one card, so please do not lose it!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY On the bottom screen is the bingo card. The game is played using this card. $ENTITY I will give you the number of the day. $ENTITY If you have that number on your card, touch its square to punch a hole in the card! $ENTITY If you have a line of holes running vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, you've got a bingo! You can then trade it in for a prize! $ENTITY Numbers will be chosen once a day using the slots. My eyes will tell you the number! Today's number has not yet been decided. Please use the slots to get today's number. And check my eyes!

Check my eyes! $ENTITY If you'd like to try the slots, you'll have to come back first thing in the morning.
NPC Snowman D My apologies! That explanation dragged on a bit. $ENTITY Well then, shall we get the bingo game started, my friend? $ENTITY To kick things off, touch the center of the card to punch a hole in it.

NPC Snowman D Excellent!
NPC Snowman D My number for the day has not been set! $ENTITY Please get my eyeballs spinning! $ENTITY Here goes! No, thanks.
NPC Snowman D Are you enjoying the bingo game? $ENTITY Your fate rests in a snowman's eyes! Give them a spin! $ENTITY Here goes! No, thanks.
NPC Snowman D My, my! Are you in $ENTITY to do some sightseeing? $ENTITY May I interest you in a round of bingo? It'll be a nice trip memory! You can spin the slots right now! $ENTITY OK! No, thanks.
NPC Snowman D Welcome to $ENTITY ! It appears you have a bingo card. $ENTITY Now if you'll get my snowman eyes spinning, we'll discover your fate or at least today's number. $ENTITY Here goes! No, thanks.
NPC Snowman D My number for the day is... ! Would you like to play bingo? $ENTITY Yes! I'm not playing.
NPC Snowman D Are you enjoying your bingo game? $ENTITY If you'd like to work on your bingo card, my number for the day is $ENTITY . Want to check your card? $ENTITY Yes! No, thanks.
NPC Snowman D Welcome to ... Oh! Is that a bingo card you have there? $ENTITY If you're playing bingo, my number for the day is ... Just thought you'd want to know! $ENTITY Thanks! I'm not playing.
NPC Snowman D I'm so glad you stopped to chat! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY 's very own $ENTITY Snowman... You know, bingo is a great game to play even when you're away from your hometown! $ENTITY My number for the day is ... Take a moment to see if it's on your bingo card! $ENTITY Will do! No, thanks!
NPC Snowman D I see... .
NPC Snowman D Oh... Well, do let me know if you change your mind.
NPC Snowman D Hmm... I wonder if anyone else is searching for ... .
NPC Snowman D I see... Well, if you know of anyone in search of a good, high-quality $ENTITY , please send them my way.
NPC Snowman D Well, well! How can I help you? $ENTITY I want to play bingo! Never mind.
NPC Snowman D What's this?! It appears you are without a bingo card! This cannot stand! $ENTITY Bingo cards are symbols of thankfulness... We $ENTITY Snowmen $ENTITY have a way. We give out bingo cards to show our gratitude for being skillfully made.
NPC Snowman D Spring is such a joyful season! It is simply splendid! $ENTITY This might sound strange, but it's my favorite season after winter.
NPC Snowman D Bingo cards expire in the spring. $ENTITY After that, you'll have to wait until next year and start anew!
NPC Snowman D We are much obliged this winter. $ENTITY I'd like to thank you on behalf of my entire family. We'll have to do our best to meet up and rekindle our friendship next year!
NPC Snowman D Have you already met my family? $ENTITY It may seem as though we lack a... cohesive theme. But that's not the case when we're in our other form.
NPC Snowman D I may not look it now, but I was quite the slim gentleman in my younger years. But once I became a family man, I began gaining weight. And now I have quite an impressive waistline.
NPC Snowman D Standing all day is not as much of a chore as you might imagine. $ENTITY Try it! Why don't you stand next to me and just let your mind idle for a little while?
NPC Snowman D I shall enjoy this wonderful town for some time!
NPC Snowman D The balance between my head and body may be questionable, but my mustache is beyond reproach! $ENTITY I'm quite particular about it.
NPC Snowman D They say men hit their prime... Well, they hit their prime when they're ready to hit their prime! $ENTITY But we snowmen look most attractive when we're just starting to melt!
NPC Snowman D I will soon be melting away, but this doesn't mean farewell for good! $ENTITY I will return to this town again as new snow. And, with your help, I'll be reborn as another $ENTITY Snowman $ENTITY !
NPC Snowman D I wish I could have said something while I was being made... A simple "too big" or "too small" might have made all the difference. $ENTITY But, alas! I just couldn't make myself speak until my head was on my body.
NPC Snowman D What do you think is the mark of a truly mature adult? $ENTITY If you ask me, I would say it's perseverance. Perseverance through the cold. $ENTITY Perseverance in standing around. $ENTITY Perseverance through unbalance... .
NPC Snowman D Only a well-made $ENTITY Snowman $ENTITY can give away bingo cards. $ENTITY In my next life, I wish to be better crafted so I can be a real gentleman and hand out cards to everyone!
NPC Snowman D You must be wondering what will happen to this hat after I'm gone. $ENTITY Unfortunately, it melts away with the rest of me!
NPC Snowman D It is hot... But I will not bow to temperature! I will not break with tradition! The hat stays on! A hat like this is the mark of a true gentleman.
NPC Snowman D Spring has arrived! The season of the snowfamily has come to an end.
NPC Snowman D Spring is hot, isn't it? My mustache zone is getting quite stuffy!
NPC Snowman D I will remain in this town only as a lingering winter scent. $ENTITY Oh? Not necessary, you say? $ENTITY Well, regardless of my intentions, I will eventually just melt away... .
NPC Snowman D We have been blessed this winter. $ENTITY On behalf of my family, I would like to express our appreciation. We will look forward to seeing you next year.
NPC Snowman D Wonderful... Spring, though it is so much different than winter, is also a splendid season.
NPC Snowman D Well, let us see here. $ENTITY Is this number on your card?
NPC Snowman D Well then... Snowman slots,... start $ENTITY spinning! ... 
NPC Snowman D And the number of the day is... 
NPC Snowman D ... 
NPC Snowman D Aha! It appears you do have ... Please punch a hole in your card!
NPC Snowman D ... I apologize that I could not be of any help to you.
NPC Snowman D Hmm... Nothing. $ENTITY I'm sorry that I've disappointed you.
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY DING! $ENTITY Splendid! You're one number away from a bingo!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY DOUBLE DING! $ENTITY So close! You're one number away in two different ways!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY TRIPLE DING! $ENTITY This is incredible! You're one away from bingo in three different ways! $ENTITY This is even rarer than an actual bingo!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY So close! I sincerely hope you get a bingo with your next number. If I could, I would cross my fingers!
NPC Snowman D Well, please do stop by tomorrow... if I haven't melted away yet.
NPC Snowman D Do come again! I shall be waiting right here, weather permitting!
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY Th- $ENTITY this is... 
NPC Snowman D ... 
NPC Snowman D Ho ho! This calls for a celebration! $ENTITY You've done it! $ENTITY It may have been a long journey, $ENTITY but that is precisely why you can enjoy a feeling of accomplishment. $ENTITY Now then, let me give you a prize in exchange for that bingo card.
NPC Snowman D $ENTITY This time, the prize is ... I've placed it with your belongings. Well, do come and play again after you've obtained another bingo card! And congratulations!
NPC Snowman D A bingo may seem far off in the distance, but patience is a virtue in this game! The way to bingo must be traversed steadily, one step at a time.
NPC Snowman D Splendid! $ENTITY Today's number opens the way for tomorrow. $ENTITY It is an important step forward in your journey toward bingo!
NPC Snowman D A word of advice for a bingo seeker such as yourself: if you have a bingo card, you can play bingo anywhere! $ENTITY You may be able to get a bingo more quickly by traveling to other towns with other $ENTITY Snowmen $ENTITY . Go speak with them, and get numbers from them!
NPC Snowman D Congratulations! This is a crucial step in your bingo journey! $ENTITY Bingos do not happen overnight. $ENTITY They happen through perseverance!
NPC Snowman D Welcome! Normally I would invite you to participate in a rousing game of bingo... But you need a bingo card for that! $ENTITY You can obtain a bingo card by creating a large, well-balanced snowman like myself!
NPC Snowman D Bingo cards are a token of a snowman's appreciation... Snowmen $ENTITY give cards to those who have skillfully given them life. $ENTITY You must endeavor to make a fine $ENTITY Snowman $ENTITY in your town and get yourself a bingo card!
NPC Snowman D Your bingo card is only valid through the winter. $ENTITY I truly hope you are able to achieve a bingo before the card expires!
