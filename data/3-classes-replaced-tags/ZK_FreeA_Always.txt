ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY My musical roots are founded firmly in both $ENTITY and... . Oh, but I've been influenced by a few books as well. It's all part of the whole $ENTITY package... . $ENTITY I often read my favorite book right before a music concert starts. I must've read it $ENTITY times at least. $ENTITY What's it titled? You don't say.
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Despite my laid-back looks, $ENTITY I used to be in a band when I was a kid! $ENTITY We already disbanded though... Oh? $ENTITY The reason we disbanded?... Well... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY The music I've been following?... Basically, $ENTITY I like up-tempo songs you can dance to,... . $ENTITY A lot of anime has really up-tempo theme songs, now that I think of it. That's probably why I love them! $ENTITY I've really been inspired a lot by those songs... I want to see more anime themes appear in dance clubs.... You can't deny that'd be awesome!
ZK FreeA Always When you listen to pop music, $ENTITY you often hear them saying "shorty" in the lyrics over and over... , $ENTITY what do you think it actually refers to? $ENTITY A short person. Your significant other. Some kid.
ZK FreeA Always Hey, $ENTITY , did you know? $ENTITY That train that runs through town is in its fourth iteration. $ENTITY Up to the third iteration, $ENTITY everything was based on the first iteration's designs with only minor changes! $ENTITY But the fourth iteration is radically different!... It inherited the DNA from the first iteration, but... it's the first one that's had a major change in design,... The current one has awesome new variants, such as limited and rapid trains... I think the red color of the LE012-series limited train is simply the best of all! $ENTITY Gah! $ENTITY I've completely rambled about trains, haven't I?! $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY My train obsession is a secret!
ZK FreeA Always ... do you by any chance know the definition of "SF" in SF movies or SF comics? $ENTITY Science fiction. Space fantasy. I have no idea.
ZK FreeA Always ... do you collect anything as a hobby, like stamps or toys or baseball cards or video games? $ENTITY ( Yes, I do! Nope.
ZK FreeA Always ... I have something vital I must tell you! $ENTITY I'm an enthusiast,... but I'm absolutely not a geek! $ENTITY Please don't confuse the two... 
ZK FreeA Always ... My relationship with that famous actress?... Ah, $ENTITY we're just good friends who go way back! ... What, really? A press conference?... Please contact my office for those kinds of things. $ENTITY All right, I know $ENTITY has nothing like that,... But now $ENTITY I feel kinda dumb... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY is the title,... You should totally read it sometime! $ENTITY It's definitely worth your time! $ENTITY All of my natural swagger... It was probably influenced by this book.
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Hopefully you'll get to find a great book like that,... !
ZK FreeA Always The other members and I, $ENTITY we had very different taste in music... That can make it very difficult to keep a band unified, you know?
ZK FreeA Always Things were going great until we sold out and went mainstream. $ENTITY Then it just wasn't about the music anymore. It was about the image... 
ZK FreeA Always We just realized $ENTITY we'd reached our peak! $ENTITY We had nowhere further up to go, so we got bored... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY That's what I assumed they were talking about too, ... But all these songs about short people... Doesn't that seem a bit excessive to you?
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY That's what I figured. They seem to just call people whatever they want, like "boo" or "baby" or "shawty"... Sometimes, it can be hard to follow when you just want a love song... At the very least it seems to refer to someone they really care about, so I suppose I'm down with that. $ENTITY Do you get it now, $ENTITY shorty?
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY That's totally one of the meanings for the word! $ENTITY But I think it's rar $ENTITY for you to hear a pop song talking about "some kid," you know? $ENTITY ! $ENTITY That's sort of a shame, though.... I'd totally listen to a pop song about a really cool kid!
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Various genres have appeared over time, $ENTITY so pegging down a definition has gotten a little difficult... But "science fiction" was the original meaning! $ENTITY That means it refers to science-fantasy novels as well! Me,... I don't care as long as there's a love story in there at some point... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah,... When you watch films that simply ignore scientific rules... I guess it's pretty simple to just call those fantasy movies, right? $ENTITY I'm OK with anything,... as long as there's some romance in the story... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah... There're just so many things it could be, making it difficult to tell them apart, huh? $ENTITY There are just too many words that start with S and F and could fit into the meaning. $ENTITY It's so confusing... For example... Super $ENTITY Famicom!
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY I knew it!... It's no wonder I felt this special bond between us! $ENTITY To be honest... I'm a collector who likes to collect soda bottle caps. $ENTITY There are just so many varieties of sodas out there, $ENTITY and I'm obsessed with the caps and the fizz... I feel like my collection will never be fully completed,... but I'll keep working on it slowly,... . $ENTITY You should also get into bottle cap collecting!... Mmm, the sound of a fresh cap is magic. "Ch-kahhhh!"
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY I guess you're better off when you don't have a ridiculous obsession like I do. $ENTITY Mmm... Bottle caps... .
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Your eyes... are very striking! They're hard to ignore! $ENTITY 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I bet you have a hard time concentrating when you look in the mirror,... !
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY I was totally absorbed there for a moment... 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Weird... I feel like someone's been watching me all morning,... You caught me. Just your imagination!
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY I see... So YOU'RE the one $ENTITY who's been staring at me, huh? $ENTITY Well, don't be shy. I know I'm pretty fabulous,... !
ZK FreeA Always Really? $ENTITY Wow, I have a super-vivid imagination then... 
ZK FreeA Always Hey, ... Are you good at making snowmen?... I'm what some may call a "snowman savant." $ENTITY If you roll the snowball too fast, $ENTITY it'll easily break, $ENTITY so make sure you roll it nice and gentle. $ENTITY It's just like a good massage, you know... ? $ENTITY Too hard or too fast and you'll break the person in half! $ENTITY Once you've got two nice, round snowballs, roll them together to finish up your snowman! $ENTITY Sounds pretty simple, $ENTITY but it can be pretty difficult to keep a proper balance between the snowballs... . $ENTITY The trick is to have the body a bit bigger than the head,... !
ZK FreeA Always Hey, ... Did you know that snowmen can talk? $ENTITY It sounds like a lie, $ENTITY but it's a true story! I swear!... Not only that, $ENTITY I've heard they have different personalities, $ENTITY depending on their size. $ENTITY The one I'm most interested in $ENTITY is a big-sized snowman! $ENTITY I heard he's quite a gentleman... Heh heh... Although... no one is quite as amazing a gentleman as I am!
ZK FreeA Always ... do you collect anything as a hobby? $ENTITY You know, stamps or toys or things like that?... ( Yes, I do! Nope.
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY I knew it!... No wonder we have the same hungry look in our eyes! $ENTITY To be honest... I collect plastic bottle caps. All kinds! $ENTITY There are many different kinds of plastic bottle caps. $ENTITY I just love them! $ENTITY It's one of those things I'll probably never get tired of, $ENTITY so I'll take my time and enjoy collecting! $ENTITY Make sure... you don't go too crazy collecting things, OK?
ZK FreeA Always Hey, $ENTITY , did you know? $ENTITY That train you see traveling from town to town is fourth generation.... Till the third generation, $ENTITY everything was based on the first generation's designs with only minor changes. $ENTITY But the fourth generation is different!... It inherited the DNA from the first generation, but... It's the first one that's had a major change in design,... The current one has various styles, such as limited and rapid designs... I think the rapid LS012-series with that white line on the cobalt blue $ENTITY looks sharp! It's my favorite! $ENTITY Are you lost yet? Should I start from the beginning?... I sort of geek out on trains. $ENTITY It's my secret thing.
ZK FreeA Always ... What? $ENTITY Are you asking if I'm trying to be a real $ENTITY pro?... No comment! ... A press conference?... Oh, please contact my office for those kinds of things. $ENTITY Oh!... Sorry, ... You caught me in the middle of something.... I know there's absolutely nothing like that in ... I was just pretending for a laugh! $ENTITY Hah ha!... Now I feel kind of dumb... .
ZK FreeA Always .... What happened? Whatchoo lookin' at?
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY 
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY #x0;
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY I was thinking about something... I was thinking $ENTITY it would be great if we could stay friends forever!
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Errr, $ENTITY nothing... I was just thinking about how I'd love to have eyes like yours... My eyes are sooooo last week.
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I'm sorry... You can really hypnotize people with those eyes! $ENTITY If you keep looking at me, I... . $ENTITY Huh? What were we talking about?
ZK FreeA Always $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY I'm sorry... Your eyes are really good at distracting people. $ENTITY Your nose too... .
