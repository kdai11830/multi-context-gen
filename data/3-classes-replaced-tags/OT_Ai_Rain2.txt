OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY hello again... Do you think this rain will ever stop today,... ?
OT Ai Rain2
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Oh! An umbrella, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I can't imagine WHY you'd use one on a lovely day like today. $ENTITY Now, on a hot, summery day? THAT I could understand, $ENTITY .
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Hey! No umbrella in all this rain?!... Sorry. You just surprised me, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I usually see everyone trying to stay dry. $ENTITY But I'm with you. Let's soak it up, $ENTITY .
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY I wonder if it keeps on raining because the sky is crying. $ENTITY If that's the case... $ENTITY Stop your blubbering up there! $ENTITY I'm getting soaked to the bone, $ENTITY !
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY You'd think I wouldn't want any part of all this mud, right?... I'm usually fussy, $ENTITY I know. But I'd totally roll around in it. $ENTITY Well,... if it didn't mean I'd track mud all over my clean floor, $ENTITY .
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY You know, I'd like rain a LOT more if it wasn't so wet, $ENTITY .
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Every raindrop is like a musical note in a pretty symphony! $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Is it just ME who feels that way?
OT Ai Rain2 I'm getting so soaked out here, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Oh, what I wouldn't GIVE to be a frog sometimes.
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Can't it always be like this? $ENTITY Rainy? Wet? Muddy? $ENTITY It's like the whole world is my pond, $ENTITY !
OT Ai Rain2 A little rain can be nice, $ENTITY I guess, $ENTITY but THIS much? $ENTITY I am so ready for tomorrow to start, $ENTITY .
OT Ai Rain2 $ENTITY Oh, it's SO lovely. My skin is just getting slimier and slimier in all this rain, $ENTITY !
