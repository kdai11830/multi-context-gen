KO 3P An $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , can I ask you a question? $ENTITY Why is it that when you say hello to me, you always make such a scary face? $ENTITY When I see you with other people, you look like you're all relaxed and smiling!... What gives?!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Like I said... it's nothing! $ENTITY You're just making a mountain out of a molehill! $ENTITY #x0;*
KO 3P An $ENTITY Geesh... I really don't know what's cool or popular these days.... I just can't keep up anymore! $ENTITY ?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Aw, man! $ENTITY You noticed, huh... ? I'm sorry! There really isn't a big reason for it. $ENTITY When I see someone who looks as fierce as you... it just gets me all fired up!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Ah, I see. $ENTITY You've got that problem too... Reminds me of my old self. $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY Let's do some special practice!... Try looking at my face and greeting me with a smile!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY Why do we gotta do that all of a sudden?! $ENTITY Doing this funky exercise... It's punishment, not practice! Gah! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An $ENTITY It'll be fine! $ENTITY Just be quiet and give it a try already!... Like this! $ENTITY Smile and say hello... Hello! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An ... Hello! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Is that really how you thought my face looked? $ENTITY I'm gonna show you again, so watch real careful-like this time!... All right! $ENTITY Smile and say hello... Hello! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An ... Hello! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An $ENTITY No, no! $ENTITY Now you look even more intense than you did before! $ENTITY Hey, ... Come on and show her how it's done! $ENTITY Show us a big, sincere smile like I did! $ENTITY Like this? (Smile!) Like this? (Smirk!) Like this? (Evil grin!)
KO 3P An $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Nice job! $ENTITY That's a great smile! $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , got it now?... That's the face you need to make!
KO 3P An $ENTITY , your smile... is powerful enough to shock a crying kid into submission! $ENTITY It's totally different from what $ENTITY did... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY Was that supposed to be some sort of compliment?
KO 3P An $ENTITY I suppose it can't be helped... All right! $ENTITY I got it! $ENTITY , $ENTITY you're just gonna have to keep practicing until you finally get it right!
KO 3P An $ENTITY What? $ENTITY Can't we just drop this silly thing already?... 
KO 3P An ... Not like that! $ENTITY That's worse than the face $ENTITY just made!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Hmmmm... So it's supposed to be like this?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY You did it!... WAIT! $ENTITY That's not right at all!
KO 3P An ... Not like that! $ENTITY That's the exact same face $ENTITY just made!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Hmmmm... I see. $ENTITY Like this?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Not you too, ... No, don't copy that! $ENTITY Are you two trying to make fun of me or something?!
KO 3P An $ENTITY You can't fool me! $ENTITY I saw it with my own two eyes! $ENTITY , you fell pretty hard into a hole! $ENTITY And you didn't move for a while afterward! $ENTITY Are you sure you're not badly hurt?!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Grr... $ENTITY You meanie! $ENTITY That was... on purpose! $ENTITY It was totally on purpose! $ENTITY It was such a nice-looking hole! I wanted to see what it'd be like to fall into it!
KO 3P An ... Well, if you say so... I guess I won't press the issue any further! $ENTITY You're getting older now, so you should keep that false pride of yours in check, all right?... It'll be too late if you hurt yourself!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Hmph! $ENTITY Mind your own business! $ENTITY What's a man without his pride?! $ENTITY I'd sooner get hurt than make a ridiculous promise like that!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Geesh, $ENTITY I'm just trying to look out for you... Fine! Do what you want!... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY You can't fool me! $ENTITY I saw it with my own eyes!... just a bit ago you were screaming like a little girl about a scorpion or something, right?... Did you get stung?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Grrr... $ENTITY You meanie!... Like I would ever scream like a little girl! $ENTITY That was just... my way of communicating with scorpions! $ENTITY He's more of the aggressive type, so I was trying to train him a bit! $ENTITY That's all!
KO 3P An $ENTITY You can't fool me! $ENTITY I saw it with my own two eyes! $ENTITY , just a bit ago, you hit your head on the store entrance! $ENTITY You really surprised the shopkeeper!... Are you all right? Did you bust your noggin or something?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Grrr... $ENTITY You meanie! $ENTITY I didn't hit my head like that! $ENTITY The door and I... were just battling! $ENTITY They used to call me Head-Buttin' $ENTITY back in the day! Everyone was scared of me! $ENTITY I wanted to keep my skills up, and since there was a good-looking wall, $ENTITY I thought I'd test my strength!
KO 3P An $ENTITY You can't fool me! $ENTITY I saw it with my own two eyes! $ENTITY , you were lying on the ground because you hit your foot on a rock! You all right?
KO 3P An $ENTITY Gah! $ENTITY You meanie! $ENTITY I didn't bump into it! $ENTITY I was just... testing its density! $ENTITY The rocks in our town have a lot of guts!... They're rock hard!
KO 3P An $ENTITY HA HA HA! $ENTITY You still saying that?... It's called half-body bathing! $ENTITY People do it to heat up by standing in lukewarm water up to their hips for a while, right? $ENTITY I hear it's actually really good for your body... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY What kind of crazy thing is that?! $ENTITY Those goofy youngsters don't know NOTHIN' these days! $ENTITY A real bath... is where the water is so hot, it makes your skin tingle!... And you get dunked to your head! $ENTITY I don't know if that half-body thing is good for you or not, but I can tell you they're forgetting somethin'!
KO 3P An $ENTITY I hear what you're saying, but... Half-body bathing isn't all that bad. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY it's kind of like making your own sauna or something! $ENTITY , you like taking a swig of an ice-cold soda after sitting in a sauna for a while, right?
KO 3P An $ENTITY A mug of soda after some time in a sauna?... Yeah, it's good. $ENTITY In fact... it's downright great! $ENTITY So what you're saying is, $ENTITY half-body bathing is like a sauna... OK, that's not so bad sounding!... Maybe I'll even try it sometime!
KO 3P An $ENTITY I'm glad you understand now!... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY HA HA HA! $ENTITY You mean leggings?... I suppose they're sort of like really stylish long johns!
KO 3P An $ENTITY That's ridiculous! $ENTITY To me they look like the exact same flabbin' thing! $ENTITY I accidentally asked the clerk about her long johns, and she just started to laugh at me... I won't stand for it!
KO 3P An $ENTITY I can understand how you feel. ... Up until recently, people were calling them tights too. $ENTITY I bet pretty soon $ENTITY we'll probably start calling them something completely different again... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY Ugh, you gotta be kidding me... 
KO 3P An $ENTITY HA HA HA! $ENTITY Are you still bugged about that?... They only said you're cute! $ENTITY These days, $ENTITY girls are using "cute" for just about everything! It works for both girls AND boys! $ENTITY I'm sure they didn't mean it in the same way you're taking it right now, $ENTITY 
KO 3P An $ENTITY But why do you think they'd look at me and say I'm cute?! $ENTITY Man, $ENTITY you can't just use words like that... They should spend some time building their vocabularies!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Well, there are completely different kinds of cute. $ENTITY For example, ugly cute and scary cute... Hey, ... what kind of cute do you think is best for describing ... Ugly cute. Scary cute. ...
KO 3P An ... I'm supposedly ugly but still cute because of it?... That makes no sense whatsoever! $ENTITY Geesh! $ENTITY Why do youngsters these days have to make everything so crazy complicated?!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Calm down now. $ENTITY It's a good thing! $ENTITY I'm sure "ugly" was meant in a good way!... It's not supposed to be insulting, $ENTITY so don't overthink it!... !
KO 3P An ... So I'm supposedly scary but cute? $ENTITY Is there some sorta scary scale? $ENTITY Geesh! $ENTITY Why do youngsters these days need to make everything so flabbin' complicated!
KO 3P An $ENTITY Calm down now. $ENTITY It's a good thing! $ENTITY I'm sure "scary" was meant in a good way!... It's not supposed to be insulting, so don't overthink it!... !
KO 3P An ... Why aren't you saying anything?! $ENTITY You can't mean...... You think they meant cute as in CUTE? $ENTITY Then that means they were trying to pick a fight with me! $ENTITY 
KO 3P An $ENTITY Calm down! $ENTITY I'm sure they just used it out of habit! $ENTITY Besides, $ENTITY the way you react to every little thing is actually kind of cute!... True story! $ENTITY !
