BO Q06 A_Report Oh, $ENTITY so $ENTITY hasn't tried it on yet.... Maybe $ENTITY #x0; was so happy that $ENTITY #x0; got shy, $ENTITY .
BO Q06 A_Report I guess $ENTITY didn't like it. $ENTITY Man, I really thought $ENTITY #x0;'d be into it.
BO Q06 A_Report I guess $ENTITY didn't like it.... A huh huh huh! $ENTITY I'm just the worst at picking out presents. $ENTITY 
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY thought it was just fine, huh?... But $ENTITY isn't that just another way of saying "just right"?

BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Thanks for making that delivery to ... You're a lifesaver,... !
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY If I'd held on to that any longer, I think $ENTITY probably would have exploded with rage. $ENTITY Like this. $ENTITY "Aaaaarrrrgghhhhh ... KABLAM!" $ENTITY That would've been scary. $ENTITY Yeah, it's a good thing you returned it.
BO Q06 A_Report I was holding on to that thing for a pretty long time. $ENTITY Did $ENTITY say anything about that? $ENTITY Actually... Don't remember.
BO Q06 A_Report Ugh, $ENTITY you're even spacier than I am,... You've probably got stuff at home that you're forgetting to give back yourself!
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I'm so relieved she's not mad! $ENTITY She doesn't get mad very often, $ENTITY but when she does, $ENTITY watch out!
BO Q06 A_Report Oh, really? $ENTITY Whew,... I mean, if she called me out on that, everyone in town would know. $ENTITY And then no one would EVER lend anything to me!
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY She liked the wrapping job?... Maybe I've finally figured out how to wrap presents!
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY great!... When she gets mad, $ENTITY it's like an earthquake!
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY I'm glad he wasn't mad!... Of course, he's so chill, he probably never, ever gets mad.
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Oh, great, $ENTITY so he wasn't mad?... It's hard to tell sometimes, 'cause his regular speaking voice is so loud.
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY That's great! $ENTITY I thought he would have yelled something like,... "You're late!"
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Scatterbrained?! $ENTITY Next time I see him, $ENTITY I'm gonna try to remember to give him a piece of my mind!
BO Q06 A_Report $ENTITY Thanks for making that delivery! $ENTITY Did $ENTITY say anything about it? $ENTITY Actually... Don't remember.
