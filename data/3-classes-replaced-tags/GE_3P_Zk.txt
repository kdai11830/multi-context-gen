GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Just look at this mess! You spilled... all over me!! $ENTITY I am, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY NEVER gonna forgive you!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Please don't hate me! $ENTITY I never meant to make you cry. $ENTITY I was only trying to share my drink!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY What $ENTITY EVER! $ENTITY I didn't want to take a sip of your stupid drink. $ENTITY And now my outfit is totally RUINED!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY 
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Say you'll forgive me! I blame my own eyesight. I was struck blind by the sight of you, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY If that's the case, $ENTITY then your beauty is too dangerous!... Perhaps it's $ENTITY YOU who's to blame!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Me?! $ENTITY You can't blame me for being too beautiful. $ENTITY That's like yelling at the sun for being too $ENTITY sunny! $ENTITY But there $ENTITY WAS that one time the sun got in my eyes and I spilled a drink all over you. $ENTITY So I forgive you.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY I'm relieved. $ENTITY I couldn't imagine living in a world where you refused to speak to me!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY It isn't true, $ENTITY my dear! $ENTITY If you let me get a clean rag and some water, $ENTITY I can surely dab away the stains. $ENTITY I'd ask you not to be so mad at me, but the truth is, $ENTITY you look so lovely when your temper's up, $ENTITY 
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? $ENTITY You can't just $ENTITY SPLASH water on any fabric you want! $ENTITY My outfit will have to be dry- cleaned, and $ENTITY YOU'RE paying. $ENTITY And I totally DO look cute when I'm mad.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY I'm glad we're in agreement on that at least, $ENTITY !
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY You're just in time, $ENTITY ! We were talking about what I need to do $ENTITY to make myself marketable. $ENTITY You know, as an international pop star! $ENTITY Everyone in $ENTITY loves me, $ENTITY but the WORLD has to love me! $ENTITY New clothes! New makeup! You're already a star!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Excellent advice! $ENTITY A new wardrobe would really do wonders for your international appeal.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Seriously?! But I just bought a whole closet full of new clothes! $ENTITY You're joking, right? $ENTITY I thought so!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Excellent advice! From what I can glean from the popular magazines of the day, $ENTITY makeup is vital. $ENTITY However, it would be such a shame to cover up that youthful, glowing face of yours, $ENTITY my dear.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Maybe I can have a secret pop-star identity. $ENTITY When I wear makeup, $ENTITY I'll be known simply as $ENTITY ! $ENTITY But when I go all natural, $ENTITY I can be Ms.... . $ENTITY No one'll guess $ENTITY we're the same gal!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY There's no doubt in my mind that you're $ENTITY already the perfect pop star $ENTITY international OR local! We shall miss you terribly here in $ENTITY when you decide to pursue your career $ENTITY elsewhere.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY Do you believe that? ... Now I'll never leave ... My fans are too sweet!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY I now bring this meeting of the Super-Popular Kids' Club to order! $ENTITY First topic of discussion... $ENTITY What can we do to make ourselves even MORE popular in ... Any brilliant ideas, $ENTITY ?
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY For being a founding member of the club, $ENTITY I haven't given much thought to the idea of $ENTITY being popular. $ENTITY Perhaps we should focus on our $ENTITY INNER selves $ENTITY and not worry about what others think of us... $ENTITY Hear, hear! I object!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY I'm glad you agree with me! $ENTITY Instead of worrying about popularity, $ENTITY let's focus on our charitable donations.
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY You feel that way too, ... Maybe it's time we $ENTITY DID look deep within ourselves... or not. $ENTITY Whatever!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY You must be joking! Why should we bother convincing others that we're worthy of their adoration? $ENTITY The only person whose opinion truly matters $ENTITY is your own!
GE 3P Zk $ENTITY You're not gonna be long for this club with $ENTITY that attitude, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'm making you VP, $ENTITY !
