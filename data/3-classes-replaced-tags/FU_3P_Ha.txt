FU 3P Ha ... next time you come over we should talk about the sport of chess.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Chess!... Is that really a sport... ?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Sure it is! $ENTITY But if you'd like, $ENTITY we could talk about $ENTITY instead.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Sounds great! $ENTITY I can show you some of my moves. $ENTITY It's all about building muscle memory.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Sounds great! $ENTITY Maybe I'll show you my awesome techniques. $ENTITY We could do a little training!
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Sounds great! $ENTITY Maybe then you'll understand why I love it so much. $ENTITY I can show you why I train for hours every day!
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I'm not sure I'm ready for anything more than theory yet... 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I'm not sure I'm ready for anything more than stretching yet... 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY You train for hours every day? $ENTITY That's a lot of time I could spend reading... 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Really?! $ENTITY Then I'd be happy to just talk about it while I gulp down a vitamin-enriched $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY That sounds much better to me. $ENTITY And we could always watch sports on TV after that.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I've been writing riddles lately! $ENTITY Do you want to try solving some?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Sure! $ENTITY Riddles are like challenges, $ENTITY and I never back down from those.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY here we go: $ENTITY What can you catch $ENTITY but not throw?
FU 3P Ha ... A bad pass! $ENTITY Right?... Or did you mean "you" in general? $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY But... . That wasn't... The answer is "a cold," but I'll accept your version. $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Great!... Now it's my turn. $ENTITY What follows you 'round all day except noon, but never at night unless there's a full moon?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Hmm... A baby werewolf?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY You're not very good at this, are you, ladybro?... The answer is your shadow!
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Maybe we should both stick to knock-knock jokes.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Do you like flowers, $ENTITY ?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I don't exactly hate them. $ENTITY I don't think they like me much, $ENTITY though.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY The key to flowers is giving them lots of food, $ENTITY water, $ENTITY and love. $ENTITY Then they grow to be big and beautiful!
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Ohhhhh! $ENTITY Just like muscles! $ENTITY If you take care of your muscles, $ENTITY they grow to be big and beautiful too.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY You don't say... Well, I've recently started a botany journal to record daily observations of my flowers.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY that's a great idea! $ENTITY Maybe I'll start a muscle journal. $ENTITY To record daily observations of my buffness.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Do you like reading, $ENTITY ?
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I do like reading. $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY people comment all the time on how good I am at extreme speed reading.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I'm sure they have!... I read so much because I love daydreaming about other worlds. $ENTITY I can't stop reading sometimes.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY That's how I feel about exercise. $ENTITY It takes me to whole new worlds of pain. $ENTITY I can't stop feeling the burn!
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY I suppose we're not so different. $ENTITY You prefer to exercise your body, $ENTITY and I prefer to exercise my mind.
FU 3P Ha $ENTITY Cool! $ENTITY Who would have thought you and I $ENTITY are like two beefy peas in a pod, ladybro?
