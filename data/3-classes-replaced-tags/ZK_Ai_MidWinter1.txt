ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY good morning, $ENTITY . Know why I think today's $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is so incredibly cool? Because! $ENTITY Ugh, $ENTITY gross. $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY Because, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY because... $ENTITY I can't remember now!
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY I live for the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY . $ENTITY So dark, $ENTITY so mysterious. $ENTITY It's goth and noir, $ENTITY all rolled into one. Oh-oh! $ENTITY Now you've peered into my soul!... Don't tell anyone that I'm a creature of the night, OK?!
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY So, $ENTITY asking yourself where the sun went today, ... I think it was just... $ENTITY too... $ENTITY sleepy... $ENTITY to get... $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Wha? $ENTITY Mom, $ENTITY just gimme 10 more minutes!... Whoa!... I didn't really just call you "mom," $ENTITY did I?!
ZK Ai MidWinter1 So $ENTITY you probably know this already, $ENTITY but just in case you didn't, $ENTITY ...? $ENTITY The winter soulfish is here today! $ENTITY Dark as night! $ENTITY Stays for hours! $ENTITY Freezes you to the bone! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY Do I have that wrong...? $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY hold on. $ENTITY Don't panic. It's coming to me... $ENTITY Oh yeah. $ENTITY #x0;Winter Solstice... The winter soulfish must be something else. So, yeah. $ENTITY Enjoy the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , OK, $ENTITY ?
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY So $ENTITY it's $ENTITY and already dark...? $ENTITY Good. $ENTITY Just the way I like it. Everything smothered in gothiness. $ENTITY Long live the night, $ENTITY !
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY My most favorite part of the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is here, $ENTITY ! It's the dawn-to-dusk part. Love it! $ENTITY How can we tell that the sun never came today...once night falls? $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY blows the mind, $ENTITY .
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hard to tell now, $ENTITY but the sun never showed up today. I'd say it was a slacker, $ENTITY ... Except that I think it was just on vacation. $ENTITY Yeah, the sun deserves a day off once a year, $ENTITY .
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Pretty night, $ENTITY right, $ENTITY ? Awfully cold, though. $ENTITY It's extra frosty during the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY .
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY It's a special night, even if it's hard to see. It's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , which happens once each year. It's a day when the sun won't shine. Pretty neat.... I wouldn't mind that happening once a WEEK, $ENTITY .
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Out for a walk on a $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY night, $ENTITY huh, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY It's extra chilly tonight, $ENTITY that's for sure.
ZK Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Does it seem twice as dark tonight, $ENTITY or is it just me, ... It's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , so the sun didn't rise. But wouldn't it be crazy if the moon didn't rise, either? That'd be so cool. No sun, no moon. Just a black hole or something!... I know, $ENTITY I know, $ENTITY I'm a dreamer.
