FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Oh no!... it looks like you spilled something on your shirt!
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Oh, this? $ENTITY It's no big deal. $ENTITY Just some chili from earlier.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Aw, $ENTITY that's awful! $ENTITY Chili stains!
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Eh, $ENTITY I don't really care. $ENTITY I just wanted to try cooking again after so long... Last time wasn't my fault, ya know!
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY You made chili all by yourself? $ENTITY I was under the impression that... 
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY It's not canned! $ENTITY You just don't know how good I really am in the kitchen! $ENTITY Did you know I sneak a little hot pepper into my chili for that extra kick? $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ko
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY That sounds delicious! $ENTITY I don't normally like spicy food, $ENTITY but I do put onions in my chili.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY That sounds delicious! $ENTITY I like to put cheese, $ENTITY onions, $ENTITY tomatoes, $ENTITY and garlic in mine.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Onions? $ENTITY That must be why you cry all the time! $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY All that? $ENTITY That's not chili! $ENTITY That's stew! $ENTITY You can't just go changing decades of chili-making tradition!
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Does it even taste like chili if you do that?!... Hmm... . I'll have to try it and find out.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Hi, ... Have you been out fishing lately? $ENTITY I went fishing just the other day.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY I didn't think you $ENTITY were interested in fishing!
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Yes, I am! $ENTITY I'm just not very good at it. $ENTITY I was out there for three hours without catching a thing. $ENTITY Do you think I'm just missing that special fishing touch?! $ENTITY I'm sure you have it! I'd find another hobby.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY

FU 3P Ko $ENTITY

FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Pack a lunch, $ENTITY she says... 
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY It's OK. $ENTITY I'm happy to make enough for everyone!... , do you have any special requests?
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY I know how to pack my own lunch! $ENTITY Just for that, $ENTITY I think you SHOULD make mine. $ENTITY But don't put anything embarrassing in it, $ENTITY like those little pink cupcakes $ENTITY or those delicious cheesy fish.
FU 3P Ko $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY OK.... is there anything you'd like me to include in your lunch? $ENTITY Animal crackers. Chocolate hearts. Flower-cut carrots.
FU 3P Ko ... FINE. $ENTITY I guess I'll eat some of those animal crackers, $ENTITY so the rest of the bag doesn't get stale or anything.
FU 3P Ko ... OK. $ENTITY I guess if you just have to pack something for me, $ENTITY I wouldn't say no to some animal crackers.
FU 3P Ko ... OK. $ENTITY Since you're twisting my arm and all, $ENTITY I guess you could throw in a bag of those animal crackers I like.
