NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Oh, that's not why you're here? $ENTITY My post is here, $ENTITY so do let me know $ENTITY if and when you'd like to take a look around our showcase!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY To begin, I'll need to know your name!... Could you tell me ... ?
NPC Exhibition In our showcase, we have models of Happy Home Academy members' homes on display for all to enjoy!
NPC Exhibition If you activate $ENTITY StreetPass $ENTITY , you can share your home with other HHA members. And in turn, you'll also get to see their homes, including all their lovely furniture and such. $ENTITY Designs $ENTITY that you're wearing or displaying in your home will be displayed as well. Please keep in mind. And that goes double for your TPC information!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY OK! Care to activate $ENTITY StreetPass $ENTITY for $ENTITY Animal Crossing: New Leaf $ENTITY on this $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system... OK! No.

NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Excellent!... I'll be sure to get your StreetPass features rolling for you right away!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Oh... It looks like $ENTITY StreetPass $ENTITY cannot be activated for any more software titles on this $ENTITY system... . $ENTITY I'm sorry to say, $ENTITY but if you'd like to enter the showcase, you must first do a few things... Go to $ENTITY StreetPass Management $ENTITY in $ENTITY System Settings $ENTITY and deactivate StreetPass for other software. $ENTITY Once you've done that, I see no problem with letting you in.
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY All right! Thank you for waiting! $ENTITY From now on, you can exchange information via $ENTITY StreetPass $ENTITY ! $ENTITY StreetPass will continue to run even after you close the software, so please don't worry about anything. $ENTITY When you're tagged, $ENTITY you'll receive a note in $ENTITY Notifications $ENTITY on your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'll look forward to all your future visits!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Now that I have your name, let me briefly explain about our showcase. $ENTITY In our showcase, you can find model homes simulating the homes of Happy Home Academy members! Member information is exchanged via $ENTITY StreetPass... Based on that information, model homes will be displayed in the showcases of each player involved. This even includes a clone of you that talks to the other players. $ENTITY Isn't that fascinating?
NPC Exhibition Unfortunately, you haven't received data from other HHA members yet, so no model homes are displayed. But worry not! The arrival of new homes will not go unnoticed! $ENTITY We'll let you know via $ENTITY Notifications $ENTITY on your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system $ENTITY , $ENTITY so be watchful for them!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Well... it's probably better if you actually get a chance to see it! $ENTITY Allow me to show you around. Please come this way!
NPC Exhibition You'll have to activate $ENTITY StreetPass $ENTITY to look around our showcase. $ENTITY Care to activate StreetPass for $ENTITY Animal Crossing: New Leaf $ENTITY on this $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system... OK! No.

Your secretary, $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , is actually my twin sister! $ENTITY Oh the stories I could tell you about her! She got in so much trouble when she was a pup! $ENTITY Er, $ENTITY pardon me!... I seemed to have sidetracked our little conversation for a moment... 
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY OK, now that I have your name, let me explain what the HH Showcase is all about.
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY OK! It's so nice to meet you today, $ENTITY . $ENTITY !
NPC Exhibition ... Once again, thank you for visiting $ENTITY the $ENTITY HH Showcase... , since this is your first time visiting us, I'd like to briefly explain about our space here.
NPC Exhibition First of all, this is the entrance. $ENTITY There are three exhibition areas for you to view $ENTITY one to the left, one to the right, and one in the back. $ENTITY You can reference the $ENTITY Touch Screen $ENTITY for a detailed map!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY You're welcome to look around the model homes in the exhibition area. $ENTITY Also, you can buy any furniture in the model homes except for items that don't happen to be for sale.... The only real downside is that the price does tend to be a little higher than in regular stores... . $ENTITY But in return, you may end up finding rare items you can't find in this town! $ENTITY If you find anything you like, please place your order in the model home. We'll deliver it to you later!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Lastly, I've got one more important thing to tell you... If you see someone suspicious or find a model home that's not appropriate for public display... . $ENTITY please ask the person to leave, or go to the model home and request it be removed from the area. $ENTITY Once you've done that, we'll take care of the rest as soon as we can!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Well, I believe that's all from me!... I hope you enjoy your time in the HH Showcase!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Please enjoy your time looking around.
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Some home remodeling has also recently taken place, so be sure to go have a look!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Some home construction has also recently taken place, so be sure to go have a look!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Well, hello there! $ENTITY Can I assist you with anything at this time? $ENTITY I'd like to go home. Current model home. I have a question! Nope, nothing.
NPC Exhibition I see. $ENTITY Well, I'll be here if ever you need me!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY You'd like to know about the data provided from this town to other HHA members, is that right?
NPC Exhibition Currently, $ENTITY your house is being shown as the model home representing $ENTITY . And I thank you for it!
NPC Exhibition If you'd like to show the house of another member from this town... $ENTITY that member would have to come here personally so we can go through the necessary procedures!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Currently, $ENTITY 's house is the model being shown to represent ... . $ENTITY Would you like to change it so your $ENTITY house is shown as the model home? $ENTITY Yes, please! No, leave it as is.

NPC Exhibition Excellent. Understood!... I'll make the arrangements! $ENTITY 
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Thank you for your patience!... From now on, your house will be shown as the model home! $ENTITY I hope many members get to see it!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY What would you like to hear about?&#xF; $ENTITY ( This town's model. Other model homes. Ordering furniture. Blocking users. Never mind.
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY Would you like to hear about anything else?&#xF; $ENTITY This town's model. Other model homes. Ordering furniture. Blocking users. No, thank you.
NPC Exhibition From each town, there's one model home representing the town, and it gets shown to everyone! If you'd like to change the house representing your town, the process is fairly simple. Whoever wants to have their home represent $ENTITY just needs to come speak to me about it.
NPC Exhibition In our showcase, there's enough space to accommodate up to 48 model homes! When we run out of open space, the newer model homes will replace the old ones in order. If you'd like to keep displaying a specific house, be sure to use the $ENTITY Mark as favorite $ENTITY option!... If you want to move a model home to or from your favorites, use the sign in front of it. $ENTITY But keep in mind you can only mark up to 16 homes as your favorites. $ENTITY No more than that!
NPC Exhibition $ENTITY You're free to look inside the model homes here all you like. $ENTITY Plus, $ENTITY excluding some exceptions, $ENTITY you can purchase the furniture in the homes via mail-order service! If you'd like to buy an item, simply order it from the $ENTITY Touch Screen $ENTITY while you're in the house.
NPC Exhibition If you find someone suspicious or a model home that's rather inappropriate for public display... . $ENTITY be sure to ask that person to leave. $ENTITY You can also check the sign next to the home and request that it no longer be displayed in our town. When doing so, you can choose if the offensive person or home should be removed temporarily or forever. If the user is removed temporarily, he or she can return once you tag them via StreetPass again. If you choose to $ENTITY block $ENTITY the user forever, well, that's quite different. $ENTITY He or she won't be displayed in the showcase ever again, even if you tag them in the future. Please be aware that it may prevent you from seeing that same player's content in other games as well.
