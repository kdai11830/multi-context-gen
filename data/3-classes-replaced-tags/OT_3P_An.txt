OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, just calm down. You're making a fool of yourself in front of $ENTITY .
OT 3P An $ENTITY No, $ENTITY we're going to settle this! $ENTITY You know diddly-squat about rockin' hair! $ENTITY 
OT 3P An $ENTITY All I said was that I don't get why everyone thinks mohawks and pompadours are stylish. $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY , $ENTITY what did I say that's so wrong? $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY I'd rather have a pail of $ENTITY dumped on my head than.... rock those looks.
OT 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You did NOT just say that! $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , you settle this. $ENTITY Which do you think is cooler? $ENTITY Pompadour! Mohawk! Neither rocks.
OT 3P An $ENTITY Yeah! 'Cause the pompadour is.... is.... is like your brain's rockin' out SO hard that your hair explodes!
OT 3P An $ENTITY Totally! 'Cause the mohawk is like a rockin' shark fin, so everyone better watch out.... or you'll bite!
OT 3P An $ENTITY Well, I still think I'd prefer the pail of $ENTITY .
OT 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You're just messing with me, right, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Ugh, isn't there anyone who gets me in this town?
OT 3P An $ENTITY Well, I think you're the one who doesn't get ME. $ENTITY I rock as much as you do.... just not in my hair.
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY , you just wouldn't believe what $ENTITY is going on and on about now.... She says she's got some secret plan that's going to turn the town upside down.
OT 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, well.... it will! $ENTITY I'm going to paint every single $ENTITY on every single tree BLACK!
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, you are not. $ENTITY You're just a big talker. $ENTITY Why would you paint them black anyway?
OT 3P An $ENTITY Because I feel like it! $ENTITY And I'm going to do it just as soon.... as soon.... as the paint I ordered shows up!
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY do you take me for a silly $ENTITY or something? $ENTITY I'm not falling for all this. $ENTITY I'll be first in line for a piece of that black fruit.... if it ever actually happens, $ENTITY .
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, listen to this, ... here is bragging about what a fierce $ENTITY she is.
OT 3P An $ENTITY I'm not bragging. She just always takes it that way. $ENTITY But if you're interested, I'll tell you, ... I'd love to hear it! No way, bragger.
OT 3P An $ENTITY I made up a new kind of music that smashes $ENTITY and $ENTITY together. And that rockin' dog $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY said it was the most amazing thing he'd ever heard!
OT 3P An $ENTITY You know, since $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY is always taking breaks from his busy schedule to talk to her.... not.
OT 3P An $ENTITY I never said $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY took a break to visit me! $ENTITY I.... I.... just bumped into him somewhere. $ENTITY Really, it happened!
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, don't get so worked up, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I absolutely believe you.... not.
OT 3P An $ENTITY Ugh, you too? $ENTITY You'll all wish you'd known me better when I'm rockin' on the big stage someday.
OT 3P An $ENTITY Oh, I'm sorry, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I really hope you make it big. I'll be your number-one fan.... if you do.
