ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, it's you, ... Visiting TODAY? But how? How did you...? $ENTITY Wow, I could barely roll out of bed this morning. $ENTITY I guess I need the sun to fire up MY mojo.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 Oh, $ENTITY look $ENTITY at $ENTITY you. Up and at it early on such a DARK morning?! $ENTITY OK, bravo to you, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I can barely make my brain work on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY ! And here you are looking all sunny.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good morning, $ENTITY . Guess I made the right decision. I almost stayed in bed this morning! $ENTITY The sun is hibernating today, after all. Glad I didn't sleep in, $ENTITY or else I'd have missed YOU, $ENTITY !
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, good to see you, $ENTITY . Pretty weird atmosphere today, $ENTITY don't you think, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Kinda goth? Sorta noir? $ENTITY Whatever you call it, this day-is-night vibe should make things interesting.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY hi there, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Here we are, $ENTITY in $ENTITY , and the sun never rose. $ENTITY And so it won't set, either. I guess that means it's already night in a way. Weird... $ENTITY but good.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY . Think the day's kinda cold? Well, $ENTITY you haven't felt nothing yet... Actually, if it keeps getting colder, that may be pretty accurate. $ENTITY You won't be able to feel a thing!
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good evening, $ENTITY . Hey, excuse me for a second... $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY Done. $ENTITY It's freaky cold tonight, since the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is keeping the sun away. Stay warm, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Visiting $ENTITY on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Bold choice, traveling on an extra-nightish day.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Nice night, huh, $ENTITY ? Seems a little darker than usual, right? $ENTITY Fine by me, $ENTITY .
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY come to visit $ENTITY in the middle of the night, $ENTITY ? On such a COLD night too.
ZK AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY . I love nights like this. $ENTITY Late. $ENTITY Dark. $ENTITY Extra cold. $ENTITY You too, huh?
