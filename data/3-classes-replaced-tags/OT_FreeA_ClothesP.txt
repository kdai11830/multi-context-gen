OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY you're taking the whole "vintage" trend to a new level,... ! $ENTITY Is that really an authentic ... I kind of think that sort of thing belongs in a museum, $ENTITY not on your head.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Is that a real cow bone you're wearing,... ?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY WHAT? $ENTITY Ugh, $ENTITY do I really need to tell you why that's not appropriate?

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY 
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY That MUST be one of $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY 's hats, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Yikes, $ENTITY I'm getting dizzy...

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY that look you're wearing is classic $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY . $ENTITY I can tell because it makes me slightly nauseous. $ENTITY She certainly has her own "style," $ENTITY that's for sure... 
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Did $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY design your glasses?... That's what I thought. $ENTITY Word of advice:... avoid operating heavy machinery while you're wearing those things.

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Hey!... ! $ENTITY Snap out of it!... Oh, $ENTITY I just assumed you were sleepwalking. $ENTITY Why else would you walk around with $ENTITY on your face like that?

OT FreeA ClothesP And $ENTITY you're pulling it off. $ENTITY Not going to lie $ENTITY I'm jealous.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Cute outfit,... ! $ENTITY I used to do a little cheering back in my younger days, $ENTITY you know. $ENTITY Yep, $ENTITY we cheered hard for the old Fighting $ENTITY of $ENTITY . $ENTITY I never said it was a great name.
OT FreeA ClothesP Look, $ENTITY I don't want to seem like I don't respect moms or something. $ENTITY But that outfit you're wearing... It's a bit motherly. $ENTITY At this point, $ENTITY you might as well throw on some "mom jeans" and just own it.

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Bravo on the hat,... . $ENTITY Some people won't get it,... but this is how high-fashion trends get started. Just one bold person making a bold choice. $ENTITY , I love it!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Is that you? $ENTITY I can hardly see your face behind those giant $ENTITY .
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY There's nothing funny about corrective lenses, ... I don't find those glasses amusing. Ahhh... HA! $ENTITY I almost fooled you, $ENTITY didn't I? $ENTITY Those are great!... !
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Cute accessories, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I like the $ENTITY in particular. $ENTITY

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Oh my goodness, $ENTITY what have you done to your hair? $ENTITY

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY you got your hair done! $ENTITY Those are some lovely locks you're rocking,... . $ENTITY #x0;
OT FreeA ClothesP You did get that style on purpose, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY There wasn't some sort of mix-up at the salon?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY It's amazing how a new hairstyle can completely transform your look.... , $ENTITY I like it!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Well, hello there, $ENTITY "Princess $ENTITY "! $ENTITY 
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Or is that technically "Prince $ENTITY "?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Just don't expect me to bend the knee, "Your Royal Highness." ... 
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY 
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Did you wander into the wrong department at the costume shop again, $ENTITY dear? That's not to say it doesn't look good on you. $ENTITY It kind of works.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Did you get a new job that you're not telling me about, ... Well, $ENTITY then whose uniform is that?
OT FreeA ClothesP ?@
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY That's quite an unusual top you're wearing,... Be honest: $ENTITY Are you just wearing that to show off your muscles?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY wow, $ENTITY is it camisole season already? $ENTITY I get cold just thinking about wearing something like that.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY , you look like a rock star... or a celebrity... Or someone who's really good at thrift-store shopping!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY You've been wearing that a lot recently. $ENTITY Is the herd about to come in or something?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY This isn't the first time I've seen you walking around in that "outfit."... is everything OK?... I know getting dressed in the morning can be a chore, $ENTITY but come on!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Still haven't solved the mystery, $ENTITY eh,... If you keep this up, $ENTITY I'm going to have to report your fashion sense missing.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY I can see why you keep wearing that outfit. It looks comfortable, $ENTITY and it suits you. $ENTITY Plus, $ENTITY it's been a couple hundred years since that look was invented $ENTITY that means it's back in style!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY That outfit again,... Who are you, $ENTITY the Phantom of $ENTITY ?
OT FreeA ClothesP That costume looks good on you, $ENTITY but it makes me feel like I forgot to dress up for a party.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY , $ENTITY you're really into the $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY brand, $ENTITY aren't you? $ENTITY She uses color like a hyperactive monkey left alone with a set of finger paints, $ENTITY but it works!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY That hat again! $ENTITY You're acting like a famous actor who doesn't want to be spotted. $ENTITY Although... doesn't that technically make you an actual actor? $ENTITY My head hurts.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY If you're going to wear that outfit every day, $ENTITY can you at least start performing some nursely duties? $ENTITY The least you could do is write me a prescription for some $ENTITY !
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Do you need to do some laundry or something,... ? $ENTITY Those pj's are getting a lot of play.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY You know you don't have to wear that outfit every day, $ENTITY like you did when you were in school, $ENTITY right? I mean, $ENTITY it's cute, $ENTITY but there's a whole world of fashion for you to explore now.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY I'm going to have to take away your binky if you don't stop wearing that ridiculous outfit,... !
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY 
OT FreeA ClothesP You know, $ENTITY that outfit isn't going to seem as special on your actual wedding day if you wear it like this. $ENTITY Although... who am I kidding? $ENTITY A wedding dress on a guy is always going to be special.
OT FreeA ClothesP You know, $ENTITY that outfit isn't going to seem as special on your actual wedding day if you wear it like this.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY You're wearing that outfit again,... ? $ENTITY Are you setting up as a diving instructor or something?

OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Still bursting with school spirit, $ENTITY eh,... , $ENTITY I can't blame you for wearing that outfit every day.... It's cute!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Am I seeing things, $ENTITY or were you wearing the exact same outfit the other day? Hey, $ENTITY I get it. $ENTITY It's a lot of pressure to keep up with the trends.... Pick one style and run with it forever, $ENTITY right?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY on day one, $ENTITY that hat is cutting edge. $ENTITY On day two, it's... old hat.... Literally!
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY It's a shame to wear those big sunglasses when you have such a pretty face. $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY celebrities wear them to hide from the paparazzi. $ENTITY Who are you hiding from, $ENTITY ?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY , $ENTITY I'm sorry. $ENTITY It's just impossible not to laugh at those ridiculous glasses. $ENTITY Do they improve your vision? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY then maybe you should take a good look in the mirror! $ENTITY Ha!
OT FreeA ClothesP I like the ... but the trick to accessorizing is to mix things up a little bit.
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY 
OT FreeA ClothesP ... are you OK? $ENTITY It seems like you always have some new injury. Be a little more careful at $ENTITY practice, $ENTITY all right?
OT FreeA ClothesP ... are you OK? $ENTITY It seems like you always have some new injury. Be a little more careful at $ENTITY practice, $ENTITY all right?
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Weren't you wearing that the other day? $ENTITY #xE;It's a little gimmicky if you ask me. $ENTITY Wear it too often and people might start referring to you as the " $ENTITY #x0;."
OT FreeA ClothesP $ENTITY Getting your money's worth out of that outfit, $ENTITY aren't you?... ! That's OK.... If you find something that works, $ENTITY I say stick with it.
