HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Yeah, this area's kind of empty... If I had a ton of money, I would build a huge gym here! $ENTITY Unfortunately, all my Bells are tied up in petunia-protein futures right now. $ENTITY .
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Hey! It looks like somebody's new house is going up in this area. $ENTITY I wonder who's moving in. $ENTITY Ha ha! Doesn't matter! Whoever it is, I'll be sure to offer my training services right away, ... 
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY So what are you doing over near my place, ... Aha! You're planning on digging a bunch of holes for me to fall into, aren't you? $ENTITY Ha ha! Well, as much as I appreciate the ol' falling-into-holes workout, I think I'll pass. $ENTITY 
HA FreeB Spot Why are you hanging out near $ENTITY 's house? Are you two planning something? $ENTITY Give me a shout if you're getting a game together or something!
HA FreeB Spot Living in a tent... You're pretty outdoorsy, huh? $ENTITY What? You're just living in it temporarily until your house gets built? I guess I understand. $ENTITY Living in a tent is really gutsy, $ENTITY but at the end of the day you want a nice house to live in, $ENTITY .
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY You're planning on expanding your house, aren't you? $ENTITY I have big expectations! And if you put in a gym, you better believe I'll be by every day, $ENTITY !
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Has your house gotten bigger? $ENTITY You have some hidden rooms in there, don't you?! I just know it! $ENTITY How dare you keep secrets from your buddies, $ENTITY !
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY You live in a pretty big house, huh? $ENTITY How would you feel about turning it into my personal training center? $ENTITY What?! You'd charge an annual membership fee? $ENTITY Forget it then!
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Your house is really big! The other day, $ENTITY and I came by just to check it out. $ENTITY I even took a picture as a keepsake! $ENTITY Ha ha! It's a tourist attraction and you didn't even know it! $ENTITY 
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY wilder than I thought... Wow! All of a sudden I have a new rival!
HA FreeB Spot Hmm... 's house... I bet if we yell real loud, we can get ... #x0; $ENTITY to come out. $ENTITY Heeeeeeeeeeeey!... Huh. No answer. $ENTITY .
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Hey! Should we crash $ENTITY 's place? $ENTITY Knowing $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY probably taking a nap right now, ... It's probably cruel to wake ... #x0; $ENTITY up right now. Yeah, let's forget it.
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY When did $ENTITY 's place get so big? $ENTITY I bet it's even big enough for me to practice $ENTITY in there... I think I'm gonna ask if I can try that sometime, $ENTITY !
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY 's place is so huge! $ENTITY A big house gives you a lot of space to breathe. $ENTITY Now that I think about it, $ENTITY does seem more cool and collected these days!
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY The ocean is so much fun, isn't it? The wind feels really good here!
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY What kind of things can you sell at $ENTITY Re-Tail... I'm thinking about taking my old $ENTITY in, ... 
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Cyrus $ENTITY took care of me at Re-Tail the other day! $ENTITY He is so cool! $ENTITY Trickling sweat! Rugged hands! He's a true master of his craft! $ENTITY And soooo manly! $ENTITY !
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY I get a weird feeling when I run into someone near the station. I don't know what it is. $ENTITY Maybe I'm feeling guilty because I haven't gone to see my mom in a while. $ENTITY .
HA FreeB Spot The dock smells like a rough-and- tumble old man. $ENTITY I can picture him gazing out at the sea, his hands in his pockets... What a magnificent pose! $ENTITY Too smooth, old man! $ENTITY Too smooth... 
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY I couldn't help but notice you're near a police station. Did you do something bad?! $ENTITY What? Me? $ENTITY I've got no reason to have a guilty conscience! $ENTITY Police stations make me nervous even when I'm on my best behavior! ... 
HA FreeB Spot After a nice jog, I like to have some coffee at a coffee shop before heading home. $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY knows exactly what I like! $ENTITY I appreciate that kind of attention to detail. $ENTITY .
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY Being near the town hall certainly reminds me... If your mayor job gets too tough, I can step in anytime. $ENTITY My first order of business would be to get folks to exercise more. We need more sports cred in this town!
HA FreeB Spot $ENTITY The area in front of the town hall is a perfect spot for an exercise yard. Seriously! $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You could even put in a basketball court or a small soccer pitch... But $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY will go Isabellistic if you break a window!
