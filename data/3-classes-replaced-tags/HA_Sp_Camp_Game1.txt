HA Sp Camp_Game1 $ENTITY Hey! Let's play a game! I call it... Price Fixer! It's not as bad as it sounds... sometimes. $ENTITY There are cards with numbers from 1 through 8! $ENTITY I'll draw one card from these, and you'll guess the number. $ENTITY If you guess close, I'll sell you my $ENTITY for a good price! $ENTITY But if your guess is far from the target, you'll have to buy it for a higher price, all right? $ENTITY Do you understand the rules? $ENTITY Are you ready? $ENTITY #x0; Sure! Not now.
