GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Well, good evening to you! $ENTITY Hey! Did I fake you out?... Because it's still MORNING! Yeah, it's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY today!... Wow, it's going to be super weird being dark all day, $ENTITY .
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, hey, HEY $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Are you freaking out as much as I am this morning, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY The sun never rose! And it's not going to today! Because it's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY ! CRAZY!
GE Ai MidWinter1 Good morning! $ENTITY Yeah, no joke! It's morning! But it's still, like, night, right? It's going to be dark all... day... long. Because it's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY I guess this whole $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY thing means it's dark even in the middle of the day, $ENTITY . $ENTITY That means I'll have to shine extra bright today to light up $ENTITY ! Right, $ENTITY ?
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Woohoo $ENTITY ! It'll be like night all day long today! Know what that means, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY We gotta burn the candle at both ends today, and dance like there's no tomorrow, $ENTITY !
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY How's it going today? Have you heard the sun's not coming up today, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Of course, that means it's not going down either. It'll be night all day long! How weird is THAT?
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hey, good evening, ... Wait... if it was dark this morning, can I still say good evening tonight? $ENTITY The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY always makes me super confused, $ENTITY !
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Today's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , so the sun never rose today. It's like it had a bad-hair day and didn't show up!
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Woohoo... Can you BELIEVE it? This has been, like, the longest night ever. $ENTITY The sun didn't come up today! I love the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY . It's like an upside-down kinda day!
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Not too many hours left in the most awesome night of the year, $ENTITY ! The sun hasn't come up in forever. But it will eventually. $ENTITY So enjoy the super nightiness while it lasts!
GE Ai MidWinter1 $ENTITY Woohoo... I love the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY . You know why, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Because the forecast is "dark with no chance of light"! Hahaha!
