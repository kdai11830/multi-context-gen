OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I can't believe $ENTITY is reading $ENTITY Maybe he's just using it for weight lifting... 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY What's more likely? $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY using this $ENTITY to clean? $ENTITY Or him filling it with water and doing one-arm curls?
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY So $ENTITY has ... just sitting in his room like it's no big deal. $ENTITY He probably thinks it's an ancient pull-up bar or something.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY In $ENTITY 's place? $ENTITY Are we in the wrong house?
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I'm not sure what $ENTITY was thinking when he installed this $ENTITY here... I probably shouldn't be so quick to assume he was thinking.

OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY So this is where $ENTITY hangs out when he's not at $ENTITY practice... 
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY It's a little bit rude to snoop around $ENTITY 's place like this. $ENTITY Fortunately, I'm OK with being a little bit rude.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Is $ENTITY 's favorite food $ENTITY I smell it everywhere in here! $ENTITY Now I'm hungry, $ENTITY and I'm not sure where he's hiding all the $ENTITY !
OT FreeC Furniture_Ha Don't mind me.... I'm just rifling through $ENTITY 's prized possessions...
