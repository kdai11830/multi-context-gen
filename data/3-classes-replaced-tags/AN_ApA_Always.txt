AN ApA Always Hey. $ENTITY I've got a question for ya... You know some songs are all, like, "Baby, you got a place in my heart"? $ENTITY How big a place do you think we're talking about specifically? $ENTITY Cookie jar Studio apartment
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY That's tiny! $ENTITY I mean, why even bother?! $ENTITY That's not much of a commitment at all! $ENTITY If a guy sang that song to me... I'd kick him to the curb with quickness!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Hmm... $ENTITY Not much room in that old heart... Could be a tight squeeze! $ENTITY You'd have to work really hard just to get in there. $ENTITY With, like, flowers and stuff... Makes me nauseous!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Oh, it's like that, huh?... Not too big, not too small. $ENTITY It's like... $ENTITY just right! $ENTITY I guess that's OK if you're the one trying to get in. $ENTITY It's like you're a salesman, and they just let you in!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Wha? $ENTITY Bit big, don't ya think? $ENTITY A whole person would fit! $ENTITY It's like you're just letting them take over! $ENTITY People gotta be careful! $ENTITY I feel like I gotta warn 'em! $ENTITY Watch out! $ENTITY I'm feelin' a little preachy!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What? $ENTITY That's huge! $ENTITY And... kinda suspicious!... It's gotta be a trap! $ENTITY Like someone is trying to lure you into their heart!... That's... creepy.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Man, that's a lot to think about... Thanks for the info! $ENTITY !
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Hey, I'm doing a survey! It's on... light levels while sleeping! $ENTITY How bright do you like it at bedtime? $ENTITY Bright as the sun Pitch black

AN ApA Always $ENTITY The other day with $ENTITY , we were talking about having a fun get-together this $ENTITY . $ENTITY Where should we have it? $ENTITY ( The beach. The mountains. The river. Somewhere inside!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY The beach in $ENTITY , huh... Sounds classy. $ENTITY And convenient! $ENTITY I like it!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY The mountains in $ENTITY , huh... ? Yeah, man! We could eat some good farm-fresh foods while we're at it! $ENTITY Doesn't seem like we'd get many troublemakers up there either!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY A $ENTITY barbecue by the river!... Great idea! Fresh fish for everyone! $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Heh. $ENTITY Actually the river's always just a few steps away in this town. $ENTITY That'll make things easy!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY That's a weird attitude! $ENTITY I can't believe someone from $ENTITY would even say that! $ENTITY Then again, I suppose everyone just feels like staying inside sometimes.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY The other day with $ENTITY , we got to talkin' about where's a good place to hold a summer gathering. $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY ( The beach! The mountains! The river! Somewhere inside!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Of course!... In summer you gotta go to the beach! $ENTITY It's close too!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Summer in the mountains sounds... pretty rugged. $ENTITY But it's probably nice and cool at least.... Might be nice!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY At night there'd be lots of fireflies and stuff. That'd be cool! $ENTITY Oh! And, hey, $ENTITY it's easy to get to the river in this town, ha ha!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Whoa! What's with that talk?! $ENTITY I can't believe someone from $ENTITY would even say that! $ENTITY It's summer, man! You can even be outside at night!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY The other day with $ENTITY , we got to talkin' about where's a good place to hold a winter gathering. $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY ( The beach! The mountains! The river! Not outdoors!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY The beach in winter... Man, where do you get your interesting ideas? $ENTITY I guess we'd have awe-inspiring scenery... And it's not too far away.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Whaaah... ? Mountains in the winter? $ENTITY I mean, I bet there's probably lots of fun stuff to do... But it's cold and dangerous! We'd need to get everyone geared up... 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Ooh! Nice! Cooking up fish on the grill and stuff, right? $ENTITY But you'd have to be sure to bundle up and stay nice and warm... 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Come on! Where's your grit? I can't believe someone from $ENTITY would ever say that! $ENTITY Still... it'll be super cold, so I guess I can understand.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You wanna know what sort of gathering we'd be having? $ENTITY It's, uh... seminar! $ENTITY But I have no idea what we'd actually do there!... !

AN ApA Always $ENTITY Hmmm... Way to go big, man! $ENTITY And even if you don't take first place, I bet you'll be right up in the mix!
AN ApA Always Hey, that's kind of a low ranking, don't you think? $ENTITY You gotta have confidence, dude! $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY was totally saying, "I'm always gonna be first!" $ENTITY You can't let that stand, right?
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Hmmm... Yeah, I guess that's an OK assessment for now. $ENTITY I mean, you don't wanna be too arrogant, right?

AN ApA Always I'm just gonna be lost without my $ENTITY Underwater! $ENTITY The huge page count really sold it.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY 
AN ApA Always I guess with that sort of content, there was no need to be weekly... They probably just burned out.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Course, printing 1,000 pages of content on that topic... $ENTITY Yeah, that was maybe a little crazy. $ENTITY It was so thick, I got a workout just carrying it around... 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Waaaahh... ! What am I gonna read now? $ENTITY ?
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY So I'm thinking I might, like, get myself a pet! $ENTITY 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What sort of animal do you think would make a good pet for me?... . Pelican. Raccoon. Hedgehog.
AN ApA Always ... Huh!... You sure? ... I've heard that $ENTITY can be touchy... They don't always take a liking to people right away, you know?
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Pelican?! $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY That's a bold choice. $ENTITY The tough thing about keeping a pelican is... I hear they have some pretty bad mood swings.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY A raccoon?! $ENTITY Man, raccoons... I get this funny feeling, like, if you showed a raccoon some cash, they might just jump you... Wonder why.
AN ApA Always $ENTITY A hedgehog?! $ENTITY Yeah, yeah! $ENTITY That'd be so cool! $ENTITY I could, like, teach it to mend my clothes and stuff while I'm asleep... Well, $ENTITY that might be pushing it!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY What sort of animal do you think would make a good pet for me?... #x0;... . Owl. Alpaca. Turtle.
AN ApA Always ... What?!... W-well, I guess $ENTITY could be interesting. $ENTITY Might be a good challenge, but... Do they bite much?
AN ApA Always $ENTITY An owl?! $ENTITY Do you think owls are really as smart as people say they are or what? $ENTITY I feel like they'd always be asking me annoying science questions... 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Oooh, alpaca! $ENTITY Nice! $ENTITY But I hear alpacas spit some nasty loogies when they get scared... Oh! $ENTITY I bet if it was a pink alpaca, it would smell sooo awesome! $ENTITY Gotta have one, ... 
AN ApA Always $ENTITY WHAT?! $ENTITY A turtle?! $ENTITY That is really out there, man! $ENTITY That must be an insane challenge! $ENTITY How do you even raise one... Seems like too much of a hassle... $ENTITY I'm out!
AN ApA Always $ENTITY Wow... It's a lot harder to choose than I thought. $ENTITY Course $ENTITY it's not the sort of decision you want to rush! $ENTITY !
