GE 3P An $ENTITY Can I get your opinion on something, $ENTITY ? I'm, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY totally set to become the next big superstar... But I really need to set myself apart from the other wannabes. $ENTITY Do you think I need a gimmick?
GE 3P An $ENTITY 
GE 3P An $ENTITY A gimmick, huh? Most pop stars are desperate for attention. $ENTITY Maybe you could be all reclusive instead! $ENTITY Refuse to do any interviews or let anyone take your photo. $ENTITY It'll drive your fans crazy $ENTITY they'll adore you!
GE 3P An $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I get it! You think I should play hard to get, huh? $ENTITY That's a totally brilliant idea! $ENTITY It's just like my mom told me. $ENTITY Always leave 'em wanting more,... 
GE 3P An $ENTITY A gimmick, $ENTITY eh? $ENTITY Maybe you should write your own songs! $ENTITY I hear that singer-songwriters are popular!
GE 3P An $ENTITY That's, like, the most brilliant idea I've ever heard! $ENTITY Imagine me, an award-winning singer-songwriter. $ENTITY My fans will totally $ENTITY ADORE me! $ENTITY All I have to do now $ENTITY is finally learn how to play the zither...
GE 3P An $ENTITY Why do you need a gimmick? If you have enough raw talent, $ENTITY you don't need to fool anyone into liking you! $ENTITY Just put your heart and soul into your silly pop songs, $ENTITY and that should be enough for your $ENTITY REAL fans.
GE 3P An $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY My. $ENTITY Gosh. $ENTITY You're the most brilliant animal in this town. $ENTITY Why pretend to be something I'm not? $ENTITY I'm just going to be myself. $ENTITY If anyone has any complaints about that, $ENTITY they can just talk to the hand!
GE 3P An $ENTITY I don't really understand your wacky $ENTITY pop-star lifestyle, but if my advice helped you out, $ENTITY consider me happy!
GE 3P An $ENTITY You are wise beyond your years. $ENTITY When I make it big, $ENTITY I'll totally dedicate a song to you, OK?
GE 3P An $ENTITY Hey there! $ENTITY I'm thinking about starting an advice column. $ENTITY Isn't that clever? $ENTITY You can be my first case! $ENTITY How about I give you some advice about $ENTITY how to, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY be more popular?
GE 3P An $ENTITY Uh... What do you mean, $ENTITY be more popular? $ENTITY I'm pretty popular already, aren't I?
GE 3P An $ENTITY Oh, don't get all sensitive! I just mean I can give you tips on $ENTITY how to, $ENTITY you know, $ENTITY be more girly!
GE 3P An $ENTITY I'm not sure why I need to be more girly, $ENTITY but go ahead. $ENTITY I can't wait to hear this!
GE 3P An $ENTITY 
GE 3P An $ENTITY This is going to be my biggest challenge! $ENTITY For starters, $ENTITY you need to bat your eyelashes more. $ENTITY Everyone knows that girly girls have $ENTITY really heavy eyelashes, and we have to bat them a lot. $ENTITY It's, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY science.
GE 3P An $ENTITY Eyelashes, $ENTITY huh? $ENTITY I seriously can't ever picture myself $ENTITY batting my eyelashes. $ENTITY Mine aren't that heavy! $ENTITY How about giving me some really useful advice instead? $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY showing me how to change a tire?
GE 3P An $ENTITY The best way to be a girly girl is to make everyone open the door for you. $ENTITY Never open a door yourself! $ENTITY Just stand there in front of a closed door $ENTITY until someone opens it for you. $ENTITY Anything else would be... uncouth!
GE 3P An $ENTITY No way! Why would I let someone open the door for me $ENTITY when I can just do it myself? $ENTITY Plus, $ENTITY opening doors is really good for hand-eye coordination. $ENTITY Maybe I'm not cut out $ENTITY to be a girly girl!
GE 3P An $ENTITY I was just wondering, $ENTITY ... $ENTITY Do you have a nightly beauty routine? It's so very important!
GE 3P An $ENTITY A nightly routine? $ENTITY Not so much for beauty, $ENTITY but I do like to practice my swing every night!
GE 3P An $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY what? $ENTITY Your swing?
GE 3P An $ENTITY 
GE 3P An $ENTITY Yep! I like to practice swinging my bug net around. $ENTITY It helps me stay in top bug-catching condition!
GE 3P An $ENTITY Yep! I like to practice casting out my fishing line. $ENTITY Just a swing of the arm and boom $ENTITY you've got a fish!
GE 3P An $ENTITY Yep! $ENTITY I like to practice swinging my axe. $ENTITY You never know when you're going to need $ENTITY to chop down a tree!
GE 3P An $ENTITY Umm... OK. I guess it's important for everyone to have a nightly routine, $ENTITY no matter WHAT it is. $ENTITY But I just don't think I could live without moisturizing every night! $ENTITY To each her own, $ENTITY huh?
GE 3P An $ENTITY I guess we both just like to stay in tip-top shape!
