AN 3P An $ENTITY It's like I'm saying, everyone's got a good side... and a little bit of a bad side to 'em, right?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Hey, ... You know what a stage name is? $ENTITY 'Cause I thought of a great one!
AN 3P An ... You know what? $ENTITY I totally need to learn a special move! $ENTITY #
AN 3P An $ENTITY Huh. $ENTITY So if a bad guy, like, turns around... does that make him turn into a good guy?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, I 'spose it would!... Wait. $ENTITY So what happens if you look at 'em from the side?
AN 3P An $ENTITY They'd be half good and half bad? ... Dude, that's weird! $ENTITY That'd be like mixing $ENTITY and eating ... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Man, that's the worst... How would you even react to a mix like that?
AN 3P An $ENTITY 'Cause even a really bad guy eating $ENTITY would kinda look like a good guy, right... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Totally! $ENTITY !
AN 3P An $ENTITY Stage name? $ENTITY Oh, right! $ENTITY Like a name you give yourself to sound cooler. $ENTITY So?... What'd you come up with?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Heh... "... "!... Cool, right?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Uh, I dunno... It's not exactly clever! $ENTITY You need something unique that no one's thought of before!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Hmmm... Well, how about " $ENTITY "?... "! $ENTITY And you could be "... "!... #xE;, of course you'd be... "!... What do you think? $ENTITY Nice! Lame! ...
AN 3P An ... Quit messin' around! $ENTITY She'll never stop if you encourage her! ... Who wants to be called " $ENTITY #xE;
AN 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY That's a great name! $ENTITY "... "! $ENTITY I'm sure no one's taken it yet!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Hmm... Maybe " $ENTITY " isn't so bad. $ENTITY You think I'd be the first person to use it? Wait! $ENTITY No, no, no!... Stop trying to trick me! ... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY Do NOT encourage her, ... I don't care if it's unique! I don't wanna be ... Is that what I look like?!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY 'Cause it seems like there'd be some sort of secret superpower built into having a name like that. Just think about it for a minute... " $ENTITY #xE;
AN 3P An $ENTITY Mmm, maybe. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY we're talking about $ENTITY here, so... Whoa! $ENTITY That was too close! $ENTITY You almost got me on board! ... 
AN 3P An ... You're not seriously $ENTITY thinking about this, are you?! It's just a joke!... I mean, " $ENTITY "? What does that even mean?! $ENTITY This is not really up for consideration!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Actually, I'm totally serious... .
AN 3P An $ENTITY Ugh... .
AN 3P An $ENTITY A special move? $ENTITY You mean like $ENTITY summoning a cactus or a swarm of marshmallow bees or something?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY exactly! $ENTITY Or cartwheeling at the speed of light is a good one too! $ENTITY I wonder if one day $ENTITY you just wake up, and your special move is ready to go...
AN 3P An $ENTITY Special move... You mean, like, something a wizard teaches you?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, that's what I'm thinkin'! $ENTITY Like, some old magic dude who was an adventurer when he was young! $ENTITY I loved that stuff when I was a kid. I used to pester this old neighbor guy with a billion questions!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Special move... Like a forbidden technique that knocks you out when you use it?
AN 3P An $ENTITY Ooh, $ENTITY yeah yeah! $ENTITY And when you use it, $ENTITY strange markings mysteriously appear on your forehead! $ENTITY Heh, I thought that was so cool when I was little. $ENTITY One time I drew on my forehead in permanent ink!
AN 3P An $ENTITY In comics and stuff it seems like you learn your special move for the first time when you get into big trouble. $ENTITY Like, you get in a tight spot, and all of a sudden you realize you have a special power or something... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, yeah! $ENTITY So to get your power, first you gotta get scared... or angry! $ENTITY Like maybe if your friends or family members are in mortal danger... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Family... 
AN 3P An $ENTITY Friends... Oh! $ENTITY Uh... Hey, ... You wouldn't happen to be in mortal danger right now, would you? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY So much mortal danger. Nah, I'm mortally good. ...
AN 3P An $ENTITY Oooh! $ENTITY We got one! $ENTITY A friend in the mortalest of mortal danger! $ENTITY Hrm... Frankly, $ENTITY it'd really help sell it if you were a little more roughed up and stuff, $ENTITY !
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, yeah! $ENTITY And you should show up out of nowhere and be like... "They got me!" $ENTITY That would do the trick! $ENTITY Haha, yeah, that would be totally awesome! $ENTITY !
AN 3P An $ENTITY What, really? $ENTITY Are you sure? $ENTITY Just a smidge of mortal danger maybe? $ENTITY Aw, man! ... You know, I don't think I ever see anyone in town who needs any kind of saving!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Yeah, worst thing in $ENTITY is, like, getting stung by a bee or falling in a hole... Or maybe overeating! $ENTITY But there's never anything that would really awaken any secret powers in ya!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Are you trying to learn a special move too? $ENTITY Aw, man! $ENTITY I bet everyone in $ENTITY is! $ENTITY And meanwhile everything is peaceful!
AN 3P An $ENTITY Hahaha! $ENTITY I got it!... When $ENTITY is threatened, the three of us can join forces and fight! $ENTITY Our combined special moves will awaken all at once, and there'll be no stopping us! $ENTITY !
