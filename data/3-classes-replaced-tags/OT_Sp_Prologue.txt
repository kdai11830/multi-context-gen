OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Don't delay, Mayor! Head straight to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY to get started!
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY I know you'll like it here, Mayor. $ENTITY It's not much, but it's going to be great now that you're here.

OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Sweet $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You're our new mayor, $ENTITY aren't you? $ENTITY I wasn't at the station when you first got here, $ENTITY so we haven't been introduced. $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY .

OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY if it isn't the new mayor I've heard so much about! Nice to finally meet you. $ENTITY Even if it is a little late. $ENTITY You've never visited with me since you came to town. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY let's put all THAT in the past and start fresh. $ENTITY I'm ... .

Anyway, I'm glad to give you lots of advice. So come chat with me anytime, $ENTITY . I'll help you get all settled into life here.
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Why, if it isn't our new neighbor!... That's you, right? Just moved to $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well, of course it is! I can spot a new face from all the way across town, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY , and people around here say that I'm a little bit of a know-it-all. $ENTITY Well, I really do know it all, so I take it as a compliment! Feel free to chat with me about anything. $ENTITY Anyway, I'll be seeing you around town, $ENTITY .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Oh! It's you! Our new neighbor! Well, I haven't introduced myself yet. $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY , and I'm positively sure we're going to get along like we've known each other forever. $ENTITY Yes, welcome to $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's a small town, but it just got one neighbor bigger. $ENTITY Ask me for $ENTITY anything, $ENTITY anytime. $ENTITY I'm always glad to help out a new friend, $ENTITY .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY We haven't met yet, have we? $ENTITY Well, not formally anyway. $ENTITY But I know who you are.... Mayor! I was at the tree ceremony. $ENTITY Oh, it was so inspiring. I know our town is going to grow even lovelier! $ENTITY My name is $ENTITY , and I look forward to seeing what you're going to do with $ENTITY !
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY We haven't met yet, $ENTITY have we? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY not formally anyway. $ENTITY But I know who you are.... Mayor! $ENTITY Remember your first day here in ...

OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Have you been to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY yet? You should really go there before anything else. $ENTITY Everyone does that when they move here, $ENTITY .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY You haven't found yourself a place to live yet, $ENTITY have you? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I can tell. $ENTITY You have that look in your eyes that says one thing:... Where am I going to sleep? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY trust me. Head across the tracks to our Main Street and go to $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Haven't found a plot of land to call your own yet? $ENTITY Well, keep at it, $ENTITY . You should be picky when it comes to where to put your house. $ENTITY I wish I'd been pickier. Good thing I like my neighbors, because I don't like my view. $ENTITY Good luck, $ENTITY .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY You found the perfect place to put your home, didn't you! $ENTITY You've got a good eye, $ENTITY . $ENTITY But have you given your address to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY yet? $ENTITY No? $ENTITY Oh, you have to do that. Run along now, $ENTITY !
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY 
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY You're all settled in now, $ENTITY aren't you, ... Well, $ENTITY now comes the real question.... How do you want to decorate?... Because whether you're in a tent or a mansion, $ENTITY you have options. $ENTITY Go see $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY on $ENTITY Main Street $ENTITY for all kinds of furniture and other knickknacks. $ENTITY And if you want to upgrade the look of your homeor make it bigger... Nook's Homes $ENTITY is the place to visit.
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Ever heard that saying $ENTITY "spending money like it grows on trees"?... In our town, you can. Shake $ENTITY tree and then carry the fruit to the $ENTITY recycling shop... You can sell it there! $ENTITY To shake a tree, $ENTITY face it and then press . $ENTITY To pick up things on the ground? $ENTITY Press . Oh, $ENTITY you'll find shells on the beach you can sell too. $ENTITY Nature is SO amazing,... .
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Your place is probably still half empty, $ENTITY isn't it? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it won't be for long. $ENTITY You'd be surprised how packed your little place will be soon enough. $ENTITY You'll want to get rid of some things because they don't match your sense of style. $ENTITY But don't throw them away.... Sell them at $ENTITY Re-Tail... Those alpacas will buy just about anything: $ENTITY furniture, $ENTITY fruit, $ENTITY shells, $ENTITY fish, $ENTITY and even insects.... You'll clear space in your house and have more money to spend on your home dcor!
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY I'll make this short. There are two ways to make a lot of Bells around here, $ENTITY . First, by catching insects and fish. $ENTITY So buy a $ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY and a $ENTITY net $ENTITY . You can sell what you catch. Second, by digging wherever you see those marks. $ENTITY Buy a $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY and then get to work. You can sell your finds at $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY , but you can also donate them to $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY . He wants bugs, fish, and other special things for his museum. $ENTITY That owl's got a good heart. But he won't pay you a single Bell.... Are you the charitable type? $ENTITY We're getting ahead of ourselves. Buy yourself a net, a fishing rod, and a shovel. $ENTITY J
OT Sp Prologue If I could bother you, $ENTITY ? How do you think this looks? $ENTITY 
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Tell me, $ENTITY , where did you decide to live?... Just over there. A ways off. Far, far away.
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY That reminds me! Have you read the $ENTITY bulletin board $ENTITY yet? $ENTITY The one next to the train station?... Yes, I have. Not yet. What board?
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY 
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY I've got some big advice for you. It's the most important thing I'll ever tell you,... . Be sure to save your game before you stop playing. $ENTITY If you don't, $ENTITY it's like that day never happened. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY what if I gave you a present? $ENTITY It'd just be GONE if you didn't save.... So save every time you stop playing. $ENTITY Then we'll all be happy. $ENTITY Do you know how to save? $ENTITY Press $ENTITY START $ENTITY , $ENTITY and then select $ENTITY Save and quit $ENTITY . If you'd rather keep playing, $ENTITY select $ENTITY Save and continue $ENTITY . $ENTITY But just don't forget to save before you quit, $ENTITY OK?

Keep chatting with all of us too. We'll have advice, requests, and other useful things to tell you. And don't forget $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY at the town hall.

OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY I'm VERY choosy when it comes to clothes. What do you think? $ENTITY Perfect Ugh
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Really? Perfectly perfect?!... Oh, that IS a compliment. I think I'll definitely keep this then! $ENTITY ;
OT Sp Prologue Only semiperfect? Somewhat perfect? Sort of perfect? $ENTITY Hmm. I guess that's good enough. $ENTITY I can be hard on myself, especially when it comes to looking my best, $ENTITY . I think I'll keep wearing this anyway. $ENTITY Thank you for the compliment, $ENTITY . $ENTITY ;
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Really? I usually don't shoot for an in-the-middle kind of look. Hmmm. Just so-so.... ? $ENTITY You're going to be a hard one to please, aren't you? $ENTITY Well, I'll keep this look a little longer. $ENTITY ;
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY Well, that's honesty for you. Not a big fan of this look? $ENTITY Hmm. I think I'll keep this style a little longer anyway. I don't want to be.... quick to judge. $ENTITY &lt;
OT Sp Prologue $ENTITY No! That bad? That HORRIBLE?! $ENTITY How can it be? I'm usually so careful. $ENTITY Even finicky! Thank you for being SO honest. Otherwise, the whole town would have seen me in this trash!... &lt;
