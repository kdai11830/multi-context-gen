OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Hey, guys! $ENTITY Glad you could both make it.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY hey, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Looks like you found $ENTITY for me.
OT Q04 3P_Ko ... You're back already!
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY ? $ENTITY What are you doing here?... Oh yeah, $ENTITY I totally forgot... That was forever ago! $ENTITY Oh well. $ENTITY I'm just glad you were able to find $ENTITY .
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Yo, $ENTITY You need something from me or something?... ?
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY What's this all about,... I don't like surprises. $ENTITY Unless it's a surprise I was expecting, $ENTITY you know?
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY what's going on? $ENTITY It must be important since you sent $ENTITY to find me. $ENTITY Right,... 
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY it's not too exciting, $ENTITY but I found something of yours and I wanted to give it back. $ENTITY I can't even remember how long ago I borrowed this. $ENTITY Sorry,... !
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Well,... ! ... All this time I thought it was under a pile of clothes in my room. $ENTITY You're all right, $ENTITY you know that?
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY You've been wanting one of these, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I know it's not your birthday or anything, $ENTITY but I found one for you while I was shopping.
OT Q04 3P_Ko ... you bought ... That's so thoughtful of you.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I know you're pretty careful with your things, $ENTITY but I found this just lying on the street. $ENTITY Isn't it yours,... I figured you'd want me to rescue it for you.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY is that really my old ... I never thought I'd see it again. $ENTITY The collection just hasn't been the same without it. $ENTITY Thank you,... This means a lot.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY You're going to laugh at me for this, $ENTITY but I had a bizarre dream last night. $ENTITY You were the captain of a vacation space cruiser that was about to visit Neptune for more party ice. $ENTITY And sometimes even weird dreams have meanings... so I wanted to make sure you weren't moving away!
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY come on $ENTITY . You should know there's no water ice on Neptune! $ENTITY Only methane and ammonia ice, $ENTITY duh. $ENTITY You really called me over here to tell me about that? $ENTITY Have you been hearing voices or anything? $ENTITY Here's a tip: $ENTITY don't do what the voices tell you to do.... Unless they tell you to bake me a pie.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY my lights have been flickering and I thought maybe you could help fix them. But just before you got here, $ENTITY they started working normally again. $ENTITY Sorry,... . $ENTITY I suppose this was a waste of time for you.
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Don't worry about it,... I needed a break from my aimless wandering. $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY I wouldn't have known the first thing about fixing your lights.... !
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Oh, ... I forgot you were still here. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the excitement is over. $ENTITY You can head home. $ENTITY Maybe $ENTITY will give you something for the trouble. $ENTITY She's generous like that. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I'm taking off. $ENTITY See you guys later!
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Is that it? $ENTITY I thought there was going to be a real drama bomb when I showed up. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY that's my cue to leave. $ENTITY See you around $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY All right then. $ENTITY If that's it, $ENTITY I'm going to head home and practice $ENTITY . $ENTITY If either of you needs me again, $ENTITY you know where to find me. $ENTITY See ya!
