HA FreeG Host I saw someone I haven't met before walking around town. $ENTITY Do you have company here?
HA FreeG Host I saw someone new in town! $ENTITY Is the enemy finally attacking us?! $ENTITY Huh? You've got company here? $ENTITY Oh, come on! That's not nearly as fun as an enemy attack... .
HA FreeG Host $ENTITY You have company visiting, don't you?
HA FreeG Host $ENTITY 
HA FreeG Host $ENTITY I guess I should meet with your company later! What should I do if they ask me for an autograph?
HA FreeG Host $ENTITY Maybe... people in other towns are talking about my amazing $ENTITY skills?!
HA FreeG Host Well, I gotta chat with your company! $ENTITY What should I say if they ask if we're buds? $ENTITY I should say "great buds," right?
HA FreeG Host When you have friends visiting your town $ENTITY and you decide it's time to say good-bye... Press $ENTITY START $ENTITY , and then select $ENTITY End the multiplayer session... Once you tell everyone the party is over, they'll go home all at once! $ENTITY You can see off each of them at the station, $ENTITY but it can be convenient to end the party pronto, ... Just keep this little trick in mind in case you need it!
