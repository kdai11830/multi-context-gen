HA Re Q09 $ENTITY Hey, you! How dare you break your promise! $ENTITY We talked about you coming over to my house... I was really looking forward to it! $ENTITY If you do that again, I'm gonna make you run 100 laps around town!
HA Re Q09 I know I was the one who invited you to come over to my house, but I'm sorry... Something else came up... My apologies, ... I promise I'll make up for this some other time! Don't judge me!
HA Re Q09 $ENTITY ! There's something I need to apologize for! $ENTITY We were supposed to meet up, and I let you down. $ENTITY There was something else I needed to take care of... I'm really sorry! To make it up to you, I'm gonna run around town yelling " $ENTITY 's cool!"
HA Re Q09 Hey, $ENTITY ! How did you do that trick? $ENTITY Don't act like you don't remember! You suddenly disappeared $ENTITY when we were walking together! $ENTITY And then we couldn't hang out! $ENTITY It was a double whammy! I'm still in shock! $ENTITY !
