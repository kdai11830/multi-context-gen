AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Ahh, great weather this morning!... I wonder if it'll last until tonight. $ENTITY There's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight... I'm hoping we can see it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Hey, check it out! $ENTITY Not a cloud in the sky, right? $ENTITY They say days like this lead to clear nights, so maybe we'll see some shooting stars, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY 
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY But never mind that, ... Did you see... the rainbow? $ENTITY It's a present from the sun to apologize for all the rain, right? $ENTITY Yeah! It has to be! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY But, hey! $ENTITY Did you see the rainbow? $ENTITY Rainbows are so cool! $ENTITY I love 'em!
AN FreeB Weather Ahhhh... Man, it's cold! $ENTITY But I bet we can see that thing tonight! That thing! $ENTITY The aurora! $ENTITY The sky curtain! $ENTITY It's amazing when you really see it! $ENTITY I was so shocked my first time, I about fainted! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Hey, what do you think the aurora is made of? $ENTITY I think... it's the sun's smiling spirit! $ENTITY The sun's heart overflows, and its spirit floods the sky! $ENTITY !

AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY The other day I read this book called $ENTITY Storm Caller.... It was sooooo cool! I wonder if I have storm-calling superpowers? $ENTITY Course... we don't really need bad storms in this town, ...

AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Weather like this makes me think about when I was a kid! $ENTITY I guess it was... the spring when I was seven years old. $ENTITY It was the first time I concocted my special mix of $ENTITY and $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It was surprisingly good, and I felt one step closer to being an adult! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Weather like this makes me think of my childhood! $ENTITY I guess it was... the summer when I was seven years old! $ENTITY That was when I first heard ... And I instantly felt more grown up!
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Weather like this makes me think of when I was a kid! $ENTITY It must have been... the fall when I was seven years old! $ENTITY I went to see $ENTITY event and got myself some $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Since then, I've always enjoyed $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Weather like this makes me think of my childhood! $ENTITY It must have been... the winter when I was seven years old! $ENTITY I got my first taste of delicious $ENTITY back then, and it turned my world upside down!

AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Hey, nothin' to do with nothin' but... Hide-and-seek is way different on rainy days than sunny days, right? $ENTITY I mean the rain hides your smell, so it's easier to hide! $ENTITY On a sunny day like this, anyone with a good nose is gonna find you right away, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Cloudy days... smell like cloudy days. $ENTITY I know that sounds weird, but... it's like you can tell something's coming.... Maybe rain? $ENTITY Or snow? $ENTITY Who knows? $ENTITY Whatever it is, you can bet I'll be ready for it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Hey, nothin' to do with nothin' but... Hide-and-seek is way different on rainy days than sunny days, right? $ENTITY I mean the rain hides your smell, so it's easier to hide! $ENTITY On a rainy day like this, even finders with good noses will have trouble sniffing you out, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Snowy days have a particular smell. $ENTITY They just feel really pure, like they could hide the smelliest smell in the whole wide world! $ENTITY But it's still not OK to go around all stinky. You still need to take baths, OK? $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY ?
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Sunny days in spring have a unique, springy smell.... Do you think maybe it's all the cherry blossoms? $ENTITY That aroma gets me super excited!... My festival senses start getting all tingly, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Heh, the other day $ENTITY taught me a good trick. $ENTITY If you ever run out of stuff to talk about, just talk about the weather! $ENTITY 
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY I didn't expect to hear that kind of thing, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Oh! But I'm not saying we're out of stuff to talk about, OK? $ENTITY There's no way the two of us could ever run out of stuff to talk about!
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Yeah, talking about the weather probably won't ruffle anyone's feathers... So I guess that's a pretty good trick, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY When you're looking up at the sky... sometimes balloons just come flying outta nowhere, right? $ENTITY What I wanna know is... who the heck is sending 'em out? $ENTITY But I guess it's cool for a mystery to stay a mystery sometimes! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY I'm sure you already know this, but if you want to watch the meteor shower tonight, press up on . And when you see a shooting star... press to make a wish! $ENTITY I don't know if it's true or not, but I hear a present might come down to you if your wish reaches the star!
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Hey, we got important things to focus on tonight!... We're gonna see some shooting stars! $ENTITY You better have a wish ready! If you don't wish for anything, those stars are gonna be wasted, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Darn it! Whenever I see a shooting star, I get so flustered I can't get my wish out in time, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY I always end up holding my breath when I'm waiting for shooting stars. $ENTITY The stars must think I look silly! ... 
AN FreeB Weather $ENTITY Awwww! $ENTITY I was trying to look up at the sky without blinking, but my eyes get so tired! But if I close my eyes, I just know I'm gonna miss a shooting star!
