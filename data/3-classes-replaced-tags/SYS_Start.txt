SYS Start $ENTITY Good morning, Mayor $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Hello there, Mayor $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Good evening, Mayor $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Good morning, $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Well, hello there, $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Good evening, $ENTITY !
SYS Start In $ENTITY , it's , ... , $ENTITY , and the current time is ... Well then, shall we get started? $ENTITY Yes, let's. I need help first...
SYS Start At present, I can assist you with the following tasks:&#xF; $ENTITY Set the time. Move to another town. Demolish my home. Re-create the town. Never mind...
SYS Start At present, I can assist you with the following tasks: $ENTITY Set the time. Demolish my home. Re-create the town. Never mind...
SYS Start $ENTITY Well then, shall we get started? $ENTITY Let's begin! Something else...
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh my! Has my clock gotten out of whack? $ENTITY Then please tell me what the correct time is!
SYS Start So that's ... on ... , $ENTITY . Correct? $ENTITY Perfect. Nope.
SYS Start $ENTITY What?! Sorry, but my ears are just too fluffy and muffly, I guess. $ENTITY Please tell me once more.
SYS Start $ENTITY OK! That should do it! The time should now be correct.
SYS Start $ENTITY Wonderful. Let me get you set up. $ENTITY 
SYS Start For now, let's just put that notion on the back burner for a bit, OK? $ENTITY Boy, talk like that is likely to give me a panic attack. $ENTITY OK, enough of that. Shall we get you started? $ENTITY Yes, let's. I need help first...
SYS Start Also, please keep in mind that any items you have for sale in $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY will not move with you. Oh, and that applies to any items you have on exhibit on the second floor of the $ENTITY museum $ENTITY as well. ... After hearing that, $ENTITY do you still want to proceed with $ENTITY moving to a new town? $ENTITY Yes! Wait a minute!
SYS Start Also, if you have anything up for sale in $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY , it won't make the move with you. ... So $ENTITY do you still want to proceed with $ENTITY the move? $ENTITY Yes! Wait a minute!
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh my!... do you really mean to leave $ENTITY ?! ... We'll be so lonely without you, $ENTITY but I suppose your mind is made up. $ENTITY Before you move, there are a few things we need to go over so you understand how moving works. When you move, you can take your house, money, furniture, pockets, saved letters, and custom designs. However, items you're holding on to for other residents and items that aren't yours can't make the move. That goes double for letters still in your mailbox and letters you might be expecting.
SYS Start $ENTITY Then let me explain what you need to do in order to move. $ENTITY When moving to another town, in addition to the $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system $ENTITY you are using now... you'll need another $ENTITY Animal Crossing: New Leaf... Game Card $ENTITY inserted in another $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system $ENTITY . Choose $ENTITY Move In $ENTITY from the title screen of that other system. $ENTITY Then just follow the instructions on each game screen to complete the process. $ENTITY Now shall we get the process started? $ENTITY OK! No, thanks.
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Decided against moving after all?
SYS Start $ENTITY I wasn't able to find the other town. $ENTITY If you want me to try again, make sure the other system is ready. $ENTITY Shall I try again? $ENTITY One more time. Never mind.
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh!... So you don't want to move after all? $ENTITY Move. Don't move.
SYS Start $ENTITY I found a new town you can move to that's over on ... 's system! Shall we proceed with the move as planned? $ENTITY Move! I changed my mind.
SYS Start $ENTITY Thanks for waiting. I wish you nothing but the best, $ENTITY .
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh, is that all? Well, we'll just... $ENTITY Wait what?! $ENTITY But we can't destroy your house! We just can't! $ENTITY If you weren't here in $ENTITY , this whole place would fall apart! We can't run it without YOU! ... But if you really insist... you'll just have to choose $ENTITY Re-create the town $ENTITY !
SYS Start $ENTITY Oh, is that all? Well, we'll just...... Wait what?! $ENTITY Are you sure you really want to destroy your own house, $ENTITY ? If we did that, $ENTITY you'd lose all your records. $ENTITY Everything would be gone! $ENTITY Do you really want to do this? $ENTITY No, never mind. It's demolition time!
SYS Start Oh, thank goodness. $ENTITY What an absolute relief!
SYS Start $ENTITY It's done. $ENTITY I hope we meet again someday... somewhere!
SYS Start I understand. $ENTITY Then we'll just do away with your house...
SYS Start Your house is being destroyed. $ENTITY Do not touch .
SYS Start $ENTITY OK, it's gone now. $ENTITY Good-bye, $ENTITY .
SYS Start $ENTITY OK! The town will be...... Waitwhat?! $ENTITY 
SYS Start $ENTITY You... you can't be serious! $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY rebuild the town? That means $ENTITY will be TOTALLY gone. Is that what you really want? All the Bells you've earned... All your furniture... It will all be lost. $ENTITY And those who live in this town? ... G... E! $ENTITY Are you sure about this? This is absolutely, positively what you really, really want? $ENTITY On second thought... This is what I want.
SYS Start Oh, thank goodness! ... I'm glad you changed your mind!
SYS Start Understood. $ENTITY If you feel that strongly about it...
SYS Start The town is being erased. Do not touch .
SYS Start Oh, $ENTITY and I need to tell you... .
SYS Start OK, all set! $ENTITY .... AH! $ENTITY That reminds me! $ENTITY Mayor $ENTITY ? $ENTITY How's your work on raising your approval rating $ENTITY coming along? $ENTITY I can tell you the results of the latest surveys or how to improve your rating if you'd like. $ENTITY Feel free to visit the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY whenever you'd like! Just sit in the chair in the back to learn more!
SYS Start OK, all set! $ENTITY .... AH! $ENTITY That reminds me! $ENTITY Mayor $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I haven't had a chance to explain what your work as mayor entails, $ENTITY correct? $ENTITY When you find a moment, $ENTITY please come to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY and be sure to sit in the chair in the back!
SYS Start OK, $ENTITY all set! $ENTITY Have a nice day.
SYS Start All right, $ENTITY all set! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY but there is a... small problem. Last time you left without saving your game. $ENTITY So some of what you did last time may be gone. $ENTITY I'm very sorry. $ENTITY Please remember to $ENTITY save $ENTITY whenever you leave the game, $ENTITY OK?
