FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY An ogre?!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY An ogre?!
FU Ev Setsubun Be gone, $ENTITY ogre! $ENTITY Out with your bad luck, $ENTITY and in with good fortune!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Hee hee. $ENTITY Throwing my own beans really makes it feel like $ENTITY Bean Day... Thanks for helping, $ENTITY bad ogre!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY You can't have $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY without the beans! $ENTITY I didn't hit you in the eye or anything, did I?
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY It seems like a shame to throw out perfectly good beans.... Still, it's an important part of the tradition!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Wait... You're an ogre, $ENTITY but you're carrying beans. $ENTITY Do I still throw my beans at you? $ENTITY Are you carrying fake beans? $ENTITY I'm not sure how to proceed. $ENTITY 
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY What's this? $ENTITY You're an ogre, $ENTITY but you want to throw beans? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I suppose it is a lot of fun. $ENTITY I'm sorryI never realized ogres might enjoy it too!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY An ogre carrying beans?... I've never met an ogre who does that. $ENTITY You must be very avant-garde.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Today is $ENTITY Bean Day... so don't forget to stock up on beans! $ENTITY You'll need them in case you run into any ogres.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I've got a pocket full of beans in case I run into any ogres today!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Don't forget that today is $ENTITY Bean Day... If you don't throw any beans, you could have an unlucky year!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY It's nice that you have beans for throwing. $ENTITY I like to make a hearty soup with my leftover beans.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY a bean thrower! $ENTITY Thank you for helping to control the town's ogre population.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Are those beans for $ENTITY Bean Day... I'm glad you're participating in our traditions. $ENTITY You're a great sport!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Hooray for us, $ENTITY the bean-throwing squad! $ENTITY Let's do our best to banish bad luck and bring in good luck!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I see someone else has beans for $ENTITY Bean Day... It's up to us to make sure this town is lucky all year long.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Hello, $ENTITY fellow bean enthusiast! $ENTITY Are you ready to banish bad luck from our lovely town?
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Are you trying to escape having beans thrown at you? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I can't let you stay too long, $ENTITY but you can have some tea. $ENTITY Then you should leave town, please!
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY As a guest in my home, $ENTITY it would be rude to chase you out. $ENTITY We'll resume our bean-throwing tradition outside.
FU Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I suppose it wouldn't be $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY without you ogres. $ENTITY Rest here for a few minutes. $ENTITY Then it's back outside!
