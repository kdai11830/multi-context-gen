AN FreeA Always $ENTITY So listen to this! $ENTITY The other day I went to a spa with a friend from back home! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY You ever have those nights when you just can't sleep?... At times like that... you know what to do! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY This has nothing to do with anything, but... I love potatoes! $ENTITY I could eat 'em every day! $ENTITY How do you like your taters? $ENTITY Baked! Mashed! French fried! I can't decide! Potatoes are yucky!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY This is kinda out of the blue, but... do you ever do any cooking?... I sure do! All the time! None that ended well.
AN FreeA Always The other day... asked me for a secret meeting behind the town hall! $ENTITY #x0;.
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I just recently realized this, but... I kind of have a thing for telling fortunes and guessing the future. $ENTITY 678
AN FreeA Always : $ENTITY =
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I wanna talk to you, ... Do you think you can make it so you never lose a fight? $ENTITY 'Cause you can. $ENTITY Let me break it down for you... MN $ENTITY #x0;Q
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY I went back home the other day, and I found my diary from when I was a kid! $ENTITY It had a lot of real interesting stuff in it! $ENTITY I was kind of a strange kid... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Did you hear the news? $ENTITY If you want to enjoy $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY to the fullest, you gotta make sure to have a certain item or two ready! $ENTITY Your hint is... 1,031... If you feel up to it, look for headwear that costs $ENTITY 1,031 $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY in $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY 's shop!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY They had this pool with a table- tennis table floating in it! So we just had to try it out! $ENTITY It was crazy! $ENTITY Whoever came up with the idea of pool table-tennis is a total genius! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY It was like being on an overnight school field trip... We even had a knock-down, drag-out pillow fight! $ENTITY I don't think I've ever been in an organized pillow-fight tournament before. $ENTITY I didn't know they existed! $ENTITY But it was more fun than I thought!... You really should try it sometime! $ENTITY Start training now! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I've said it before,... but whoever thought of a hot tub is a genius! $ENTITY I love it, but... my noggin always gets cold when I'm tubbin'! $ENTITY Someone should invent a bubbly, warm-water hat you could wear while you're soaking! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY For dinner there was this serving tray as big as a coffee table... We got crazy excited when we saw it! $ENTITY A tray that big full of $ENTITY ? That'd be so cool to see! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY The owner of the place was a super-nice lady! $ENTITY I was really able to kick back and relax! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY A piping-hot bowl of oatmeal will get you snoozing! $ENTITY It's a perfect midnight snack! $ENTITY You get the oats all fluffy and hot... and put some milk in there too! $ENTITY It'll make your tummy all warm and toasty! $ENTITY And you'll sleep like a little oatmeal-loving baby! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY You need some sandwich magic!... Try whipping one up for a snack! $ENTITY I prefer to not put anything in it. $ENTITY I just butter the bread! $ENTITY Eat that, and you'll feel nice and full $ENTITY and sleep till morning!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Watch some late-night TV! $ENTITY It's terrible, and it'll put you right into a sleepy mood!... Just be careful not to catch that occasional good movie, or you'll get drawn in and stay up all night!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Deep breathing can really help.... Take a few deep breaths to calm down and get all sleepy, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Try a carrot as a midnight snack! $ENTITY Peel it real nice, and crunch it up nice and slow. Let the day's stress roll off as you crunch! $ENTITY It'll fill you up, and you'll sleep clean on till morning, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Yeah, I hear ya! $ENTITY And you gotta top it off with the ultimate dynamic duo of cheese and chives!... Yeah, I knew you'd be on Team Baked Potato with me!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh my gosh! They're so good that way! $ENTITY I like to do a little taterscaping and make a path for a gravy river!... Pour it on, and let that gravy river just gush over the gravyfall and flood the mashed-potato plains! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Boom! $ENTITY French fries! $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY I can really go to town on french fries. $ENTITY I pretty much inhale 'em! $ENTITY Ever tried 'em with a little sea salt and vinegar? Get that salty-tangy thing going? $ENTITY Yum-diddly-um, dude!
AN FreeA Always ... I know, right?! $ENTITY I feel like potatoes are the superheroes of food! $ENTITY They can do anything! $ENTITY They leap over fruit and fly faster than other vegetables! $ENTITY They can team up with sweet and spicy stuff!... And they can stand alone against the injustices of broccoli and cauliflower! $ENTITY I salute you, potatoes!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Th- $ENTITY that's ridiculous... How can you not like potatoes?! $ENTITY Have you ever even had a potato?!... Maaaan... If I were a wizard, I'd turn you into a giant potato!
AN FreeA Always "#
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I bet I could eat potatoes all day every day, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Ahh!... I want some potatoes right now! $ENTITY I'm going to go have some delivered! $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY It would be so cool to live in a big potato house! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Attaboy! $ENTITY Cooking takes more skill and strength than people think! $ENTITY Me... I always get called back home around the holidays to be the hero of feast preparation, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Ooh! $ENTITY Good for you! $ENTITY I always get called home around the holidays to help out with feast preparations. $ENTITY They all tease me about how girly I am in the kitchen... !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Huh! $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY Well, I guess that's pretty normal nowadays... Me, I get called home each year for the holidays to help out with the family feast! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY So you never... make your own home-cooked meals? $ENTITY But it's so good! And fun! $ENTITY And food tastes way better when you prepare it yourself! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY At first I thought maybe they were trying to pick a fight or something, so I had my guard up, but... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I thought they were gonna ask me to do some nutty favor for 'em, so I was all set to tell 'em to forget it!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I thought maybe they were gonna confess some secrets to me, so I was feeling kinda nauseous, but... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY 2
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY They just wanted to give me a gift from their recent trip! $ENTITY Kind of a weird place for that, $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY They just wanted to give my book back to me! $ENTITY That was a weird way to do that, though. $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY They just wanted to tell me about a new hole they dug! $ENTITY What a weirdo! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY I always look at the horoscopes in newspapers and magazines, $ENTITY and I've tried other methods too! $ENTITY Flower fortunes, star signs, weather fortunes, fish fortunes, $ENTITY gyroid fortunes... No matter which way I do it, the results are the same, so it's pretty believable!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY If the $ENTITY horoscope is bad in the morning, it ruins my whole day! $ENTITY That's why I only check it at the end of the day. $ENTITY That way if I mess something up, I can just blame it on luck! $ENTITY Pretty smart, huh? $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY The other day I spent hours looking for $ENTITY , since it's supposedly my lucky item! $ENTITY Of course... I'm not really sure what I'm meant to do with it now that I have it! ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY It would be fun to be a professional fortune-teller and read fortunes for other people! $ENTITY But how would I become a fortune- teller anyway? $ENTITY I wouldn't have to take some kind of crazy class or anything, would I? $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY The results of fortune telling are interesting, but... I think I'm more into the stuff they use! $ENTITY Crystals, cards, talismans, rubber duckies... It's all so mysterious! $ENTITY Whenever I pay for a fortune, I try to note what tools are being used! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY So the other day I went to a swap meet for $ENTITY stuff... Yeah, you really find out about your true nature at a place like that! $ENTITY The shoppers were like predators hunting down the best deals! ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY The other day I went to an international $ENTITY buffet with a friend! $ENTITY Man, $ENTITY your true nature really comes out in a place like that! $ENTITY You had to fake out all the other people to get to the best $ENTITY first! $ENTITY It was pretty thrilling actually! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY I was supposed to call my mom yesterday! $ENTITY Oh, man... I didn't answer her last letter, so I bet she's gonna be mad at me. $ENTITY It's nice that she cares about me, though! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , scary camp stories are a summer thing, right?... Do you have any good ones?... #x0;( $ENTITY Oh, yes. I'm too chicken. Well...
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY That's awesome! $ENTITY You sound like you've got a good one! $ENTITY Next time everyone's gathered somewhere, you should tell it! $ENTITY Don't tell me when we're alone! $ENTITY That's just asking for trouble! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Ahahaha! $ENTITY I know what you mean! $ENTITY I get waaaay too into scary stories, and then I get freaked out! $ENTITY If you told me a scary story right now, I probably wouldn't sleep for a week! ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Ah! Don't tell it now! $ENTITY Tell it when more people are around! $ENTITY There's safety in numbers, dude! I really can't handle ghosts and stuff... so I can't stand to hear scary stories when I'm by myself! $ENTITY Of course, if you did start telling it, I wouldn't be able to tear myself away! ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Scary stories have a strange effect on my body. In $ENTITY , they get my heart pounding and warm me up! $ENTITY But in summer they give me chills running down my spine, and that cools me down! $ENTITY It's weird! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Hey, so this has nothing to do with anything, but $ENTITY which vehicle gives you the least motion sickness?... #x0; $ENTITY Train. Boat. Both are bad.
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, yeah? $ENTITY You think a train rocks less than a boat?
AN FreeA Always Man, $ENTITY I get motion sickness while I'm walking sometimes... So I gotta be careful what I ride on! $ENTITY I really need to take my time when I'm planning a trip! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Really?... Yeah, $ENTITY I guess if the sea is calm it wouldn't rock that much... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Hahaha! $ENTITY You too, huh? $ENTITY Yeah, motion sickness is the worst $ENTITY especially on vacation trips! Then it gets all mixed up with homesickness! ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Have you heard about a connection between ears and motion sickness, ... They say people can get sick if their ears are too sensitive! $ENTITY #x0;
AN FreeA Always I've got pretty big ears... so I guess they're sensitive, ... 
AN FreeA Always ... I wonder if ear size has anything to do with it. $ENTITY Maybe folks with bigger ears are in a rough spot! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY As much as possible, don't fight fights you can't win! $ENTITY Pretty simple, don't you think? $ENTITY Of course if you're protecting someone, that's one thing... But otherwise, sometimes running is OK!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY As much as possible, don't fight unless you have to! $ENTITY It's that simple! $ENTITY Most encounters can be settled in the initial stare-down! $ENTITY Look your opponent right in the eye, and if you think you can't win... run!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Know when to let up! $ENTITY Once you've scared someone away, there's no need to chase 'em down! $ENTITY If you do, you're just a bully!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Don't break eye contact!... Stare 'em down, even when meeting someone for the first time! $ENTITY If you look someone right in the eye, you can tell if they're a threat... People who aren't serious threats will usually look away, so you can avoid a pointless dustup!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Don't show your trump card too early! $ENTITY It's tricky, but you can do it! $ENTITY If you've got, like, a water balloon up your sleeve, you'll feel at ease knowing you can use it whenever! $ENTITY Of course, you could just haul off and throw it at 'em at the get-go just to be safe, ... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY My dreams for the future seemed to change all the time! $ENTITY I was all over the place! $ENTITY For instance... V
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY On one page I wrote something like, "I'm gonna be $ENTITY maker and change the world!"... I don't really remember, but I guess I used to think that being ... maker was cool! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY On one page I wrote something like, "I want to win a big, important $ENTITY competition!" $ENTITY Can you imagine? $ENTITY I'm really more of a referee or coach type, not a serious athlete! $ENTITY What a crazy kid!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY On one page I wrote something like, "I'll plan to make the very best $ENTITY in the world!" $ENTITY What is that all about? $ENTITY I also wrote in there somewhere that I wanted to open a flower shop! $ENTITY I was so girly!
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY By the way, I'd be so embarrassed if anyone found that diary, $ENTITY so I just buried it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY Sometimes in the diary I referred to my mom as "Mama," which is weird because we never called her that!... We always called her "Mom." But maybe I secretly wanted to call her "Mama" sometimes... 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY When I was a kid, I'd go fishing and hunting for bugs every single day... I guess it's no different now! $ENTITY 
AN FreeA Always $ENTITY When I was a kid, I used to pick fruit and plant stuff all the time... which pretty much describes me now! $ENTITY
