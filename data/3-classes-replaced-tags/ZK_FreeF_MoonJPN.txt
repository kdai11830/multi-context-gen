ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY The moon is gonna be so beautiful tonight,... ! That's what I'd expect from a good $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Mmm, the dango rice cakes might even have a special taste as a result of the moon's power,... !
ZK FreeF MoonJPN It's a full moon tonight,... , seeing as how it's $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY and all. $ENTITY Everyone says the full moon is the prettiest moon of all... I think the moon on the wane is quite beautiful as well. $ENTITY Basically, in my eyes, $ENTITY the moon is beautiful no matter what it does... 
ZK FreeF MoonJPN I have a feeling $ENTITY something special will happen to me today! $ENTITY Do you know $ENTITY what's going to happen,... Yes? I don't know.
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY I knew you'd know!... Yup! $ENTITY Today is the day we get to see a full moon... , you're more of a lunar fan than I expected!
ZK FreeF MoonJPN All right, $ENTITY I'll give you a little hint then,... Today is the day where you can see a certain thing at its most prettiest point of the year! Got it? $ENTITY I'm not talking about a person, OK? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY other than myself, of course... $ENTITY Nope. For the answer, look up!
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY You ever look at the moon and just feel so small in comparison? $ENTITY It can get sort of overwhelming! $ENTITY Seeing it hanging up there, aloof and foreboding, $ENTITY it makes my heart beat faster and faster. $ENTITY It's kinda fun! $ENTITY Nights like this make me feel alive. $ENTITY Thank you, Mr. Moon! I'm so glad you're up there shining bright!

ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY Dango rice cakes and soba and udon... There are so many kinds of food to eat while watching the moon, don't you think,... But still, $ENTITY people seem to have a big appetite when they see a full moon like that! $ENTITY Can't they just be content to LOOK at all the delicious food? Why do they need to eat it all?
ZK FreeF MoonJPN A legend states that a bunny is pounding mochi in a bowl way up on the moon... But to me, $ENTITY it kinda looks like the profile of a woman,... says it looks like a crab... Perhaps we're just seeing what we want most from life when we look at the moon? $ENTITY So why a crab...?
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY The moon is beautiful today, $ENTITY don't you think, $ENTITY ?
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY The moon is pretty today!... Though it looks even better when I see it in your eyes... 
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY I feel like everyone stares at me during $ENTITY Tsukimi... #xE; $ENTITY even asked me why I'm not pounding mochi right now... Well, $ENTITY I don't really know why, $ENTITY but I guess I'd rather have people talking to me than ignoring me tonight.
ZK FreeF MoonJPN $ENTITY So $ENTITY why is the bunny going all the way to the moon to pound mochi anyway?... Hm. $ENTITY I should stop thinking about it! $ENTITY I mean, the bunny probably has his own reasons for doing that... It's not like there's a scientific reason, right?
