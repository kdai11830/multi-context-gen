HA 3P An $ENTITY Why do girls like cute things?
HA 3P An $ENTITY I don't especially like or dislike things that are supposedly cute. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY I hear some girls say "that's so cute!" or whatever, in a cutesy voice. $ENTITY But I don't buy it. $ENTITY They're trying to make themselves seem cute, and that's not my style! $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY The way you think is so cool! $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY Heh heh... Did you just say that $ENTITY I was "cool"? $ENTITY Guys who say "cool" are like girls who say "cute"! $ENTITY They're trying to make themselves seem cool!
HA 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Well, I never thought of it that way, but... Yeah, $ENTITY you might be right, $ENTITY .
HA 3P An $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY I like that you're being honest with yourself! ... Words can lose their power when they're overused, $ENTITY so watch it, OK?
HA 3P An $ENTITY Cool... I will no longer say "cool."
HA 3P An $ENTITY Yo, ... Perfect timing! $ENTITY Who's better at arm wrestling, me or $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Who do you think would have the upper hand?... . $ENTITY . It's a tie.
HA 3P An $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY I knew you'd pick me! $ENTITY I mean, I train every day. $ENTITY I wouldn't know how to lose, $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY You sure about that? $ENTITY Arm wrestling with a girl means holding her hand. $ENTITY To win, you'd have to squeeze those dainty fingers into oblivion!
HA 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY I couldn't do that! $ENTITY I'd rather lose than hurt a girl! $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY Ah ha ha! $ENTITY See? I've got you waving the white flag, and we haven't even started yet! $ENTITY You boys. $ENTITY You're so easy to deal with! $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You're saying $ENTITY could beat me?! $ENTITY Explain yourself, $ENTITY !
HA 3P An $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY A tie? Between $ENTITY and me?! $ENTITY You can't be serious! $ENTITY Why, ... Why would you say that?
HA 3P An $ENTITY Oh, come on! $ENTITY Don't be so annoying!... We put $ENTITY in a tough spot!
HA 3P An $ENTITY But I... I just can't accept this.
HA 3P An $ENTITY Oh, brother! $ENTITY Dude, if you're that upset about it, I'll arm wrestle you right now! $ENTITY Let's do it! $ENTITY 
HA 3P An $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY What a match!
HA 3P An $ENTITY Wait a second! $ENTITY You and I have opposite dominant hands. $ENTITY So $ENTITY our little match didn't really settle anything!
HA 3P An $ENTITY Ugh... After all that, $ENTITY I still can't tell if I'm stronger than you or not. $ENTITY 
HA 3P An $ENTITY Heya, ... So is $ENTITY here all glam rock all the time now? ... Or what?
HA 3P An $ENTITY I wanna do a punk song while all glammed up! $ENTITY I bet the contrast will blow your minds! $ENTITY So I'm gonna sing some questions, and you guys shout some answers. $ENTITY You got it, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY Here we go! $ENTITY Glam-rock guitar! $ENTITY Whockah whockah whaaaaaa! $ENTITY What makes your world go 'round?!... Sing it! $ENTITY Sing it! $ENTITY Sing it loooooooud!

HA 3P An $ENTITY Ugh... I guess I didn't understand what we were doing... .
HA 3P An $ENTITY You guys!... You do not rock!
HA 3P An $ENTITY What went wrong?
HA 3P An $ENTITY Rock is supposed to be spiritual! $ENTITY You guys don't understand anything! $ENTITY I am never going on tour with you!
HA 3P An $ENTITY Well, so much for hordes of screaming fans, $ENTITY .
