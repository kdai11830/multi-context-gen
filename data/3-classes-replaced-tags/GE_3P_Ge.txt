GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That would be SO awesome! $ENTITY Seasons are hard. $ENTITY The weather totally changes! $ENTITY It's confusing.
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY 
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That's why the readers out there need my help! $ENTITY Like, right now it's spring, so you should wear pastels. $ENTITY Cherry-blossom pink! Fresh-grass green! Sunshine yellow! Not-a- cloud-in-the-sky blue!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That's why the readers out there $ENTITY need my help! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY right now it's summer, $ENTITY so you should wear $ENTITY neon! $ENTITY Neon is hot $ENTITY AND cool, just like summer! Put a hot neon shirt in the fridge, and it'll turn icy cool!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That's why the readers out there need my help. $ENTITY Like, right now it's autumn. $ENTITY You should wear leaves! $ENTITY You heard me right $ENTITY leaves. $ENTITY Just glue a bunch on your skirt, $ENTITY and do some twirls! $ENTITY It's so $ENTITY back to nature!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That's why the readers out there need my help! $ENTITY Like, right now it's winter, so you should wear ice! $ENTITY And by "ice," $ENTITY I mean diamonds! $ENTITY You'll sparkle and shine $ENTITY just like a winter icicle.
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY That's the BEST fashion advice I've ever heard. $ENTITY I would totally put you on the cover of that mag!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY I've had, $ENTITY like, NO energy lately.
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Really?! That's totally not like you. $ENTITY What do you think is going on?
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY 
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Honestly, $ENTITY I think I just need to get more exercise. $ENTITY Do you know any good workout moves, ... Do a handstand. Learn to juggle. Jump a rope.
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Seriously?! $ENTITY Although, $ENTITY now that I think about it, $ENTITY doing a handstand sounds like a LOT of fun. $ENTITY Can you imagine me $ENTITY walking around town $ENTITY upside down on my hands? $ENTITY I bet I'd get a lot of $ENTITY funny looks!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Me?! Juggle? That's hilarious!... But now that I think about it, it COULD be a fun way to work out! $ENTITY Plus, it would be a great talent to put on my rsum. $ENTITY I could be a major juggling superstar!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Jump a rope?! $ENTITY So simple, and yet so totally brilliant. $ENTITY I can exercise AND have fun playing double Dutch! $ENTITY Of course, I'd have to find a good rope-jumping partner...
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY I know! $ENTITY Maybe I need to eat foods that are healthier. $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY the kinds that give you energy. $ENTITY Do you know any good foods like that, ... Pumpkin seeds. Blueberries. Dark chocolate.
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Really?! $ENTITY I had no idea that pumpkin seeds were, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY healthy. $ENTITY They're so deliciously crunchy! $ENTITY If eating pumpkin seeds all day $ENTITY makes me a health nut, $ENTITY then count me in, $ENTITY !
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Blueberries?! $ENTITY That's, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY the funniest thing I've ever heard. $ENTITY Those things are like $ENTITY CANDY! Wait a sec... You're not laughing. $ENTITY Does that mean blueberries really $ENTITY ARE healthy?! $ENTITY Imagine that!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY You just $ENTITY BLEW my mind! $ENTITY I've heard stories about chocolate being all healthy, $ENTITY but I just never believed it! $ENTITY This is, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY a total dream come true, $ENTITY !
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Wow! That's, like, an AWESOME suggestion. I'm gonna try that too!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Yeah, you always have the best advice. $ENTITY I'm gonna have $ENTITY TONS of energy now! Thanks a bunch!

GE 3P Ge $ENTITY The second I saw your outfit, I was all, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY "I have $ENTITY GOT to get myself an outfit just like that!"
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY I know! $ENTITY I saw this look on the cover of $ENTITY Today's Stylish ... and I just $ENTITY HAD to get it!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh my gosh! I totally read that issue. $ENTITY How did I not notice your outfit, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY right away?!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Hee hee! $ENTITY I guess I must wear it a lot better $ENTITY than the cover model!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Can you guess where I got $ENTITY MY new outfit from?

GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Ha ha ha! $ENTITY I totally WISH there was a catalog like that! $ENTITY I would buy all my outfits from it! Wait a sec... IS there a catalog like that?! $ENTITY I think someone's been using my name illegally!
GE 3P Ge $ENTITY Calm down! $ENTITY There's no catalog like that. $ENTITY Although I think we $ENTITY ALL agree there should be.
