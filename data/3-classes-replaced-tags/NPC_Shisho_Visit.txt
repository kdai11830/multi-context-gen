NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY hey, you. $ENTITY You're the $ENTITY mayor of this town, right?
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Sorry to drop by uninvited.... I came here today to ask a favor of you, $ENTITY . Mayor.
NPC Shisho Visit ... You see, $ENTITY I was wondering if you'd let me open up shop in the shopping district... . $ENTITY That's my request in a nutshell.... . ... #xE; $ENTITY Sounds great! What kind of shop? Permission denied!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY You mean it?! $ENTITY You didn't even ask me what KIND of place I'm planning on opening... Mayor, you've got the natural rhythm of a world-class comedian!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Still, I SHOULD explain what kind of establishment I plan to open... I want to bring $ENTITY entertainment to everyone in $ENTITY with a live venue: ... Club LOL... Hmmm. $ENTITY You don't seem as excited $ENTITY as I thought you'd be... But $ENTITY I'm not worried! $ENTITY Seeing how easygoing you are, $ENTITY . Mayor, I feel confident you'll love it! $ENTITY 
NPC Shisho Visit Anyway, $ENTITY Mayor, since you've agreed to my plan, I'll need a little more help $ENTITY to make it come true! ... Truth is, I actually went down to the town hall and talked with your secretary, $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , first. $ENTITY Live venues can be a little on the noisy side, and some people might complain about that... . $ENTITY She said if I want to open one, I'd need permission from the mayor and signatures from some residents. $ENTITY Since you've given me the green light, ALL that's left is to collect the signatures!
NPC Shisho Visit And I just happen to have...... That's right! $ENTITY A $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY !
NPC Shisho Visit ... So get out there $ENTITY and get me some signatures! $ENTITY I was waiting for a response there. $ENTITY Did you shout, $ENTITY "DO IT YOURSELF!" $ENTITY Maybe yes? $ENTITY No? ... I see. $ENTITY Regardless, $ENTITY I really want to ask for your help with this, $ENTITY . Mayor. $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY I think this would go a lot quicker $ENTITY if people were asked by someone familiar to them like you. It'd be weird if a stranger like me just started going up and saying, "HEY! Want a CLUB?!"
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY I've already talked with the other shop owners, so all I need are ... signatures from town residents!
NPC Shisho Visit I'm going to be preparing for the grand opening, so I'll probably be in the shopping district a lot... . $ENTITY If you collect all the signatures or just need to talk to me, $ENTITY check there first. Well, $ENTITY thanks for the help!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Ah, you'll need a $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY , won't you... It's just that I can't GIVE you one at the moment. $ENTITY I'll be preparing for the grand opening, so I'll probably be in the shopping district a lot... . $ENTITY When you get a chance, $ENTITY come to the shopping district to pick up the sheet from me. I'll be $ENTITY waiting for you!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Have I $ENTITY PIQUED your interest? $ENTITY Well, my plan is to $ENTITY bring some $ENTITY entertainment to everyone in $ENTITY with a live venue. I call it ... Club LOL... Hmmm. $ENTITY You don't seem nearly as excited $ENTITY as I thought you'd be... .
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Get your imagination going, and picture it in your head! $ENTITY Come on now! $ENTITY You're getting more and more EXCITED about it, right? $ENTITY It's a great idea! $ENTITY Yeah, sounds great! I'm not sure...
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Doesn't it?... I KNEW you'd feel that way!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY What? It's like you put a big ol' NO stamp on my bright-pink forehead! $ENTITY I can't believe you'd say no like that without even listening to what kind of place I want to open up. That's...just awful... .
NPC Shisho Visit Maybe a cool, reserved mayor like yourself will warm up to my idea after you've heard it? $ENTITY After all, my plan is to... bring $ENTITY entertainment to everyone in $ENTITY with a live venue: ... Club LOL... HA! And the crowd cheers!... Why do I feel like I'm still getting $ENTITY the cold shoulder... .
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY You've GOT to be kidding me!... I thought you'd love it for sure... Man, what am I going to do now... I can't open up the place without permission from the mayor... .
NPC Shisho Visit Well, $ENTITY this isn't enough to break my spirits! Nope, not this ex-comedian! $ENTITY I just gotta believe that someday you'll come around and understand what I'm trying to do for everyone! $ENTITY So I think for now I'll head to the shopping district to look for a good spot to eventually open shop... . $ENTITY If you change your mind and decide to give me the OK, come find me in the shopping district. I hope $ENTITY to be seeing you in the near future, $ENTITY . Mayor!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Thanks for gathering signatures! $ENTITY The fate of $ENTITY Club LOL $ENTITY is in your generous hands! $ENTITY I'll be in the shopping district for a while, so just bring the signatures there after you've collected them!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY I'm counting on you to get all the signatures for me! $ENTITY I plan on bumming around over in the shopping district, so stop by to get the $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY later.
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY I'm counting on you to get signatures for me!... Oh! $ENTITY It looks like I can give you the sheet right NOW.... Let me dig it out for you!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY That's the $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY , so take it around to people in town and see if they'll sign it. $ENTITY I've already asked the shop owners in the shopping district, so we just need signatures from $ENTITY 6 $ENTITY residents!
NPC Shisho Visit I believe that SOMEDAY you'll change your mind and agree to let me open up a live venue! $ENTITY I plan on sticking around the shopping district for a while. $ENTITY Come find me there when you DO eventually change your mind!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY I'm counting on you to get those signatures for me! $ENTITY I plan on sticking around here for a while, so come by to get the $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY at some point.

NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Hey, ... Did you change your mind? $ENTITY Do I have your permission $ENTITY to open a live venue in ... Go for it! Permission denied!
NPC Shisho Visit ... Aw, man... . $ENTITY But I WON'T give up until you change your mind! Someday!
NPC Shisho Visit .... HO! ... I just knew it!... I knew you'd see things MY way eventually!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Ah, you'll need a $ENTITY #x0;signature sheet $ENTITY , won't you... Oh, it doesn't seem like I can give you one at the moment. $ENTITY I'm going to be preparing for the grand opening, so I'll probably be here a lot... . $ENTITY When you get a chance, $ENTITY come by to pick up the sheet from me. $ENTITY I'll be $ENTITY waiting!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY how goes the signature collecting? You working hard? $ENTITY I got them all! It's coming along.
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Great! Keep it up!... After all, the fate of $ENTITY Club LOL... is in your hands, $ENTITY . Mayor!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY REALLY?!... Then can you give me the $ENTITY signature sheet $ENTITY ?
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Huh? Is something wrong? $ENTITY Hmmmm... Well, $ENTITY all I can say is $ENTITY keep at the signature collecting until you have them all!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Huh... This is still blank!... Geesh! I'm counting on you! Don't let me down now!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You don't have quite enough signatures yet... I won't be able to get permission to open the place without ... signatures, $ENTITY so keep that in mind. And thanks!
NPC Shisho Visit $ENTITY Whoa! You got them ALL for me!... Awesome! $ENTITY I'll take this and get everything going right away!
NPC Shisho Visit As long as I can get the permit I need, all that's left is to do the necessary construction! $ENTITY I'm not exactly sure when I'll be able to open to the public, though... I'll do my best to hurry. $ENTITY I plan on opening my place in the basement here. Feel free to stop by anytime and see how it's going! OH! Before I forget... Thank you very much!
