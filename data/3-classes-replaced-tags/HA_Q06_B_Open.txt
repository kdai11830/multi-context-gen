HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh!... Wow. $ENTITY A present from ... Well, all right then!
HA Q06 B_Open Oh... It's from ... Am I still upset about our fight... Ha ha! $ENTITY Totally over it, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;. $ENTITY 
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? $ENTITY No way! $ENTITY I let $ENTITY borrow my $ENTITY about a million years ago!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What's this all about? $ENTITY Is this my $ENTITY ? It looks familiar... Oh! $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY Heh. $ENTITY I forgot that I loan things to $ENTITY sometimes! $ENTITY 
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? $ENTITY My package ended up at $ENTITY 's place? $ENTITY I mean... $ENTITY This is a gift for...... Why is it totally unwrapped? $ENTITY Yeah, about that... Interesting.
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY I already have the gift I ordered for ... So what is this then? More importantly... why is it open?! $ENTITY Yeah, about that... Interesting.
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Hey, thanks for taking the time to make the delivery, $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Thanks for making the delivery! $ENTITY Because of you, maybe $ENTITY and I will be OK. $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I guess it is what it is... 
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Unwrapping a present that doesn't belong to you is soooo uncool! $ENTITY About that... Yeah!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY But stuff like that doesn't usually bother me, I guess.... Thanks for going out of your way to make the delivery!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY What matters is what's on the inside! $ENTITY Thanks for the delivery, $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You opened it?! $ENTITY You broke a sacred trust, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;! $ENTITY "Guard stuff that's in your care." $ENTITY That's what Grandpa used to say! $ENTITY Man... Normally we might be boxing right about now, $ENTITY but I'll let it slide since you came clean, $ENTITY .
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY You'll guard any future packages with your life, right?
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I suppose you did go out of your way to make the delivery. $ENTITY So I think you deserve some kind of reward... 
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY But think about what you've done! $ENTITY If it happens again... you're giving me one million jumping jacks!
HA Q06 B_Open Wait. $ENTITY This was given to you all unwrapped like this? $ENTITY Hmmm... You know, it doesn't really bug me, ... I know! $ENTITY I'm surprised too! $ENTITY Anyway, thanks for the delivery, $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open Thanks for braving the great outdoors to make the delivery!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I never thought I'd see this again! $ENTITY Thank you, $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open Actually... I already bought a replacement for that.
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY You just can't trust anyone these days! $ENTITY Also, forget I said anything about a "gift."
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY You did this?!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh, man! $ENTITY This was going to be the perfect surprise! $ENTITY This is awkward.... This is actually a present for you. $ENTITY It's complicated. $ENTITY Just take it! It's $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open Things didn't go the way I planned, but at least you're still surprised!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY You're a good pal, $ENTITY , but that doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want! $ENTITY !
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY You don't open a present that isn't yours... even if it $ENTITY might $ENTITY be yours! That's just how it works!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I'm going to go ahead and call this an accident... But don't let it happen again!
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Well, you were honest with me, $ENTITY so I won't turn you into a pretzel... 
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY If you do pull a stunt like this again, I'll make you do 10,000 push-ups... with $ENTITY on your back!
HA Q06 B_Open I do think you probably deserve a reward for making the delivery.
HA Q06 B_Open $ENTITY It's ... This time is a special case, got it? $ENTITY Do it again, and I'll make you do a million push-ups with $ENTITY on your back!
