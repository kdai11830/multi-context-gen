GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY WHO ARE YOU $ENTITY AND WHY DO YOU LOOK $ENTITY EXACTLY LIKE ME?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY What are you talking about?! $ENTITY It's totally obvious that, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY YOU'RE the impostor!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY That's a bold-faced lie! I swear I'm the $ENTITY real me!... What should I do? $ENTITY There's a fake ME!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY As IF! $ENTITY Stop trying to trick poor... . $ENTITY You totally know the real me is, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY ME!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You need to $ENTITY STOP pretending you're me. $ENTITY This town $ENTITY can't handle more than one $ENTITY 
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY YOU knock it off! $ENTITY I know you must be a devoted groupie of mine or something, $ENTITY but this is going too far!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Impostor! $ENTITY Mean, $ENTITY icky, $ENTITY rude, $ENTITY not-nice $ENTITY IMPOSTOR!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You can't sway me! $ENTITY I know I'm the real one!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You really need to cut it out. $ENTITY It's, like, $ENTITY totally obvious I'm the real $ENTITY .
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY It's not THAT obvious. $ENTITY Especially since I'M the real one. $ENTITY How long can you keep up this charade?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY This is getting ridiculous.... I've got an idea! $ENTITY Think you can figure out which one is the impostor, ... Absolutely! Uh...
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Awesome! $ENTITY OK then, just give this washcloth to the one you think is the impostor. $ENTITY Once she wipes her face with it, we'll be able to tell who she $ENTITY really is!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I'm so glad we have you to help us figure this out, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY No pressure or anything, $ENTITY but I am $ENTITY TOTALLY counting on you!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Are you kidding me?
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You seriously don't know who is who? UGH!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY This is, $ENTITY like, totally ridiculous. $ENTITY Can't you do anything, ... Calm down, everyone! This'll work itself out.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I will NOT calm down!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Yeah! How can we calm down at a time like this?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P In what world could this possibly work itself out?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY This won't just go away! $ENTITY Unless, $ENTITY of course, $ENTITY that $ENTITY IMPOSTOR just goes away!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I think you can help us out, but you'd need to open up some space in your pockets first!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You can tell which one of us is the impostor, can't you, ... Sure can! Um...
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Sweet! $ENTITY And you've already got a washcloth, so just give that to whoever you think is the impostor. $ENTITY Once she wipes her face with it, we can see who's who around here!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Thanks for your help!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I'm, like, totally counting on you.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Are you KIDDING me?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY What are we gonna do now?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You think I'M the impostor?! $ENTITY There's only one thing that'll change your mind. $ENTITY Gimme that washcloth!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Watch carefully! $ENTITY I'm...
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I guess this is harder for you than I thought it would be!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Uh... I think that washcloth is the only thing that could help us settle this $ENTITY little issue.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I knew it! $ENTITY Thank the stars that $ENTITY was here to help out!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Sheesh! $ENTITY What a troublemaker! $ENTITY But you really saved the day. $ENTITY And you totally knew $ENTITY I was ME! $ENTITY Now I know you actually listen to me when I talk! $ENTITY I'll give you this $ENTITY picture $ENTITY of me $ENTITY as a special thanks.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You're, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY my HERO! $ENTITY So feast your eyes on that gorgeous $ENTITY picture $ENTITY , and think of me fondly, $ENTITY . Wait a sec... Is that troublemaker heading off to someone else's home now? $ENTITY You need to go help them!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You're, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY my HERO! $ENTITY So every time you look at that $ENTITY picture $ENTITY , it'll be like I'm right there with you! Hmm... I think that troublemaker $ENTITY plans to come back next year. $ENTITY Or maybe that's just another lie!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Thanks for everything! $ENTITY And next time you need me, $ENTITY just stare really hard at that $ENTITY picture $ENTITY , $ENTITY OK? $ENTITY I doubt anything'll happen, $ENTITY but it will make me feel good knowing someone is looking at me. $ENTITY Everyone in town owes you one. $ENTITY You helped us $ENTITY ALL out today, $ENTITY or so I heard from $ENTITY Blanca $ENTITY . Nice job!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY See? $ENTITY I'm not the impostor! $ENTITY I'm the real one!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Can't you see that $ENTITY aura practically $ENTITY OOZING out of me?
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY But I'll drop that for now, 'cause there's more important stuff to worry about! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY who $ENTITY WAS that troublemaker? $ENTITY I hope our paths don't cross again. $ENTITY And in the meantime, ... I want $ENTITY YOU to start learning more about me! $ENTITY Maybe it'll come in handy someday.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY But I'll drop that for now, 'cause there's more important stuff to worry about! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY who WAS that?! $ENTITY That troublemaker is probably gonna cause, you know, trouble for someone else in town. If that happens, $ENTITY you've GOT to help them out, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Wait up! Where are you going?!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Are you really gonna abandon me right when I need you the most?
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You're back! $ENTITY Good! All you have to do $ENTITY is hand over that washcloth to the one you think is the impostor.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Which is, $ENTITY of course, $ENTITY totally not me.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I was born on ... ! $ENTITY That makes me the real $ENTITY 
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You've got it all wrong! $ENTITY I was actually born on ... I'm the one and only $ENTITY 
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Well, anyone who knows me knows my favorite saying! $ENTITY It's...
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I have that saying, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY burned into my brain! $ENTITY That means I've $ENTITY GOT to be the real $ENTITY 
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I don't know what you have burned into your brain, $ENTITY but it sure isn't my favorite saying. $ENTITY That's 'cause it's...
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P There should be NO doubt in anyone's mind now!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I bet you don't know what I'm really good at!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Sure I do! $ENTITY ! And I know I'm good at it $ENTITY because I'm the real $ENTITY 
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY GOTCHA! $ENTITY You just proved you're the impostor. $ENTITY The correct answer is $ENTITY !
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY You don't know $ENTITY what you're talking about.
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY OK, the gloves are coming off now. $ENTITY Let's take a look at the $ENTITY family tree!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Let's go ahead and do that then. $ENTITY Since I'm... , $ENTITY I know I'm $ENTITY .
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY is she now? $ENTITY I think, my dear, $ENTITY you are sorely mistaken! $ENTITY I guess you didn't do your homework! $ENTITY But I know for a fact that the real $ENTITY is, in all actuality, ... !
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I didn't need to do any homework, $ENTITY because I know all about MY family! $ENTITY You're the sorely mistaken one!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY I guess it all comes down to this. $ENTITY Only the true $ENTITY would know her secret dream... $ENTITY And since I'm the real ... I know I want to become ... ! $ENTITY So there!
GE Ev Aprilfool_3P $ENTITY That's ridiculous! Why would I ever want to do THAT? $ENTITY My real dream is to be $ENTITY . $ENTITY You shouldn't tell such lies, you know. $ENTITY It'll give you wrinkles!
