AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I've camped in lots of different places, but $ENTITY sure has a comfortable vibe. $ENTITY Is that why you're here? $ENTITY Yeah, you and me should hang out and have fun before it's time to part ways, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Living in a tent really makes you feel like you're on an adventure! $ENTITY You know what I mean? $ENTITY Course, the train is never too far away, so it's not like I'm way out in the wild.
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I came here 'cause I heard the $ENTITY air is especially sweet. The rumors were true!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I've camped all over the place, and sometimes I get to thinking about this crazy journey we're on. $ENTITY Dude, listen to me getting all deep and philosophical at some stranger! $ENTITY 
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Since I've been camping here, some of the $ENTITY folks have been checking in on me. $ENTITY Seems like there's a lot of good people here... You're visiting here too. So you know what I mean, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY You're from this town, aren't you? $ENTITY You must be $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Nice to meet ya! $ENTITY I'm ... I heard this town had good camping, so here I am! $ENTITY It's even nicer than I heard it was!... I think I'm gonna enjoy a bit of tent living, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Oh, hi! $ENTITY Are you from this town? $ENTITY I'm just visiting this lovely place! $ENTITY Heh! Might as well tell you my name! $ENTITY I'm ... And you're... ? Nice to meet you! $ENTITY I basically picked $ENTITY out of a hat when I was looking for a place to camp. $ENTITY But it worked out great! $ENTITY I'll have to remember this place! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Oh, you're from right around here in $ENTITY , right?! $ENTITY Nice to meet ya!... My name is ... I've been traveling around to a bunch of different towns. $ENTITY You're, uh... right?... Glad you stopped by! $ENTITY This is a good camping spot. Lots of nice visitors!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Now that I'm gonna live here, I need to build a house! $ENTITY That's gonna be my focus for a while, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Now that I've decided to move, I'm getting excited! Things are about to get nuts! ... 
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY If I'm gonna move here, I should start schmoozing with folks in town and turn on the $ENTITY charm!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY told me I should move here, so I'm gonna do it! $ENTITY I have a few things to sort out, but I'll be living here before you know it! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Oh yeah! I should let you know... I'm moving here! $ENTITY I let $ENTITY talk me into it! $ENTITY I'll be seeing you around!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY So, uh, my homie $ENTITY talked me into moving into this town. $ENTITY Can't wait to get settled! $ENTITY Camping here really made me appreciate this town. So I'll be seeing you around, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent ... I wonder who came up with that name? It's bold and fresh, and I like it! ... 
AN Sp Camp_Tent When you sleep in a tent, you tend to get woken up by the sun shining in your face. $ENTITY Course, I've learned how to sleep right through it, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent I heard someone from this town say, $ENTITY "Camping means marshmallows!" $ENTITY I agree with that, but now all I can think about is the next marshmallow I'm gonna roast! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY So when you're in a tent, you're still pretty much outside, right? $ENTITY You hear lots of different sounds! $ENTITY The rushing river... The chirping bugs... Even I find it refreshing somehow! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I've slept outside before, but having a tent is completely different! $ENTITY It was heavy, but I'm glad I brought it with me, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Since I've been camping here, I've been feeling really great! I think this town really suits me! $ENTITY Maybe I should just move here. $ENTITY Yeah, do it! Don't be too hasty!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY This town has a lot of great folks in it! I bet it would be fun to live here! $ENTITY Think I should move in? $ENTITY Yeah, move here! Don't do it!
AN Sp Camp_Tent ... Just saying the name gives me a thrill. $ENTITY What do you think? Should I move here? $ENTITY Yeah, move here! Don't be too hasty!
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Naw, man! Just kidding! $ENTITY I mean, I'm here as a tourist, so I only see the surface of things. $ENTITY I'd need to see what happens behind the scenes before I could live here. $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY Really?!... Hmmm... You probably have the right idea. $ENTITY I guess you only see the bright side of $ENTITY when you're camping. $ENTITY .
AN Sp Camp_Tent $ENTITY I was only joking! I'd have to figure out the internal power structure before I could move here.... I need to know if I can be myself here... Ultimately that's what's most important, $ENTITY !
