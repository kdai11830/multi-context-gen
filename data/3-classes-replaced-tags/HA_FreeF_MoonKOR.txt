HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY today! It's a super-big deal here! $ENTITY The party starts once the moon comes out! $ENTITY I'm so excited about it!... !
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY I know you have an $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY celebration in your town, but do you know about $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY ? $ENTITY It's a lot bigger than your moon celebration. And we eat a type of rice cake called $ENTITY songpyeon $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'm out to set a new record for power eating the stuff! $ENTITY .
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY Are you staying here until tonight?... Please check out the full moon in our town if you have the time! $ENTITY Moon watching is always more fun when there are more people around,... !
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY I wonder how far we are from the moon... I bet I could run there, no problem! $ENTITY !
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY Stop it already and just show your true self! Coming to our town on a full-moon night... You're actually an alien from the moon, aren't you?! $ENTITY Yup! Nope!
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY You can't talk about $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY without mentioning $ENTITY songpyeon $ENTITY , a very delicious rice cake! $ENTITY Hmmm... I wonder how many carbs those things have... 
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY We're having an event called $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY here in $ENTITY tonight! $ENTITY We all watch the moon and eat lots of delicious food! $ENTITY And then we all run to the moon! $ENTITY Well, the "run to the moon" part is really just a wish of mine! $ENTITY Ha ha!
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY Which one's prettier, the moon in your town or the moon here in ... ! My town! They're the same...
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY Whoa! I knew it! I knew you came from the moon! $ENTITY Wait a minute? How are you going to get back home? $ENTITY Man, now I'm starting to feel sorry for you... .
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY A- $ENTITY are you sure? $ENTITY How do I know I can trust you, $ENTITY #x10; $ENTITY #x0;ien $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0;ien $ENTITY #x0;o?
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY Heh heh! I'm proud of my town! I guess this is the best spot to observe the moon as well, huh? $ENTITY 
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY What?! Are you serious?! $ENTITY All right... If I get the chance to visit your town, I'll be sure to check out your moon! $ENTITY !
HA FreeF MoonKOR $ENTITY They're the same? $ENTITY Well, yeah, I get that, but... There must be some differences, like the scenery or the feelings you get when you look up at the moon! $ENTITY I guess it takes a really mature person to notice those kinds of things, $ENTITY !
