FU 3P Ge $ENTITY You always seem so self-confident.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You think?... That's awesome! $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY a superstar shouldn't try to escape the spotlight, ya know!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I wish I had more confidence when it comes to wearing new outfits.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Yeah?! $ENTITY Are you saying you wanna be more like me,... ?!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY W- $ENTITY wait, $ENTITY that's not what I meant! $ENTITY I just wish I had more confidence!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Don't be so nervous, $ENTITY girl!... When I'm done with you, $ENTITY you're gonna walk and talk just like me! OK, $ENTITY first lesson: $ENTITY You need to tell yourself $ENTITY "I'm totally amazing" 10 times a day.... But no more than 10. $ENTITY You don't want to overdo it, $ENTITY rookie. $ENTITY Ready? $ENTITY Say it for me!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I'm, $ENTITY uh, $ENTITY totally amazing? $ENTITY That's a little embarrassing to say out loud.... Don't you think so,... Maybe a little... But you are amazing!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY See? $ENTITY I'm glad you agree with me.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I guess so. $ENTITY I've never had a problem with it, $ENTITY but then again, $ENTITY I AM totally amazing!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh... You really think so? $ENTITY You're not just saying that to be nice?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Of course he's not! $ENTITY But don't go forgetting about me here. $ENTITY I'm the one who taught you to, $ENTITY like, BE totally amazing!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh... You really think so? $ENTITY You're not just saying that to be nice?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Of course she's not! $ENTITY But don't go forgetting about me here. $ENTITY I'm the one who taught you to, $ENTITY like, BE totally amazing!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I just finished the best book $ENTITY called ... You have to read it!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Hmm... It sounds long and boring.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh. $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY What about this one called $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I dunno. $ENTITY Don't you read any books about fashion or makeup? $ENTITY Or epic romance?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY but I don't buy a lot of books about stuff like that. $ENTITY But wouldn't it be good to expand your own horizons a little? $ENTITY Read a book about something new?
FU 3P Ge ... Why? $ENTITY I don't see you reading any of my magazines.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY I have the perfect book for you. $ENTITY It's a new best seller called $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Enough already! $ENTITY Look, $ENTITY maybe I'll borrow it someday. $ENTITY No promises. $ENTITY I have a lot of other stuff to, $ENTITY y'know, $ENTITY read.

FU 3P Ge ! $ENTITY #x0;
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Great! $ENTITY I've been thinking about experimenting with some new flavors, $ENTITY but I need inspiration. $ENTITY What's a good way to marinate figs that complements their sweetness? $ENTITY And do you know any good fusion dishes that use piment d'espelette?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Wait... .
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I think I'll do a twist on classic bucatini all'amatriciana. $ENTITY What do you think?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Great! $ENTITY I've been thinking about a few twists on classic recipes, $ENTITY but I need a second opinion. $ENTITY When you make mashed potatoes, $ENTITY do you use buttermilk or cream? $ENTITY And do you saut turnip greens or steam them for a few minutes? $ENTITY With or without paprika?
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Uh... .
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY And you've just got to share any tips you have for cheddar-apple pie.

FU 3P Ge $ENTITY But I don't $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY And apricot macaroons!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY /
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY But I can't make any of that stuff! $ENTITY The only fancy thing I can make is spinach lasagna!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY spinach lasagna isn't that easy. $ENTITY It's, $ENTITY um, $ENTITY a lot of spinach to wash.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY But I'm not good at making any of that stuff! $ENTITY The only thing I'm good at making is baked potatoes!
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY making baked potatoes isn't easy. $ENTITY Sometimes, $ENTITY um, $ENTITY sometimes $ENTITY they explode in the oven.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY I don't even know what most of those are! $ENTITY SNIFF. The only thing I'm good at baking is premade cookie dough.
FU 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY baking cookies from premade dough takes skill!... You have to keep checking to avoid burning them.
