NPC Reset Greet Hey, 'scuze me!
NPC Reset Greet How do ya do,... . Mayor!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Now don't worry, $ENTITY I'm not here $ENTITY to read ya the riot act about not saving. Yer off the hook today! Naw, I'm here to thank ya!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Now don't ya worry. $ENTITY I know ya made sure to save last time,... so I ain't here to chew ya out. Naw, I'm here to thank ya!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Ahem. $ENTITY For bein' so gracious as to establish the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY ... $ENTITY allow me to extend ya my most heartfelt thanks! So thanks! $ENTITY With this I can finally get back to monitorin' reset behavior in town!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY I guess this means $ENTITY ya see how important it is for me to keep chewin' ya out when ya reset!... That's how I'm takin' it anyway... . $ENTITY Well, don't worry! $ENTITY Next time I'll give ya the verbal lashin' of a lifetime! $ENTITY Oh yeah. Just one last thing... $ENTITY I know yer the mayor, $ENTITY but the center is off limits, even to you! Them's the breaks!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Resetti out!... 
NPC Reset Greet Well, look who it is!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Relax, kid.... I ain't here to read ya the riot act for not savin' last time.
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Relax, kid. $ENTITY I know ya saved yer game properly last time.... I ain't here to chew ya out or nothin'!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY I'm here to let ya know the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY is open! $ENTITY Since this town's been so gracious as to restore the center... $ENTITY I'm guessing the mayor of this town... wants me to put those no-good resetters in their place! Yeah! $ENTITY That's what I think anyway.... So next time ya "forget" to reset, $ENTITY I'll be bringin' the thunder! BOOM!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Oh, and by the way, $ENTITY the center's off limits to the public, $ENTITY so that means you! Sorry, kid!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY RESETTI OUT!... 
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Ahem. $ENTITY On the occasion of the establishment of the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY ... I suppose it's only fittin' that I properly introduce myself... The name's $ENTITY Resetti... But everyone calls me $ENTITY Mr. Resetti $ENTITY , on account of me bein'... such an esteemed community member! $ENTITY Pleased to meet ya!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Now lemme ask ya somethin'. $ENTITY Ya ever seen a message like this?... When you want to finish playing, press $ENTITY START $ENTITY and select $ENTITY Save and quit... The idea bein' that you should save so there's a record of all the progress you made in a day. $ENTITY Course, every once in a while, ya get some real funny jokers. $ENTITY Entitled little good-fer-nothin's who think if somethin' don't go their way, they can cut the power! $ENTITY "It's fine! $ENTITY I'll just reset and try again!"... I guess that's the idea. $ENTITY And, $ENTITY yeah, $ENTITY I guess that IS one way to play. $ENTITY One WRONG way! $ENTITY But doing everythin' ya can to avoid resettin'... is the officially endorsed play style of Animal Crossing!... Takin' everythin' as it comes and rollin' with the punches has its rewards! $ENTITY That's our stance... . $ENTITY Which is where the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY comes in. $ENTITY You know it's important 'cause it's all highlighted blue and everything. $ENTITY So 24 hours a day, 7 days a week we're monitoring all players... And when a reset occurs, $ENTITY yours truly rushes to the scene... to read 'em the riot... Er, that is to say,... to IMPRESS upon the player the importance of saving his or her progress. $ENTITY Now I know there'll be those times. $ENTITY "My batteries ran out!" $ENTITY "I didn't do it on purpose!" $ENTITY "It was an accident!"... I get that; don't worry. $ENTITY Anyway, alls I wanted to do was say hello, and I ended up putting on a one-mole show! $ENTITY Time I was goin'!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY Oh, and by the way, $ENTITY the center is off limits to the public. $ENTITY That means you. Sorry 'bout that, kid!
NPC Reset Greet $ENTITY RESETTI OUT!...
