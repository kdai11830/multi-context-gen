ZK FreeC Furniture_An So $ENTITY uses a double bed... Judging from her behavior, $ENTITY I'd say she needs it because she tosses and turns a lot. I toss and turn a lot too, $ENTITY but only because it helps me get exercise when sleeping!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY lives on her own, right?... So how come she has that ... ? Ahh, $ENTITY I see... Normal people have couches that seat more than one. Right, I get it now...

ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY The $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's house, huh... There might be some avant-garde clothing inside, or maybe just a shirt or something,... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 's clothes for special occasions?... Well, I give her fashion sense a pass for now! $ENTITY Heh heh heh... Did I just sound like a famous fashion designer? $ENTITY #x4;Gracie $ENTITY , $ENTITY eat your heart out!

ZK FreeC Furniture_An Earlier $ENTITY I discovered a book called $ENTITY on the ... . $ENTITY I'd never have guessed, but it looks like $ENTITY is into more advanced reading... I used to be a speed-reader, by the way. Had the highest reading speed back in $ENTITY school. Problem was that I read so fast $ENTITY I couldn't remember anything I read.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Oh,... made some tea for us,... I thought she wasn't into that sort of thing, $ENTITY but I guess I had her all wrong!... !

ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY I wonder if ... knows how to actually use the ... I worry she'll end up breaking it... In fact, $ENTITY it may already be broken! $ENTITY Hah ha! $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Ahh,... Definitely my favorite type of flower, $ENTITY even more than the others... I wonder if $ENTITY decorated the house just for me. $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I guess she knew I'd be visiting today,... !
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Ah ha! $ENTITY 's $ENTITY but at the same time I'm kinda curious!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY apparently has $ENTITY Huh. I wouldn't expect her to use that. I mean, she probably has better things to do.

ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY this is interesting! $ENTITY There's a cute $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's room... I guess she puts on a tough attitude, but she's not without her softer, gentler side. $ENTITY Like me,... !

ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An ... I didn't know $ENTITY knew the stork! $ENTITY I mean, I'm sure he's busy, but I wish he'd stop by and see me instead.... Hah ha!

ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY That's quite surprising! $ENTITY I didn't expect to see a girly item like that ... I guess $ENTITY isn't so opposed to the charm of a good, fruity piece of furniture. $ENTITY Maybe this means she's been taking my decorating advice?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An Ah, $ENTITY but I wonder if $ENTITY is part of a band. $ENTITY I always feel like she would break any instrument the moment she picked it up... 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Mmm. Smells like ... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY I see. $ENTITY So this is $ENTITY 's room! $ENTITY Yeah, it's got a nice vibe to it!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Heh heh.... If you keep looking around like that, $ENTITY it's kind of rude to $ENTITY , don't you think?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Wait... Somehow it smells like $ENTITY in here... Or am I just imagining things again?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Heh. This is $ENTITY 's room! $ENTITY Make yourself at home,... Well, $ENTITY I guess it's weird for ME $ENTITY to say something like that... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_An $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I wonder if all the furniture here is stuff $ENTITY picked out herself!
