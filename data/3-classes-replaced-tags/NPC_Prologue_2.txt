NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Mayor, this $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY will be your base of operations. $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY And I completely forgot to mention I'm on staff here too! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , your secretary, and I'm here to help you in any way I can.

NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY But $ENTITY if I may be frank, $ENTITY I was surprised to see someone as young as you step off the train. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY our former mayor held the position for many, many years and was quite set in his ways. $ENTITY But youth is a breath of fresh air. And exactly the new image our town needs! $ENTITY You're perfect for the job!

NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY All right... Of course we need you to get started right away on your work as mayor. Therefore, $ENTITY first we must complete your resident registration.

NPC Prologue 2 .... you haven't decided where to build your house yet, have you? If that's the case, we have to find a plot of land right away! $ENTITY I'm sorry I made you come all this way just to send you back out again... $ENTITY On the other side of the tracks over on $ENTITY Main Street $ENTITY , there's a real-estate office. It's called $ENTITY Nook's Homes... You really can't miss it once you get to $ENTITY Main Street $ENTITY !
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY one more thing... $ENTITY Having the town pay for your living costs $ENTITY might be taking the idea of business expenses a bit far. $ENTITY You'll need to pay for things like a home loan on your own.
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Please come back here $ENTITY once you've got a place to live.
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY is located on $ENTITY Main... Street $ENTITY , just past the train tracks. $ENTITY Please check your map for more detailed information.

NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY This is bad! $ENTITY 
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY I can't believe I completely forgot something so vitally important! $ENTITY In order to register you as a town resident, $ENTITY we need your address for the form!
NPC Prologue 2 .... do you have a place to live yet?... There aren't any vacant houses here... but you can build one! $ENTITY We really should have you decide where you're going to live before we proceed! And here I made you come all the way to the town hall for nothing.... I apologize for being so flaky!
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Um, $ENTITY on the other side of the tracks, on $ENTITY Main Street... is ... ook's Homes $ENTITY , the real-estate office... . $ENTITY Ah yes!... This might make more sense if you take a look at your map!
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You're $ENTITY , right?... Welcome to $ENTITY !

NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY I'd like to start registering you $ENTITY as a resident.... But have you decided where you're going to live? Until this is sorted out, $ENTITY I really can't complete the registration process. $ENTITY I don't mean to make this hard... $ENTITY but please go to the real-estate office called $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY and work on getting a home first!
NPC Prologue 2 $ENTITY Please take a quick look at the map. $ENTITY Do you see the $ENTITY tracks at the top? $ENTITY Cross the tracks and continue north to get to $ENTITY Main Street $ENTITY .
