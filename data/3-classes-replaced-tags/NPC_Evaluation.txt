NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Woohoo! $ENTITY What a glorious town!... Pav $ENTITY wants to just sprawl out right here and caress the ground... . "Viva $ENTITY !" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Great galloping grasshoppers! Were I to give this town a rating, I'd say that it's exemplary, old bean!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Goodness gracious! I can say that, even from an academic standpoint, this town is simply the best! Hoo!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "It's great! The very best town ever! I wouldn't mind being mayor again for a town that looks like this!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Well, if I compared it to a letter, it would be written quite well, but the sender's name would be left off! "Anyway, it only has a tiny way still to go, so I hope it continues like this to become the best town ever!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Just between us, in the snowman industry, you'll constantly roll up in between first and second place. "But you always want to aim for that indisputable first place! It's a long, icy road, but keep on rolling!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "I heard a rumor that towns with good environments have low reset rates. Wonder if that's true... "Anyway, there's most definitely no denyin' that this town has a pretty good environment right now!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Well... I won't say that it's perfect, but it's really not all that bad either, you know? Getting close, though!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Oh yes, it really has a wonderful feeling! $ENTITY But perhaps... Well, it's also lacking just a little something." $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Well, they're certainly giving it their all! The difficult challenge is the reason town building is so worth it! $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "It seems that $ENTITY is starting to gain some attention as a popular sightseeing destination! "I hope they continue to work hard to really keep revitalizing this town! Eek eek!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Goodness gracious! Even from an academic standpoint, I must say this town is becoming quite good! "If the town grows like this, I have no doubt that its value will keep soaring ever higher, eh wot?" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "I think it's riding the so-so rails! $ENTITY So average!... 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY It's not a passing grade, but it's not really failing either... $ENTITY "It's like this town is more than friends but not ready to be a couple yet. It needs real commitment!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "I think it can only go up from here! $ENTITY So far to go!... 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Well, let's see now... Things are just getting started, so you'll certainly need to work as hard as you can! "This old man will be keeping an eye on things, so good luck!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Goodness gracious... Even from an academic standpoint, this town is really just getting started, wot! "There are ever so many topics for discussion, so I'd tackle them one at a time to help build this town! Hoo!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Hmmm... When it comes to letter writing and town building, I really think that consideration is the key. "Don't you think everyone in town could benefit from that little bit of good advice?" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Uh... I'm not sure if it's OK to write something like this, so forgive me... $ENTITY "I wonder if they could maybe pay a bit more attention to our town... Perhaps just a little?" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY It's like this town isn't even like a town at all! $ENTITY "For the honor of our good names, let's completely rebuild this place!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY This town is not very good in its current state, hm? $ENTITY "It may be time to work hard to turn these lemons into lemonade, yes?" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Er... No comment! Eek eek!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "I'm just gonna say this in advance and this is how everyone in town feels by the way, not just me..." "What's the deal here?! $ENTITY That's all!" $ENTITY 
NPC Evaluation $ENTITY "Ahhhh, this is the pits... $ENTITY What's going to happen to this town... ? The whole place is just one big mess. "Anyway, there's nothing to like in this town, as far as I can see." $ENTITY
