OT Dt Museum_Art $ENTITY This place is so much better than a stuffy old art museum where they make you walk a particular route. $ENTITY Here you can spend as much or as little time as you want looking at your favorites.... !
OT Dt Museum_Art $ENTITY I like to imagine decorating my own house with all the best artwork in this gallery. $ENTITY And maybe someday, $ENTITY when I strike it rich, $ENTITY I'll actually take one home with me.
OT Dt Museum_Art $ENTITY I don't understand what makes a painting a classic. $ENTITY But I'll tell you one thing: $ENTITY it isn't the clothing. $ENTITY Everything in old paintings is out of style. $ENTITY Who thought that satin pantaloons were a good look?
OT Dt Museum_Art $ENTITY Do you know how to fully appreciate paintings,... I start by imagining the artists. $ENTITY What kind of life did they have? $ENTITY What was their inspiration? $ENTITY Did they know their work would be timeless?
OT Dt Museum_Art $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I've done some modeling. $ENTITY I wonder if there's an artist in $ENTITY who would paint me? $ENTITY I'm a natural! $ENTITY And it would be a fabulous way to preserve my beauty for future generations.
