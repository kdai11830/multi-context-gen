FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Sometimes I'll stay home on $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY to greet all the trick-or-treaters!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY The atmosphere around here on $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY gives me goose bumps...... Don't you just love this holiday?!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Even though $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY can be a little scary, $ENTITY I'm determined to celebrate it with everyone. $ENTITY See? $ENTITY This is my determined face!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY When you think of $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , you think of pumpkins.... And when I think of pumpkins... I think of all the interesting ways you can cook them. $ENTITY They're very versatile vegetables! $ENTITY Actually, $ENTITY did you know pumpkins are fruit, $ENTITY not vegetables? $ENTITY It's true! $ENTITY I'm not trying to trick you,... . $ENTITY But be careful. $ENTITY Tonight is a night of mischief! $ENTITY Have a fun and just slightly scary $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY !
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I have lots of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ready to go $ENTITY in case somebody tries to scare me! $ENTITY And if there's any left over, $ENTITY I'll have a sweet treat for my reading hour.
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You've probably noticed $ENTITY is different tonight,... It's $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Just be careful if you walk around town with $ENTITY candy... Spooky things might try to take it!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You might not expect it, $ENTITY but I really like ghosts. $ENTITY I've read all kinds of interesting ghost stories, $ENTITY !
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY a monster?... I don't think they're very scary. $ENTITY But their complexions are so poor, $ENTITY I just worry they're not eating a balanced diet.
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY A really big bug? $ENTITY I'm not scared of insects at all. $ENTITY Actually, $ENTITY if there were a species that big, $ENTITY I'd love the chance to research it.
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY A werewolf... I'm fine with them. $ENTITY They're just animals that act like people.... What's scary about that?
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY A mummy... Oh, you mean the guys wrapped in bandages, right? $ENTITY I'm not scared of them. $ENTITY If I saw one,... I would help rewrap its bandages so it doesn't trip.
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY What would I do if I saw a skeleton?... I think... I'd ask it lots of questions. $ENTITY Or tell it lots of jokes $ENTITY to tickle its funny bone!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I already gave you a treat, $ENTITY so please go away!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY But I already gave you a treat! $ENTITY Isn't that enough?
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY EEK!... Can't you just leave me alone?
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Who are you?!... Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY wearing THAT costume! $ENTITY You won't get it that easily! $ENTITY We're going to play a game. $ENTITY If you win, $ENTITY I'll hand over a piece of $ENTITY candy... But if I win... You're in for a surprise.
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Oh!... You were trying to scare me, $ENTITY weren't you? $ENTITY I'm sorry, $ENTITY but $ENTITY that's not nearly enough to frighten me. $ENTITY Since you came here to scare me, $ENTITY it's only fair I get to pull a prank on you in return! $ENTITY But $ENTITY I suppose we could play a game instead.... If you win,... I'll give you a piece of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ! $ENTITY If you lose... I'll play a trick on you after all,... .
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY That's what you get for trying to scare me!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Isn't that a neat trick? $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY what do you think of my revenge?
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY EEEEEEK! $ENTITY Go away,... If it's $ENTITY candy... you want, $ENTITY please take this piece and leave me alone!

FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY EEEP! $ENTITY Oh no, oh no, not this! $ENTITY Not ... Please, $ENTITY will you take this piece of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and go away? $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY Y $ENTITY -you're carrying too much in your pockets! $ENTITY Now what am I going to do?!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Now that I've given you $ENTITY candy... will you please just go away?!
FU Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY You have your $ENTITY candy... so please stop frightening me!
FU Ev HalloweenB Whew. $ENTITY I'm all out of fear for the day,... .
