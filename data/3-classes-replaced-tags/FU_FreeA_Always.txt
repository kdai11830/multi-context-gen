FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Spring is the season when a young woman's fancy turns to reading new books,... . $ENTITY I wonder which books are out there waiting for me... Oh! $ENTITY Be still, my beating heart!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Summer is the season for reading on the beach,... Instead of jumping into the ocean,... I jump into whole other worlds!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Fall is the perfect season for curling up with a book, $ENTITY don't you think? $ENTITY I'm what you'd call a voracious reader,... I've already consumed 20 books this fall!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY During the winter, $ENTITY you can't beat curling up under a blanket with a good book. $ENTITY A good book and a cup of cocoa... That's a match made in heaven!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY This might seem random, but $ENTITY do you know what I'm thinking about right now?... The future. Yesterday.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY That's right!... For a while now I've been thinking about how to $ENTITY live my life on my own terms.... But... $ENTITY what exactly are my terms?... I should really get to know myself better.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY No! $ENTITY I'm not thinking about the future.... I've already got enough on my mind at the moment! I'm actually wondering where I put the $ENTITY I bought yesterday. I just can't seem to remember.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY You're right! $ENTITY You know me too well. $ENTITY Yesterday $ENTITY somebody gave me some ... so I'm trying to decide when I should eat it.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Rather than the past, $ENTITY my mind is filled with thoughts of the future... There's so much I want to do and not enough time to do it! $ENTITY I'm trying to come up with a master plan.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Actually, $ENTITY do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment? $ENTITY About the world! Um...nothing?
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY You're right!... I've been thinking about how we can bring peace to the world. $ENTITY And because global change starts locally, $ENTITY for now, $ENTITY I'm thinking about how to bring peace to this town!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY I am so thinking!... I'm thinking about this conversation we're having!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I know this is out of the blue, but do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment? $ENTITY About aliens. About baby chicks.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY You're absolutely right. $ENTITY I've always been fascinated by outer space. $ENTITY I would love to be an astronaut and visit other planets. $ENTITY It'd be like a space safari!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Yep, you're right. $ENTITY Baby chicks start off yellow, $ENTITY but their color changes as they get older... I wonder if MY color will change as I get older!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY This might seem sort of random, $ENTITY but do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment? $ENTITY Gloves. Socks.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY That's right!... I've been carrying my coins in this glove I don't wear anymore. But the clerks at the store always look at me funny, $ENTITY so maybe I should get an actual change purse.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY That's right. $ENTITY I've been thinking I should knit a new pair of gloves. $ENTITY Last time I tried, $ENTITY I got carried away and knit 13 fingers. Knitting is sort of mesmerizing that way.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY You're right.... The other day, $ENTITY I went to $ENTITY 's house and took off my shoes. $ENTITY And I was embarrassed to discover I had a hole in my sock! $ENTITY I didn't want ... #x0; $ENTITY to notice, $ENTITY so I hid my foot, $ENTITY but then I had to hop around the house on one leg. $ENTITY On the plus side, $ENTITY I looked so weird hopping around $ENTITY that ... #x0; didn't notice the hole in my sock.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Yes, that's right.... I've been wearing my socks to sleep at night. $ENTITY But when I wake up, $ENTITY my socks are on the floor... .and my feet feel like ice. $ENTITY So $ENTITY I'm thinking of using duct tape around my ankles to keep my socks from slipping off in bed.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY !"#
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Yesterday, $ENTITY I picked up a letter that $ENTITY must have dropped... I knew it was wrong to read it, $ENTITY but I couldn't resist! $ENTITY Please don't tell anyone else! I was so ashamed of myself afterward that I left the letter where I found it. $ENTITY But now that I think about it... I wonder if I should have delivered it instead. $ENTITY What if someone else picked it up and read it, $ENTITY and it's all my fault?! $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I found a single rubber boot while walking to $ENTITY 's house the other day. $ENTITY took that boot and put some flowers in it just like a vase! $ENTITY Isn't that a great idea?! $ENTITY I think I might try it out too.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY The other day $ENTITY I found a handmade kaleidoscope. $ENTITY When I looked into it, $ENTITY it didn't have beads and glass inside. $ENTITY Instead, it was filled with rice and beans. $ENTITY It was strange but a little bit genius too.... No wonder it had "Property of $ENTITY " written on the side.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I picked up a diary that someone dropped the other day.... I know I shouldn't have, $ENTITY but I peeked inside. $ENTITY It said: "Day one: Played a lot. $ENTITY Day two: Played a lot today too. $ENTITY Day three: $ENTITY .... .Sure played a lot." $ENTITY And it was like that on every page!... What's the point in keeping a diary like that?!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I picked up a handwritten memo on the beach yesterday. $ENTITY It said: $ENTITY "To go left, or to go right. ... That is the question." $ENTITY Do you think that was a serious question, $ENTITY or was the writer feeling philosophical? $ENTITY I really want to know!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Lately, I've been into wearing my pajamas inside out and backward. $ENTITY Ever since I started doing that, $ENTITY I haven't had a single bad dream.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My latest obsession is sleeping in the space between the bed and the wall. $ENTITY Since I started doing that, $ENTITY I don't wake up with a crick in my neck.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've taken up calligraphy recently. $ENTITY But to make it more of a challenge, $ENTITY I do it on tissue paper! $ENTITY I can't begin to describe how good it feels to finish a letter without tearing the paper!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Can I confide in you? $ENTITY I pressed some $ENTITY between books to make decorations later. $ENTITY Then the other day, $ENTITY I mistook them for tea leaves... $ENTITY And I accidentally made $ENTITY drink my pressed-flower tea! $ENTITY Please don't tell ... #x0; $ENTITY about it!

FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been stuck in a rut lately when it comes to doing laundry. $ENTITY And I think changing things up a bit might make the chore seem more appealing. $ENTITY I've already been trying new things.... Like what? OK...
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY One thing I've been doing is hanging my clothes on a scarecrow to dry. $ENTITY But sometimes $ENTITY starts talking to the scarecrow without realizing it's not me.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Like hanging each item of clothing on the end of my fishing rod and drying it that way. $ENTITY The fact that my clothes smell like the river later is all part of the fun!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY If you come up with any good ideas for how to spice up the whole clothes-drying thing, $ENTITY let me know!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Lately, I've been getting bored with my routine for slicing veggies... I thought, if I changed how I've been doing it, it wouldn't feel like such a chore. So I've been trying out a few things.... #x0; Like what? OK...
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I turn on $ENTITY and slice my veggies to the beat. $ENTITY I think it's improving my sense of rhythm too!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY If you come up with any good ideas, please let me know!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY ;
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I'm curious, $ENTITY . What kind of books do you like to read? $ENTITY Fantasy novels. Mysteries. Dictionaries.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY What kind of books do you like, ... Picture books. Encyclopedias. Poetry collections.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY What kind of books do you like, ... Picture books. Mysteries. Encyclopedias.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Really?... I love a good fantasy novel. $ENTITY Where else can you hang out with orcs, $ENTITY wizards, $ENTITY and unicorns?... I just love unicorns.
FU FreeA Always Oh, I totally agree. $ENTITY You can learn so much by reading a set of encyclopedias one volume at a time. $ENTITY It can be a little dry, $ENTITY but it's worth it. $ENTITY Knowledge is priceless!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I love them too! $ENTITY They remind me of being a little kid and learning how to read. $ENTITY That's why opening a picture book makes me feel so content.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, I feel the same way! $ENTITY I try not to read them before bed, though. $ENTITY Because once I start a mystery, $ENTITY I can't stop until I know how it ends!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY Reading a dictionary cover to cover seems like it might get boring. $ENTITY But there's so much to learn from a dictionary $ENTITY that it would probably be worth it!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY me too!... I love how poetry can express such big ideas in just a few small words. $ENTITY I'd love for you to share your favorite collections with me sometime. $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been studying really hard for my marmalade-making proficiency exam. Even if I don't end up making a career out of it, $ENTITY it'll be useful for getting out of sticky situations. $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been studying hard for my dictionary proficiency exam, so I've memorized lots of word definitions. $ENTITY I can also tell you the number of pages in a whole bunch of different dictionaries!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been studying really hard for my bread-baking proficiency exam. $ENTITY Even if I don't end up making a career out of it, $ENTITY it's a skill that should help me rise to the top. $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been practicing really hard for my calligraphy proficiency exam. $ENTITY The best part is getting to write my name on the exam paper!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I read so many books, I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one. $ENTITY I even have an idea for it! $ENTITY I could write down the things you and I talk about $ENTITY and turn that into a collection of essays.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I read so many books, I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one. $ENTITY That's why I'm going to write $ENTITY and the Diabolical $ENTITY . $ENTITY You'll be the main character, and it'll be a story about your friendship with ... . $ENTITY Oh, and an evil $ENTITY !
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I read so many books, I was thinking it would be fun to try writing one. $ENTITY I even have an idea! Doesn't a story called... Wild World $ENTITY sound interesting?... Sure does! Hmmm...
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I know!... and $ENTITY would be in it. $ENTITY And it'd be about all the crazy days we spend in this one town. $ENTITY Once I have a rough draft, I'll be sure to show it to you! $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always Aw... I was planning to make you the main character too. $ENTITY That's too bad.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I read so many books, $ENTITY I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one.... #x0; Yeah, it might be. You should do it!
FU FreeA Always I mean, $ENTITY I'd like to, $ENTITY but there aren't a lot of story ideas to be found in my ordinary life... I'll have to start by making my life more exciting,... .
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY I'd like to, $ENTITY but what should I write about... Oh, I know! $ENTITY I'll interview all my friends $ENTITY and turn their answers into a children's book. $ENTITY How does that sound? $ENTITY I just need to come up with some really tough, $ENTITY probing questions. $ENTITY Hard-hitting stuff!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY ^
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Do you like writing letters, ... #x0;( Sure do! Not really.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I knew you would! $ENTITY I love reading and writing letters too. $ENTITY But sometimes, even though I put a lot of effort into writing one... $ENTITY I just can't figure out what to write last, $ENTITY so I end up never mailing it. $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I see. $ENTITY Chatting face-to-face is fun, but sometimes I like to organize my thoughts by writing them down.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I really enjoy writing letters. $ENTITY What about you, ... #x0;( I do too. Not really.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I thought you would.... You have that $ENTITY letter-writing look to you. $ENTITY Sometimes it's hard to tell people how you feel directly, $ENTITY and it's easier to be forthright in a letter.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, I see.... I find it handy to include a present with my letter if I've been too busy to visit someone.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Do you like getting letters, ... #x0;( I sure do! Not really.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I love getting them too! $ENTITY It's fun to chat face-to-face, $ENTITY but I like being able to read my favorite letters more than once.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, I see... I guess when I write to you, $ENTITY I'll have to write about something that will really grab your attention!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY When this season rolls around, $ENTITY it always makes me think of the same thing...

FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My mom used to make us soup using these little spring vegetables. $ENTITY She'd gather them up while thinning out the garden, and let them simmer all day on the stove... Someday I'd like to taste $ENTITY the soup of my memories again.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY The strawberry jam my mom would make for us! $ENTITY I liked eating it on top of her freshly baked bread. $ENTITY Just thinking about it is making me wistful $ENTITY and hungry.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Sometimes my dad would bring home a watermelon for us. $ENTITY We'd let it chill in the fridge for a while and then slice it into wedges. $ENTITY Add a sprinkle of salt, $ENTITY take a bite, and $ENTITY mmm!... It's one of my favorite memories of summer.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My mom would make salads with fresh tomatoes from our garden. $ENTITY The dressing she'd make to go with them was just delicious... I should try making it sometime.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY The apples I'd pick with my parents!... They'd make a caramel sauce to eat with them that was the best!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My dad's recipe for garlic mashed potatoes! $ENTITY The combination of fluffy potatoes, $ENTITY butter, $ENTITY and savory garlic just can't be beat!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My mom's veggie stew!... It would simmer all day long, $ENTITY and the smell of it just made my mouth water.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My dad's potato gratin.... It was warm and creamy, making it the perfect food for a cold winter's day!
FU FreeA Always s $ENTITY #x0;
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I've been making sandwiches for lunch lately, $ENTITY but $ENTITY they don't taste like the ones my mom used to make. $ENTITY I think her not-so-secret ingredient was a little bit of love.
FU FreeA Always The other day $ENTITY I packed a picnic lunch, but I forgot to pack any napkins! $ENTITY It was so messy that I wound up using leaves instead... I kind of felt like a wild animal! $ENTITY 
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Do you like baking, ... #x0;( I sure do! Meh.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY I knew you would! $ENTITY I love baking too. $ENTITY We should trade baking tips... So here's one for you: $ENTITY make sure your cake is completely cool before you frost it!
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Aw, that's too bad.... I was hoping we could have an oven-cleaning party,... .

FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Don't you think laundry dried outside smells like the sun? $ENTITY It smells so good, $ENTITY sometimes I'll fall asleep with my head buried in the laundry basket.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY My mom always said to shake out your clothes before hanging them up to dry. $ENTITY It helps to prevent wrinkles. $ENTITY Not that wrinkles in your clothes are the end of the world. $ENTITY Stains are.
FU FreeA Always The other day, $ENTITY I put too much detergent in the washing machine. $ENTITY The bubbles overflowed and flooded the whole room with me in it! $ENTITY On the bright side, $ENTITY it sort of felt like floating in lavender clouds.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Do you ever make snowmen, ... First roll up two snowballs for the head and body. $ENTITY Then put them on top of each other, $ENTITY and you've got yourself a snowman! $ENTITY It's kind of hard to make one that's perfectly balanced, $ENTITY but $ENTITY I bet you're pretty good at it.
FU FreeA Always $ENTITY Do you ever make snowmen, ... First roll up two snowballs for the head and body. $ENTITY Then put them on top of each other, $ENTITY and you've got yourself a snowman! $ENTITY I hear snowmen of different sizes have different personalities.... Isn't that neat?
