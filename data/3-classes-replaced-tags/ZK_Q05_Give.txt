ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Huh?... Well, you're just teasing me, $ENTITY aren't you, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Ah... This is a decoration I'd hang up on a wall, right,... I'm sorry.... That's not exactly what I was looking for. $ENTITY I was thinking $ENTITY something else!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY Wow, this furniture is... a lot larger than I expected. $ENTITY I could really use something more on the small side. $ENTITY Then maybe I'd keep it around... 
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY This furniture... is a lot smaller than I was expecting. $ENTITY Something larger, $ENTITY that's quite a different story. $ENTITY #xE;But this... 
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh... This decoration is for my wall, $ENTITY right,... ? I'm sorry. $ENTITY It's not what I want right now. I need $ENTITY something that fits on my floor!... Something the same size as the $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY This furniture... is bigger than I was expecting. $ENTITY Wow, if only it weren't so big, I'd go ahead and keep it... I'd say something only as big as the $ENTITY and no bigger.... That's what we need!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY This... is smaller than I was hoping it'd be. $ENTITY Oh, if only it were a bit larger, $ENTITY then I'd probably keep it... I have a hunch I'm looking for something the same size as the ... 
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh?... But... you just gave me another $ENTITY You got the size idea right, but I want something that's totally not ... Don't beat yourself up about it,... Just pick yourself up, and let's try again!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY This piece of furniture is nice... But it's like you weren't listening to me at all. This can't be set on top of the $ENTITY , which is what I really need... So we're going to try this again, and when I say "we," I mean "you." OK,... ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Ah... This decoration is for my wall, $ENTITY right,... ? $ENTITY Then I'm sorry. $ENTITY That isn't what I want. I'm looking for furniture I can use to replace the $ENTITY I just don't need anything else.
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY This... doesn't make me want to get up and dance. I can't replace the $ENTITY I need something that can be placed on top of something, so you sort of missed the point... I need something that can go on top of tables and such, OK?... Got that, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY You brought... Hmm. Just $ENTITY I'm looking for something entirely different from my old, boring ... Don't be too hard on yourself,... I'm sure you'll get it if you keep trying.
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY I don't know how you expect me to put this furniture up on my wall!... I'd need a lot of glue! $ENTITY I really want something for my wall.... You can figure that out on your own, I'm sure, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You brought... just ... . $ENTITY That's what I already have, though. What I'm looking for is to replace the $ENTITY on my wall... But don't be too hard on yourself,... Picking the right kind of furniture can be really hard, right?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY I feel like I've seen this thing somewhere before... Ah, that's right!... I have this exact piece in my room already! $ENTITY And I do mean EXACT!... ! Sorry, but I can't accept this. $ENTITY If possible, $ENTITY I'd prefer something I DON'T already own... 
ZK Q05 Give I think the $ENTITY and I will get along just fine... Perhaps even better than us!
ZK Q05 Give OK, $ENTITY Mr. ... let me show you to your new home with me... .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY My... It's like he's been here for years and years already!... He just looks so settled in, $ENTITY !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY Yeah, that's a good choice, isn't it? Not bad, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY I almost didn't recognize it since it's been remade so well!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I'll be sure to set this out later when I have the place to myself again, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I'll make sure to set this up in my room when I make my way home, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's see if we can find a place for this to go!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY It looks pretty good, right? I mean, of course it looks pretty good, but you agree, right?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Take my $ENTITY with you. I'm cutting back on stuff anyway, so that'll be your reward!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Thank you, ... I'd be only too lucky if you'd just move in and help me like this every day!
ZK Q05 Give I see... So you decided to go with $ENTITY , huh?... That's a pretty stylish choice!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Hmm. This seems kind of unusual... , right?... Oh, that's why! $ENTITY It's a remake!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I'll set it out later when I have the place all to myself, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I'll be sure to set this out as soon as I get home, $ENTITY !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Hmm... I wonder where this would look best... 
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Hmm... I'll just have to do a bit of thinking before setting it up, so it'll be up later, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Let's put it over there!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Doesn't it just look fantastic?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh, wait! $ENTITY I need to show my thanks for this, right?... ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY A dear gift to my dear friend! $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Whoa, wow! $ENTITY I can't believe it! It's ... This is going to make my dance routines so much simpler to choreograph!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY So you've gone out and found $ENTITY this might just give my room an intellectual sort of feel.... That's perfect, $ENTITY !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh!... maybe I won't feel lonely when I'm by myself... Er,... I'm just kidding!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh!... You'll be my friend, won't you? $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY Are you a Mr. or a Ms.? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you're a nice fishy!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Oh!... This little fella will always make it feel like the ocean is right here with me, $ENTITY .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY What should he be named then?... Ooh, maybe ... Just kidding! $ENTITY Hah ha!
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Well now... A good place for this special ... I got it! $ENTITY Right over there!... You can see me from here, can't you, my new pet?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY I get the feeling that this special $ENTITY and I will become besties, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY YOU brought it to me, $ENTITY and WE'RE besties, $ENTITY right, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Hmmmm. $ENTITY Well, I'd better give you something good as a really nice thank-you,... .
ZK Q05 Give Originally owned by yours truly,... it's ... I bet they'd pay a premium for stuff as nice as that up in the shops!... Eh, just kidding!... I'm still really thankful, though,... !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Hmmmm. $ENTITY Well, I should certainly reward you with something better than a thanks, right?... ?
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY It's ... If I ever need my home redesigned again,... I'll be sure to ask for your help,... !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY if I'm not mistaken... ... I should probably make some space on a table or something then. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess I can decide where to display stuff later... .
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY Thank you, ... Take my $ENTITY as a little appreciation gift,... !
ZK Q05 Give $ENTITY If there's anything else... would it be OK for me to ask for your help again, $ENTITY ?
