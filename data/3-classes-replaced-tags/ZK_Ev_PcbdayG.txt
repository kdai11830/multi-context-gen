ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY It's another step... toward becoming a grown-up,... !
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY Ah,... so you were born in $ENTITY ? $ENTITY So that would make you $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY No wait! $ENTITY #xE;Zodiac signs aren't broken perfectly into months! $ENTITY Aha! Let's just assume you were born under the sign of $ENTITY Awesome and leave it at that!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY 
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY I'm thankful $ENTITY just to get a chance to be your friend! $ENTITY Happy birthday,... !
ZK Ev PcbdayG ... how old are you now? $ENTITY Oh... uh, $ENTITY that wasn't rude, was it?
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY I feel like somehow this is fate... , you and I were born on the exact same day!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY That reminds me $ENTITY you and me, we were born on the same day, right? $ENTITY Does that make us twins...? $ENTITY Ooh! Ooh!... Mwa ha ha! $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE;... Hah ha!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY It's sort of surprising that you were born on New Year's Day... It's like every birthday is a fresh start!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY If you were born on February 29th during a leap day, does that mean you only age once every 4 years? I really hope you don't feel bad about being born on a leap day, $ENTITY . $ENTITY At least it makes your real birthday extra special when it comes around! $ENTITY Don't you think that's lovely?
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY You're either really lucky or really unlucky having a birthday on February 29th! $ENTITY Since this is a leap year, I'd say you lean more toward lucky! $ENTITY I'm so honored to be part of such a rare birthday party,... !
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY It must be nice to have a birthday on ... , since it's easy to remember it, $ENTITY right, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I'll never forget your birthday! $ENTITY Yup, $ENTITY on my honor as a true $ENTITY , I'll never... Uh... What were we talking about again?
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY Wow, having your birthday the same night $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY 's coming... $ENTITY It's like he's bringing everyone gifts to celebrate your birthday! $ENTITY Oh no!... I hope he never accidentally gives your birthday gift to someone else instead!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY , it's so festive that your birthday is the day after $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY came to town!... That has to be a little frustrating some years, though, right?
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY Come on, $ENTITY don't be shy... Go ahead and blow out the candles on your birthday cake!
ZK Ev PcbdayG ... You like keeping us in suspense, don't you? $ENTITY You should blow out those candles now,... !
ZK Ev PcbdayG Hey, I didn't hear you blow out the candles on your cake yet... You need to do it! $ENTITY It's your only job today!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY Say,... even when you get older, you don't really look it. $ENTITY You always seem so youthful. $ENTITY What's your secret? $ENTITY You must be some sort of...of... $ENTITY a Time Wizard!... Oh man! That makes so much sense!
ZK Ev PcbdayG $ENTITY Hey,... you get older, but I've never seen you age. Like, ever. $ENTITY If I didn't know any better, $ENTITY I'd say you were using some sort of hacks to this whole game of life! $ENTITY Seriously, are you cheating? $ENTITY You look too pretty not to be cheating somehow... $ENTITY Like with cheat codes!
