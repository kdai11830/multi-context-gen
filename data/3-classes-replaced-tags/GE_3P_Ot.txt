GE 3P Ot $ENTITY That's quite a bold look you have on today. $ENTITY Are you trying to make a fashion statement, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Because if you are, $ENTITY you should totally let me give you a makeover! $ENTITY You'd look SO good in all PINK!
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY That's very kind of you, $ENTITY but I'm well aware of what colors look best on me. $ENTITY Maybe next time!
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY You can't base your wardrobe on what colors look good on you, $ENTITY silly. $ENTITY You have to be daring, natch!
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY I believe I'm quite daring $ENTITY in my own way. $ENTITY Sometimes $ENTITY I wear shoes without any socks! $ENTITY !
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY But if you went out on a ledge just a $ENTITY LITTLE, $ENTITY you'd grab the attention of everyone in town. $ENTITY You'd be, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY totally popular, $ENTITY ! I just know it!

GE 3P Ot $ENTITY Hey, ... We're forming a band! $ENTITY Do you want to be in it with us?
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY Hold on just a moment now! $ENTITY You never said anything to me $ENTITY about forming a band.
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY 
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY I totally did! I $ENTITY wrote you a letter and everything. $ENTITY It had a bunch of musical-note stickers! $ENTITY I was thinking that I'd be the lead singer and you could sing backup, $ENTITY . $ENTITY And $ENTITY could be our token $ENTITY "cute guy"! You know, so we'll get lots of girl fans! $ENTITY Whaddya think? $ENTITY That sounds awesome! Not my cup of tea.
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY Hold on! What are we getting into here? $ENTITY What if $ENTITY and I get $ENTITY stage fright or something?

GE 3P Ot $ENTITY See? Even $ENTITY thinks this is a terrible idea.
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY is just playing hard to get! He knows that our band will be, like, SUPER hot!
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY I totally did! I $ENTITY wrote you a letter and everything. $ENTITY It had a bunch of musical-note stickers! $ENTITY I was thinking that I'd be the lead singer and you could sing backup, $ENTITY . $ENTITY And $ENTITY could be OK on the tambourine! Whaddya think? $ENTITY Sign me up! I hate the tambourine.
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY How do we know $ENTITY can even PLAY the tambourine? $ENTITY It's not an easy instrument to master.
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY She can do anything she puts her mind to! $ENTITY I believe in $ENTITY . $ENTITY And I believe in you too, $ENTITY !
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY is obviously intimidated by the tambourine idea. $ENTITY If anything, $ENTITY she should play the harpsichord!
GE 3P Ot $ENTITY I'm the lead singer, $ENTITY so I get to say who plays what! $ENTITY But if she wants to play the harpsichord, that's cool.
