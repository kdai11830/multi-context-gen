AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY Oh, howdy!... You from ... Heh, yeah I can tell. $ENTITY I used to live here too. ... I'm a bit stuck in my ways, so I still come here to shop a lot. $ENTITY !
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY It's kinda weird to have a town with the station on one end and so much greenery everywhere else... I used to live here, but even I forget the lay of the land outside the shopping area, $ENTITY !
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY Heh heh. $ENTITY I still kinda remember the locations of the stores and what they sell... mostly. $ENTITY I guess that shows how impactful this shopping district really is! $ENTITY !
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY Leaving town doesn't mean my turf changed. $ENTITY Naw, man. It expanded! $ENTITY If I feel like it, I'll come back here anytime I like! $ENTITY !
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY #x0;
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY Yaaaawn... Main Street's open?... Things get started early here... .
AN Dt FirstB What gives? $ENTITY Things should be crazy busy right now. $ENTITY It's way too chill... .
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY I love how the shopping district looks at night with all the lights on... .
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY It's the middle of the night, $ENTITY but some stores are still open... What goes on in these places?
AN Dt FirstB $ENTITY Nothing's changed! $ENTITY Things are the same as they were back when I lived here!... !
