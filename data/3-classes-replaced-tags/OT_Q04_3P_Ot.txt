OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Ah!... !
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Great job, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Thanks for tracking down $ENTITY for me.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Oh good! $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Where have you been,... I can't even remember what I asked you to do. $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY You were going to find $ENTITY for me.... And it looks like you did. $ENTITY #xE;
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY What's this all about, $ENTITY ? I don't like being urgently summoned.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY What's up,... didn't tell me what this was about.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY So $ENTITY what's this all about,... It's so mysterious, $ENTITY you summoning me... 
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY sorry if this isn't too exciting, $ENTITY but I just remembered that I had something of yours. $ENTITY And I've kind of been borrowing it for an embarrassingly long time. $ENTITY So I wanted to give it back!
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY But I wasn't really in a hurry to get it back or anything. $ENTITY Still, $ENTITY I appreciate the thought.... Thanks, $ENTITY !
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I know how you like these things, $ENTITY and I just happened to see one when I was shopping... So I bought it for you! $ENTITY I hope you like it.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You got me ... Just when I thought our friendship was a little bit on the fritz, $ENTITY you go and do something like this. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY 
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the other day I was just taking a stroll on the beach... and I found something of yours. $ENTITY It seemed like something you'd want to hang on to, $ENTITY so I grabbed it for you.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY No way! $ENTITY Is that my old ... I'm so glad you saved it for me! $ENTITY I couldn't believe I lost it. $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY I'll remember this... 
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY please don't laugh, $ENTITY but I had a dream last night that I just needed to tell you about. $ENTITY You were selected to be the Earth's fashion ambassador to the solar systemand living in a moon base! Now I know it was just a dream,... but I was worried that it was symbolic of you moving away in real life.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Ha! $ENTITY I wouldn't set foot off the planet for that title. $ENTITY They'd need to make me fashion ambassador to the entire galaxy to make it worth my while. $ENTITY But seriously, $ENTITY I'm not going anywhere.... So you can relax and go back to dreaming about shoes.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you know how you've been having a hard time getting to sleep lately? $ENTITY I read that putting a lavender- scented candle near your bed can help! $ENTITY Just thought you should know.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Oh yeah, $ENTITY did you see that in a magazine? $ENTITY I think I read the same thing. $ENTITY I've been meaning to try it. $ENTITY Thanks for the tip!
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Thanks for bringing me over here,... , $ENTITY but I'm sorry you had to sit through all that. $ENTITY Maybe $ENTITY will give you a little something for your trouble, $ENTITY though. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I need to get home. $ENTITY I've got a cup of $ENTITY calling my name.
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY if that's it, $ENTITY I suppose I should head home. $ENTITY I'm sure we all have things to do. $ENTITY Thanks for the walk, ... We should all get together sometime under more normal circumstances.... !
OT Q04 3P_Ot $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY then. $ENTITY This has been quite an experience. $ENTITY I'm going home now. $ENTITY Oh, ... you might have some unfinished business with $ENTITY here. $ENTITY Just a hunch.
