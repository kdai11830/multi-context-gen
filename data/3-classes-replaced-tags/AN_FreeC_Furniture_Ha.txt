AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Did you know $ENTITY used to catch fish while swimming? $ENTITY Some kind of training regimen, I guess. $ENTITY But rumor has it he wrestled ... and lost! So he gave up the sport for good! $ENTITY It sounds like one of those things that's so weird it must be true! ... 
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I would have thought $ENTITY would go for $ENTITY poster instead of a painting! $ENTITY Isn't he that type? $ENTITY I'm honestly pleasantly surprised, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I'm surprised to find a plant here, but maybe $ENTITY needs extra oxygen when he works out. $ENTITY You don't think he's eating these things for his health, do you? $ENTITY ?
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Is this $ENTITY ? It is, isn't it? $ENTITY He's really doing it! $ENTITY training! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha The other day $ENTITY was like, $ENTITY "I gotta watch the $ENTITY tournament!" And he ran home! $ENTITY Hasn't he ever heard of recording stuff? $ENTITY ?
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY says he's created a workout routine using ... I really can't imagine what that would look like! ... 
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY 's specialty dish... is apparently a ginger and garlic $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Man! I can practically smell it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY The other day $ENTITY and I had a talk about how you need strength to be able to sleep really well... Since then he's been trying out all kinds of crazy things to get stronger so he can have the best sleep ever!... But I think in his excitement he forgot all about his beloved weight lifting... which would be perfect!
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I think that "bouncy wrestling ring" $ENTITY was telling me about was just his big bed... I can see how he'd get confused. But at least he probably won't get hurt! $ENTITY ! $ENTITY 
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Hey, have you ever stuck your feet under a sofa to do sit-ups? $ENTITY The trick is to not go up all the way, or you'll hurt your back!... Oh, dude! Being in $ENTITY 's house is making even me talk about hard-core training!
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY says he doesn't really take naps... What a waste! $ENTITY A big sofa like this is the perfect place for a good nap, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I think $ENTITY must have a crazy-high body temperature! $ENTITY I sat down in a chair after he was in it, and my butt got hot! $ENTITY I bet it's another side effect of all his training. $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha Sometimes $ENTITY catches bugs without a net! It must take amazing reflexes to do that! $ENTITY And you'd have to not be afraid of touching a bug. $ENTITY I bet catching ... was a snap for him! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY You know, I bet $ENTITY has a ton of old workout contraptions stashed in his closet. $ENTITY He could probably open his own gym with just the stuff he doesn't use anymore! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Wow! I guess $ENTITY doesn't just drink coffee at the caf! $ENTITY Course... he might be using the $ENTITY for high- protein, mass-gain coffee!
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY So this $ENTITY is the gyroid he takes care of! $ENTITY Heh heh heh! He's got pretty good taste! ... 
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY probably gets sweaty and then changes clothes all the time, right? $ENTITY Based on my observations, I'm gonna guess he'll change into his $ENTITY next!
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I knew $ENTITY got his hands on ... But I guess he isn't really using it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Ugh. Just looking at $ENTITY 's mirror makes me think about him... standing around ogling his own muscles all the time! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha There's this huge book called $ENTITY Pickles on the top shelf... I wonder what that's all about! $ENTITY ?
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY doesn't seem like he'd be too much of a neat freak. $ENTITY But this $ENTITY being out like this is a good sign! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Has $ENTITY stopped his bad habit of sniffing every fossil he comes across? $ENTITY I mean, I guess there are things you can't tell just by looking... But does that ever look weird! ...

AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Heh heh! I'm kinda digging the furniture in here, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Heh... So this place pretty much has everything, eh? $ENTITY ?
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Even if he had the same furniture as someone else, $ENTITY his personality would filter through!
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY This is a pretty good cleaning job. For $ENTITY , I mean... 
AN FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Heh! I'm always so self-conscious when I visit someone else's home! $ENTITY !
