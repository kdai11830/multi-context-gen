OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY What are you doing up this early? $ENTITY Are you getting ready for the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY too? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I wish you good luck. $ENTITY But not TOO good.... I want that first-place trophy!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I see you're up early practicing your bug-catching moves as well, $ENTITY eh,... ? $ENTITY So $ENTITY we'll be competing for the same first-place trophy. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY may the best bug catcher win. $ENTITY That's me!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Good luck in the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY today,... . Remember, it starts at $ENTITY 9 a.m. $ENTITY sharp! If there's one person I would like to see win $ENTITY other than myself $ENTITY it's you. $ENTITY , $ENTITY let's go!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY You know how the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY works, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY in case you need a refresher... Just start catching bugs, $ENTITY and then take them to $ENTITY Nat $ENTITY ! $ENTITY He'll rank each one and keep track of scores. Don't worry if you catch more than one of the same type of bug. $ENTITY They all count. $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I've said too much... 
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Let's all relax and take a break from the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY . $ENTITY What do you say, $ENTITY ?
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Take it easy, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Let the bugs come to you... 
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY It's a bug-catching marathon, $ENTITY not a bug-catching sprint. $ENTITY No need to panic just yet, $ENTITY .
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Normally I avoid bugs. $ENTITY But today I want them all to flock to me. $ENTITY Come, my pretties... muhahahahah!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I have a feeling one of us is going to win this whole tournament.... It's on,... ! $ENTITY !
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I didn't think I'd be into a contest that involves catching bugs,... but this is fun!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY You think a lady like myself can't get down in the dirt and catch bugs? $ENTITY Just watch,... !
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Running out of time, ... I hope you've caught as many whoppers as I have. $ENTITY I just need one more monster bug, $ENTITY and then I'll call it a day. $ENTITY Here, $ENTITY buggy, buggy, buggy... 
OT Ev Mushitori Well, $ENTITY the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY is almost over.... Did you do as well as you hoped?... May the best bug catcher win.
OT Ev Mushitori It's not how you start $ENTITY it's how you finish. $ENTITY So, ... how do you plan on finishing today?
OT Ev Mushitori Whew! $ENTITY The tourney's finally over. $ENTITY Now all that's left is to see who will take home the hardware... 
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY , $ENTITY I wonder what I should wear for the awards ceremony... 
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I want to look good up there on the awards podium, $ENTITY but I don't want to come off too flashy. $ENTITY I need an outfit that says "yes, $ENTITY I'm a bug-catching champion, $ENTITY but I'm totally down to earth."
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Please accept my sincere congratulations. $ENTITY !
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I guess this means you're the best bug catcher in ... Congrats!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Well, look at you, ... Nice job in the tourney! $ENTITY Better keep practicing, $ENTITY though... Next time I might not let you win. $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I knew we'd both do well in this tournament,... But I also knew I'd be standing at least one step higher at the end!... , $ENTITY no hard feelings.
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I talked a lot of trash during the competition... and managed to back it up completely! $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Look at us... two of the three top finishers in the $ENTITY Bug-Off... That probably almost makes up for the fact that I beat you, $ENTITY right,... ? $ENTITY !
OT Ev Mushitori Sorry that you weren't able to place in the $ENTITY Bug-Off... Don't feel bad. $ENTITY You're young, $ENTITY and your best bug-catching years are ahead of you.
OT Ev Mushitori What a shame,... . $ENTITY I thought for sure you'd be up on that podium today. $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY the competition WAS pretty tough. $ENTITY !
OT Ev Mushitori I hope you're not too disappointed with your results in the tourney today,... . $ENTITY If you get out there and practice, I'm sure you'll make the podium next time!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY So $ENTITY how did I look up there on the podium today? $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You didn't even go to the awards ceremony?... you missed my shining moment! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess I'll just have to dominate the next $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY too. $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev Mushitori On a scale of triumphant to heroic, how did I look on the podium today? $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You weren't at the awards ceremony? $ENTITY Think you're too cool for school, $ENTITY eh? ... 
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY Winning one of the top prizes at this tournament is great, $ENTITY but there's a lot of pressure $ENTITY too. I mean, $ENTITY what if you got up on the podium and your hair was messed up from chasing bugs all day? $ENTITY , the horror!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY There's something about standing up on that podium that's just glorious. $ENTITY I hope you get to experience it for yourself someday.
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY , $ENTITY did you hear? $ENTITY The $ENTITY Bug- Off $ENTITY awards ceremony was canceled! $ENTITY I wonder what they're going to do with all the bugs. $ENTITY Eww!
OT Ev Mushitori $ENTITY I can't believe the awards ceremony was canceled! $ENTITY A lot of people caught a lot of bugs today, $ENTITY but now we'll never know who caught the best ones.
