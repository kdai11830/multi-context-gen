NPC Jonny $ENTITY Oh... Are you my princess?... Kiss me and wake me from my endless slumber! $ENTITY Hey, wait a sec! $ENTITY Just who are you?! You don't look like no princess! $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Gulliver... just a humble little sailor of some note around the seven or eight seas. $ENTITY Wait? $ENTITY Could it be that YOU were the one who saved me? $ENTITY Oh my gosh! $ENTITY What have I done! $ENTITY I can't believe I was so rude to my rescuer! $ENTITY Find it in your heart to forgive me! $ENTITY That's what heroes do! $ENTITY Huh, I'm actually very confused at this exact moment.... I guess I went overboard and was tossed into the sea. $ENTITY Gah, $ENTITY typical. $ENTITY Probably my fault for dozing off on the side of a ship in the middle of the BIGGEST storm ever. $ENTITY I don't have a single memory of what happened after that. $ENTITY Sea amnesia, they call it. $ENTITY Come to think of it, $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I was on my way to someplace or another, since, $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY I'm a sailor. Hmmm. Where was I headed... ? If I could at least remember the name of the silly place... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Good morning! $ENTITY And how is this fine day treating you? $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Gulliver... a pure-blooded boy of the sea. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE;... I'm a man of the sea! $ENTITY Not a boy anymore! $ENTITY Would you listen to my manly tale?! $ENTITY I fell overboard in a pirate scuffle and was dumped into the ocean. $ENTITY Had to be 10no, $ENTITY 50 pirates! Next thing I knew, $ENTITY I was on this beach, $ENTITY snoffing salt water from my manly beak... "Canoe" believe it? $ENTITY "Buoy" that was a close one!... You $ENTITY were supposed to laugh! $ENTITY I put together a self-deprecating joke and a pun. $ENTITY Height of comedy. $ENTITY Please $ENTITY don't make me explain my jokes... Ah, it seems my ability to make people laugh is lost to the cruel mistress of the sea. ... Hey? $ENTITY That's not the only thing I've lost. $ENTITY I can't seem to remember a bunch of stuff! $ENTITY #xE;... I think I had that once. $ENTITY Maybe? So just where $ENTITY was I headed? $ENTITY Oh, man! $ENTITY This sure is a fuzzy pickle! $ENTITY I'm in way over my head here!
NPC Jonny $ENTITY No! $ENTITY Lizzy!... Go away!... STAY AWAY $ENTITY FROM ME!... Gasp! Gasp I say! $ENTITY Am I $ENTITY in the Overthere? $ENTITY If so, you must be an angel, right?... Ah, $ENTITY guess not. $ENTITY My name is $ENTITY Gulliver... I happen to be a simple sailor who travels the seven seas, searching for an eighth. $ENTITY Who?... Oh, $ENTITY Lizzy is the name of an old girlfriend of mine... Nah, I'm just foolin' ya. $ENTITY It's the name of the hurricane that attacked me!... WHOOSH! $ENTITY Lizzy sure was a rough dame.... Well, $ENTITY hurricane... After all, $ENTITY she completely blew all my memories clean from my head! $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I was heading somewhere. $ENTITY I just can't remember where that somewhere was... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY GAH!... What $ENTITY happened to me?! $ENTITY Where am I?!... Am I $ENTITY Gulliver $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY I remembered my name!... Nice to meet you! $ENTITY My name is $ENTITY Gulliver... I'm a sailor, of course. $ENTITY Oh, man. $ENTITY I think my cage got rattled pretty bad. $ENTITY I'm feeling a little birdbrained at the moment. $ENTITY Get it? $ENTITY Cause I'm a bird... HA! $ENTITY HA! $ENTITY HA! $ENTITY I quack me up! $ENTITY So... Hmmm. $ENTITY You're acting pretty calm about all this. $ENTITY So, $ENTITY . Cool Cat... Will you listen to my sad tale of doom and gloom? $ENTITY Truth is, $ENTITY I fell over the side of my boat and was swept away by the waves. Er,... it was because of a 90-foot SEA MONSTER! $ENTITY No,... TWO!... Hate when that happens... Blasted monsters stole my memory. $ENTITY And my sandwich. $ENTITY Where was my boat headed before it was hurled off course... I can't seem to remember, $ENTITY even with my trusty thinking cap on!
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Ach...... ACHOOOOOO! $ENTITY I'm so cold! $ENTITY Just how long was I out soaking in the deep blue, anyway... The tips of my wings are wrinkled like sad, depressed seaweed. $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Where are my manners!... I'm the jaunty sailor of the seven seas, $ENTITY Gulliver... But $ENTITY I can't seem to remember much more than that... I must have ambrosia $ENTITY or amnesty $ENTITY or something equally as serious. $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I was on my way to someplace super fun, though... I just can't remember where... Squaaaawwwk! $ENTITY Where in the whole wide world was I sailing to?!
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Oh, I know! $ENTITY It's so obvious!... Will you help me figure out where I was heading? $ENTITY Sure, I'll help you out. Sorry. I'm kinda busy.
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Oh, I know! $ENTITY You gotta help me! $ENTITY I'll tell you everything I remember, $ENTITY so will you please, please $ENTITY help me figure out where I was headed? $ENTITY You wouldn't abandon a poor yet manly seagull like me, would you? $ENTITY Sure, I'll help you out. Sorry. I'm kinda busy.
NPC Jonny $ENTITY You mean it?! $ENTITY I haven't met such a noble skipper since old Bobbery of Rogueport! $ENTITY Not even close! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY I suppose we should start with anything and everything I can remember about where I was going! ... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Oh, thanks! $ENTITY I haven't met someone so willing to help a total stranger since the residents of Ricco Harbor! $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY I'll tell you everything I remember about my destination before my mind goes blank. ... .
NPC Jonny ... The chill of the Ice Cavern is nothing compared to getting the cold shoulder... . $ENTITY Don't be one of those uncaring city folk my mom warned me about.... Take time to help your fellow bird! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY I'll start by telling you everything I can remember.... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Hmm... I guess I must seem very suspicious to you or something. $ENTITY Helping people builds good karma, $ENTITY so just help me figure this out, OK? $ENTITY All right, let's get started. $ENTITY I'm going to start telling you everything I remember. ... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY I promise I'll send you a fancy souvenir! $ENTITY It might take a while, but you'd better get your hopes up!
NPC Jonny .... Somehow, I think that's wrong. $ENTITY But $ENTITY I'll put my faith in you and make my way there anyway! $ENTITY What's stoppin' me, right?! $ENTITY Who knows? I might even send you a token from my voyage! $ENTITY It'll be small, so check your mailbox!
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Mya... Mya... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Uh, $ENTITY unnnnnn... I am the alpha male... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Nah, mom... Just give me... Five more minutes...
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY No! $ENTITY That's the port side! $ENTITY Starboard is on the right... It's because all starfish are right-handed... Zzzzzz...
NPC Jonny $ENTITY No... Today isn't a school day... Yeah, I checked... Zzzzzz...
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Nnnnnnnn... Don't do that... My beak isn't a can opener... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Nnnnnn... Cinnamon buns are not currency... Not yet, anyway... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Zzz... GAH! $ENTITY Nope, I'm still sleeping. Zzz... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Zzzz... I can't believe how seriously unconscious I am right now... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Mmmm... Lizzy... But you were my lobster... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY I'm just going to explore a bit before I take off again!
NPC Jonny $ENTITY I never get seasick! $ENTITY The rocking feels as if it was my own mother rocking me to sleep. However, $ENTITY I think I might be landsick. $ENTITY Burble blurble... $ENTITY Ugh, just talking about it is making me go from groggy to gloomy super quick... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Voyaging by boat is fun! $ENTITY The sea breeze takes all your cares away and turns them to sea salt! $ENTITY If something bad ever happens to you, $ENTITY hop on a boat and take to the high seas! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY unless your troubles all have to do with being stranded out at sea... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY The sea is fantastic! $ENTITY If you're sad or worried, $ENTITY the sea will wrap you in her arms like you're a baby in a blanket! $ENTITY She's just like my mom back home!... It's been a long time since I've had her spaghetti and wormballs...
NPC Jonny $ENTITY The boat I was riding on is way different from Mr. $ENTITY Kapp'n $ENTITY 's! $ENTITY It has the latest doodads and super- deluxe thingamabobbers! $ENTITY Still wasn't enough to keep me from going overboard, though.
NPC Jonny $ENTITY This outfit I'm wearing is the very symbol of a sailor! $ENTITY Plus it makes me look incredibly charming! $ENTITY Charm $ENTITY it'd just look silly to find me lying here on the beach. $ENTITY Can you imagine the look on your face if I were dressed as a cowboy?... Ooh, $ENTITY that's not a bad idea... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY This town... is definitely one of the smallest ports I've ever been to. $ENTITY With all the seas I've traveled and towns I've been to, $ENTITY this one feels like a tiny hamster cage!... I'm not saying $ENTITY it feels TOO small, though. $ENTITY I've seen bigger. $ENTITY Hoo, now Isle Delfino! $ENTITY THAT was a nice beach to wash up on... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY Just between the two of us, $ENTITY I've actually traveled the vastness of space as well! $ENTITY However, $ENTITY no one I've ever talked to believes any of my many harrowing tales of adventure. But let me tell you one thing I learned when floatin' about out there.... Space is DARK! $ENTITY 
NPC Jonny $ENTITY I never thought a seagull like me would be such dead weight once I hit the water. $ENTITY When I was a chick, $ENTITY I went to swim classes every week, $ENTITY though I did have water wings as a backup... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY I'm quite happy we had a chance to meet like this! $ENTITY I hope we can share another tale or two! $ENTITY But $ENTITY I'm a man of the sea... I might never return to this port! $ENTITY Yep, bet you'll never see me again! $ENTITY Either way,... Ha HAH! $ENTITY That's a good one... .
NPC Jonny $ENTITY AYE AYE, SIR! $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY How did you know my name i $ENTITY s $ENTITY Gulliver $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Hmmm... Come to think of it, $ENTITY have we met somewhere before? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY I lost my memories and can't remember important stuff!... Must be the sea amnesia! $ENTITY It tends to act up now and again,... especially at a time of least convenience! Point is, $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I was headed somewhere, $ENTITY but I can't remember where that was! $ENTITY You have to help me! $ENTITY Please help me try to refresh my lost and battered memory! $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY Sure thing. I'm kinda busy.
