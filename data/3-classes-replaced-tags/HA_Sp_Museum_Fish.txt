HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY This water tank... There's still a lot of space in here. I wish I could use some of this space for training. $ENTITY Freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly stroke! It's just a matter of time before I'm the world champ!
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY This room is really amazing! $ENTITY I hope they get more and more fish and continue to grow! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Museum_Fish This is awesome! Just look at the great variety of fish in here! $ENTITY There's just so many! I'm starting to feel dizzy just from looking at them! $ENTITY This is all because of those who made donations! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY This room is just amazing! There are all kinds of fish and other sea creatures in here! $ENTITY Whoever collected all of these fish $ENTITY probably has some great skills! $ENTITY Whoa! Check out that huge one in there with the others!
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY This place is nice, isn't it? This is one of the best spots in $ENTITY !
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY I wonder how these guys can keep breathing under the water like that! What's their secret? $ENTITY All right! I'm gonna watch them until I figure it out!
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY What if those guys are plotting an escape from this water tank? $ENTITY Ha ha! No, I doubt it! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Museum_Fish Hmmm... If I had a huge pool like this at home, $ENTITY I'd be able to swim all I want! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Museum_Fish Unfortunately, the fish I caught isn't in this water tank... Catch and release is my motto! Whenever I catch a fish, I put it back in the water right away!
HA Sp Museum_Fish $ENTITY Don't you feel like it gets cooler when you stare at the water tank like this?... I'm not sweating anymore!
