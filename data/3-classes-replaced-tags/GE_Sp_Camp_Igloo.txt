GE Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY All of this fresh air $ENTITY must really be stirring up my appetite. $ENTITY Everything tastes better $ENTITY when I'm camping! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY is good and all. $ENTITY But when you eat it in front of a campfire, $ENTITY it's suddenly delish!
GE Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY This camping trip has really made me wonder what it'd be like $ENTITY to live in a town like this... Then move here! It's not all great.
GE Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I am, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY SO jealous of you. $ENTITY I mean, you get to live in this amazing town! $ENTITY You should move here! It's kinda overrated.
GE Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I bet living in a town like this $ENTITY is, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY a total dream come true! $ENTITY Then move here! It's no fairy tale.
