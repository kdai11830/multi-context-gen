NPC Grace Fashion It's time for... $ENTITY GRACIE'S $ENTITY FASHION... CHECK! $ENTITY 
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY You had one thing to do: dress according to that theme! Let's see if you managed to pull it off.
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY First, we must step back and view the outfit as a whole. $ENTITY Does it meet my exorbitantly high standards?
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY It comes together well, of course... $ENTITY But it IS a bit vanilla of you to wear all one theme, don't you think? However... 
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY I see what you're trying to do here, honey. That's a bold move, mixing two styles like that!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY No. Considering the current theme, $ENTITY it's just not right.
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY Unfortunately, $ENTITY neither of those styles quite fits with the theme I gave you.
NPC Grace Fashion The good news is you're not a complete lost cause when it comes to fashion fabulosity. But you need to think long and hard about that theme I gave you. Then come back to me with a new look!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY Something about this combination seems off balance. Some items are supposed to have real star power... $ENTITY But your outfit is putting a spotlight on the items that should be playing second fiddle! $ENTITY Don't worry I'm not giving up on you just yet. Focus on balance, and bring me back another outfit!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY When you put dynamic pieces together, they'll just cancel each other out. What's the point in that? $ENTITY So if you must mix moods, $ENTITY you have to find a way to let each individual item tell its own story, $ENTITY honey!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY I can tell you were listening when I gave you that theme, $ENTITY 'cause you completely nailed it, honey!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY And bonus points to you for using one of my original designs. $ENTITY Flattery gets you everywhere!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY Talent like yours deserves to be rewarded, $ENTITY don't you think? So here. Take $ENTITY ! It comes straight from my personal collection. $ENTITY Think of it as my way of encouraging you.
NPC Grace Fashion I don't have all day, $ENTITY but I'm willing to wait awhile so you can go and empty your pockets, honey.
NPC Grace Fashion Phew! $ENTITY It's good to know there's at least one person in town who isn't a complete fashion frump. But it's painfully obvious that my work here isn't done. At least I'm off to a good start!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY Hmmmm... Yet another enlightening fashion check. Verrrry interesting. $ENTITY Each stylish experience here is leading me closer to making a decision about opening a new shop!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY This particular fashion check has just about pushed me off my cliff of indecision and into a... decision.
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY I've done my share of these little fashion checks, $ENTITY and it's given me a lot of time to think... $ENTITY And I think I'm going to open a new boutique right here in town! $ENTITY Now, don't go getting all emotional. $ENTITY I don't have the time to deal with a hysterical fan! $ENTITY I need to start planning my grand opening. You'll be my first customer, honey. $ENTITY Don't tell anyone I said this, $ENTITY but you've been an inspiration to me!
NPC Grace Fashion And now I must be off! $ENTITY But I'll be back again for yet another fashion check, $ENTITY so always dress to impress. $ENTITY I don't want to see you in rags next time we run into each other, if you get my drift. $ENTITY Ciao, honey!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY This outfit is all over the place, honey. You've got all headliners and no opening acts! $ENTITY And what really kills me is the fact that not one of these pieces really fits the theme I gave you!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY You're not doing my designs any favors by wearing them like that. $ENTITY Start over!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to start with this outfit. $ENTITY Go and change everything about it!
NPC Grace Fashion Do you want to hear the brutal truth? $ENTITY This outfit is a hot mess. $ENTITY Too many different styles, honey! $ENTITY Go think about the theme I gave you, and pick a piece to be the focal point. $ENTITY Does that sound so hard?
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY There's no focal pointthat much is obvious. But at least I can see you stuck to the theme. $ENTITY I suppose you did your best, honey. $ENTITY And for that, $ENTITY I'll be kind enough to let you pass for today!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY To congratulate you on your fair- to-middling fashion choices, $ENTITY here is $ENTITY . I designed it myself, so you'd better wear it well. $ENTITY Don't make me regret giving it to you!
NPC Grace Fashion $ENTITY To congratulate you for your fair- to-middling fashion choices, $ENTITY here is $ENTITY .
