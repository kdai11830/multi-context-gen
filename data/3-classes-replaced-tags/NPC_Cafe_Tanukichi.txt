NPC Cafe Tanukichi &#xF; $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi ... do you have any preference when it comes to coffee beans, hm? I have eyes only for the $ENTITY Kilimanjaro... Brewster $ENTITY serves here! $ENTITY Mm, it's so delicious. If you haven't tried it yet, you should really give it a shot, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi I know coffee is coffee, but I prefer mine with $ENTITY a lot $ENTITY of milk, just like a caf au lait. Mm, so refreshing! I try to balance it out by cutting back on the sugar... My doctor shouldn't have any complaints!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi I actually enjoy rather sweet things over the course of a day, but... Lately I've been limiting myself to ... spoonful $ENTITY of sugar! $ENTITY Yes, even I have started to worry about keeping myself strong for years to come. Come now. What would this town do without Nook, hm... .?

NPC Cafe Tanukichi Hello to you,... We seem to run into each other rather often in this little caf, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi Hello to you,... How have you been lately, hm?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi Ah! ... So good to see you, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi Hello there,... It seems this is a popular spot for both of us, yes yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY , you seem to be what I've heard called a "night owl." $ENTITY We both must make sure to keep an eye on our health, though!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi Ah, ... I was thinking you would show up soon. I was just chatting with $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY here!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Please, relax if you'd like... 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi By the way, $ENTITY , how is your house working out for you, hm? $ENTITY If you ever feel the urge for a little remodeling, $ENTITY please do stop by my place! I can help, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi I've been in the sales industry a long time, but only recently I've decided real estate is best. I had fun running a store, but for some reason I just couldn't break out of the usual routine... . That's why right now, I'm using my previous experience but learning something new every day. It's gone a long way toward adding excitement to my life, yes it has!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi By the way, $ENTITY , I do hope you'll be a regular at $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY 's store. I taught both of them everything I know, yes, yes! $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi They still have quite a long way to go and so much to learn, but don't let that cloud your judgment. They have the spirit of business in their blood! I see great things for them very soon, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi They actually came to me before they decided to remodel and open a home-improvement center. That type of business was never part of my business model... It really seems those two are finally using their own ideas to run their business. As their mentor, it makes me feel like they are growing up at last!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi Now the two of them run a grand department store... When I think they used to work as a team on a floor of my department store... I'm flooded with emotion! I have such pride in them, yes, yes!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Ah! That reminds me! $ENTITY Brewster... When I leave, can I have three bags of coffee beans to go?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Coo... They a treat for someone... ?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY I thought I'd take a gift over to the three sisters at the tailor shop! $ENTITY Speaking of which... The middle one, $ENTITY Label $ENTITY , is finally back after a long time of being away from her sisters. It warms my heart! $ENTITY And you can really tell she has great style from her time working in a top-brand boutique. $ENTITY The suit I wear these days is actually a $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY original!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Ah! That reminds me! $ENTITY Brewster... When I leave, can I have two cups of coffee to go?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Coo... They a treat for someone... ?! $ENTITY #x0;
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY I plan on taking them over to the couple who runs Re-Tail! I hear that $ENTITY Cyrus $ENTITY is often up late into the night, retooling furniture at his workbench. $ENTITY Speaking of which... Those two get along so well, it brings a smile to my face. $ENTITY Looking at them makes me think that perhaps getting married might not be so bad. Not that I have any plans for that at the moment, of course, no, no... .
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY I plan on taking them over to the owl siblings in the museum! $ENTITY Taking them coffee in the afternoon would probably help those two stay awake better, but... . $ENTITY on the other hand, there are probably fewer visitors around at that time. I suppose it's probably easier for them to take a little break, hm? $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Yes, yes! $ENTITY I thought I'd bring $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY a little treat! $ $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY You know... I still can't believe sometimes that the little Nooklings are old enough to drink coffee now... . $ENTITY Time sure does fly! $ENTITY O ho ho ho! $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Ah, I suppose I should bring something to $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY from the gardening corner too. He doesn't seem like a coffee drinker though, so... can I order a cup of warm pigeon milk as well?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Say, $ENTITY Brewster... has $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY been in here lately?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi ... Coo. She comes in a bit earlier than you do, $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY , before going off to work... .
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY She's working just as hard as she always has. $ENTITY She's a bit rough around the edges, but you can tell she's very serious about her work. She's been working the late-night shift for a rather long time now. $ENTITY Anyway, next time she comes in, $ENTITY tell her I said hello!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Say, $ENTITY Brewster... a little birdie told me the previous mayor, $ENTITY Tortimer $ENTITY , sometimes drops by the caf.
NPC Cafe Tanukichi ... Coo. He usually stops by in the morning for a cup or two... .. $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY I guess he's still curious about how the town is even though he retired. I can understand that feeling. $ENTITY Even now, I get curious about how $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY are, so I go over to check on them frequently.
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY I see! $ENTITY I'm glad to hear he's doing well! $ENTITY You know, that fellow has loved tropical islands ever since he first became the mayor... . Now he's finally made a home for himself on one. He must really love it there, yes, yes! $ENTITY Someday I'd like to expand into the island-resort realty market as well!
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Say, $ENTITY Brewster... does $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY from the town hall come by here at all?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi ... Coo. But she usually just stops in and gets her coffee to go... .
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY I see... She must be pretty busy each day! $ENTITY Tell you what next time she comes in, $ENTITY would you tell her I'd like to pay for her coffee sometime?
NPC Cafe Tanukichi $ENTITY Coo... .
