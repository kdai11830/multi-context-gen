Patience! $ENTITY I wish you the best of luck, my fishy chum!

Trees bow to you when you equip the $ENTITY axe $ENTITY . Repeatedly tap while facing them. Timber!
NPC Haniwa You can use the $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY to dig holes, bury items, and discover wonderful, new things just waiting to be found! When you want to dig a hole, look for some soft ground and then just press to dig in! The ground will look a little strange if something is buried underneath, so keep a sharp eye out for secrets!
NPC Haniwa Oh, heavens! That wraps up my hearty explanation! $ENTITY So would you like to borrow something now? $ENTITY ( I want to borrow! Item explanation! Some other time.
