HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Heya,... You wanna get in on some serious man talk, $ENTITY ?
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah, ... We were just about to agree that I'm the strongest guy in town!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY What?!... You're crazy! $ENTITY I'm the strongest! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY No way! $ENTITY I am! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY No, I am!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY No, I am!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY Hold on. $ENTITY I'm getting a weird vibe from... Yeah, $ENTITY is totally staring us down... .
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY That look... It's so intense!... Maybe $ENTITY is stronger than either of us! $ENTITY Or both of us put together!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yikes! $ENTITY I think you might be right!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Arghhh! $ENTITY From now on, $ENTITY is only going to see us as minions!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Hey, we have nothing else to do... Wanna play a game?
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY Let's play the anatomy- alphabet game! $ENTITY I'll go first! $ENTITY Abdominals!... Yeah, baby! Kaboom! $ENTITY Your turn, $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha ... B... Biceps! $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY it's $ENTITY 's turn! $ENTITY Name a body part, preferably a muscle type, that starts with $ENTITY "C"! $ENTITY Cerebral cortex! Cartilage! Calf muscle?
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Pulling out the double Cs! $ENTITY Your cerebral cortex must be smart to think up "cerebral cortex"!
HA 3P Ha ... You're quite cunning at this little game of ours... But your answer is a bit too cute for us, so we're not gonna count it! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY That's right, smarty-pants! $ENTITY We're keeping our game nice and dumb!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Cartilage... I don't think cartilage is a specific body part, is it? $ENTITY We're getting into kind of a gray area here... 
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY OK, ... My very official opinion is... who's ever heard of a cartilage ache?... Doesn't count! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY So $ENTITY loses! $ENTITY I know it's tough to swallow. $ENTITY But in sports, the referee's call is final! $ENTITY And there's no instant replay here! Nothing you can do, ... And don't come crying to me with an appeal! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Calf?!... Calf muscles are super strong and flexy! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Darn it! $ENTITY I never would have come up with that!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY But... a calf is also a baby cow, and we're looking for words that are strictly body parts! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Oh! That's right!... We got all excited, but at the end of the day it's a loss for $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yo! Perfect timing, ... Could you judge a little contest between $ENTITY and me?
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY we need an impartial judge like you, ... OK... shall we get started?
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY I'm ready! $ENTITY It's a staring contest! $ENTITY Whoever smiles first, loses! $ENTITY Here we go! $ENTITY Ready! $ENTITY Set!... Go! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha ... Go! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Bwahaha!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY You laughed! $ENTITY OK, ... Who won?... #x0; $ENTITY ! $ENTITY ! It's a tie!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY I win!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Awww! $ENTITY Chalk up a loss for me. $ENTITY Darn it! $ENTITY Nothing that funny happened, $ENTITY but I laughed anyway!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY What do you mean? $ENTITY I was using my superior brainpower to send funny images telepathically! $ENTITY You didn't lose... so much as I won! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY I guess I lost then... But I couldn't help it! $ENTITY Your face is so weird! $ENTITY I just had to laugh! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Is my face really that weird? $ENTITY Now I don't feel like I won at all!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY It's a tie!... Well, that figures!
HA 3P Ha $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY Eternal rivalry is our fate!... We'll have to settle this some other time, I guess!
