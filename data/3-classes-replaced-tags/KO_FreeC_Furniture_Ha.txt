KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I'm actually really impressed by $ENTITY 's skills as a fisherman. $ENTITY I guess he recently caught ... I bet for him it was a piece of cake!
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha Hmmm... Seems kinda strange to see a fancy picture decorating $ENTITY 's place! $ENTITY The $ENTITY is a painting even I'm familiar with... You don't think it's real, do you?
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Never thought $ENTITY would be the kind to have a hobby like raising ornamental plants. $ENTITY I suppose that's all right, though. $ENTITY Everyone's gotta have a hobby, even if it's weird!... GAHAHA!
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Huh... Did you ever think $ENTITY would be the type to listen to $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I suppose it's not totally unlike him, though!... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY gets really loud and rambunctious when he's watching television during the day.... When there's a sports program on, it's more fun to watch HIM than the actual game!... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Mm. $ENTITY said he was pretty impressed by the movements of $ENTITY players. $ENTITY I guess that's here as reference... He's probably trying to copy those moves for himself, don't you think?
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY , huh... .? I can't imagine $ENTITY using something like that, though.
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY , huh... .? $ENTITY That fits $ENTITY 's "early to bed, early to rise" image to a T!
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY , huh... .? That totally seems like ... I mean, could you imagine him in a really tiny bed or something? I can't!... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY said he was gonna try to develop some sorta method for muscle training that uses a sofa... I think his training regimen is a bit too extreme!... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY That reminds me! The other day, $ENTITY taught me an exercise regimen that involves a huge sofa. $ENTITY It was... hmmm.... Well, $ENTITY I guess you'll just have to ask him for the finer details!... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Chairs always seem kinda smooshed after $ENTITY sits in them... Even if it was a brand-spanking-new $ENTITY , it doesn't last long! $ENTITY Then again, $ENTITY he's probably lifting weights even while sitting, so that could make a lot of difference. $ENTITY 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I figured $ENTITY would probably own a bug or two... And look. As I suspected, he's got ... I was right!... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY I picture $ENTITY wearing a tank top and shorts all year long, but... I suppose he still needs to have some storage in his home like the rest of us,... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY OH! Wow, just look at that fancy $ENTITY You don't really think $ENTITY tries to make coffee on his own, do you? ... That worries me a bit.
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY There are so many different gyroids out there, it's hard to figure out which one is the best for yourself... However, I think that $ENTITY fits this room perfectly.
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha I just don't see it... How can you put $ENTITY and $ENTITY together? $ENTITY I wouldn't be surprised if he just uses it as an exercise machine or something,... .
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Well, look what we have here... I'm surprised $ENTITY reads more than I do! $ENTITY I'd imagine he just uses books for muscle building or something like that, though,... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Recently, $ENTITY told me about a dog who can find fossils just by sniffing them out. I makes me wonder... You don't think we know anyone like that, do you?... ?

KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Huh. So this is $ENTITY 's castle! $ENTITY It seems pretty darn comfy, all right!... !
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY There might be things here we really shouldn't touch!... Make sure you check with $ENTITY first... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY People talk a lot about what lets you see people's true natures, but the secret is their rooms. $ENTITY This room is the very essence of ... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY If you compare it to your own place, you'll begin to realize that other people's homes smell different... Oh!... I don't mean they stink or anything like that!... 
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Heh. $ENTITY seems kinda nervous, if you ask me! $ENTITY It's like he thinks we're over here to inspect everything!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY I mean we are, $ENTITY but it's still funny to think that he knows.
KO FreeC Furniture_Ha $ENTITY Since I've been gone, $ENTITY has really improved his house a ton! $ENTITY Well, not that I actually remember how it looked before.... GAHAHA! $ENTITY
