FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Can you believe it's finally $ENTITY Toy Day... I hope $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY gets here soon.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I just can't relax until $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY gets here.... Although it'll be hard to calm down after $ENTITY too.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY When I was little, $ENTITY I'd line up all my dolls on $ENTITY Toy Day... Then we'd wait for presents together!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I've been baking cookies all day. $ENTITY I think $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY should have a tasty snack to help him refuel.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Do you think $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY has lots of brothers and sisters? $ENTITY Or is he an only reindeer?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's snowing outside! $ENTITY It looks like someone popped a big bag of flour over the world. $ENTITY Hee hee!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Did you see? $ENTITY It's snowing outside! $ENTITY Maybe I'll go out and make a snow angel later.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's so beautiful when it snows like this. $ENTITY I just love to watch it piling up outside my windows.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Look at all that snow! $ENTITY It makes me want to curl up with a book about the abominable snowman!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Toy Day... I wonder if someone gave $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY presents when he was young.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I hope you're enjoying $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY as much as I am! $ENTITY This crisp air is so refreshing,... .
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Are you having a good $ENTITY Toy Day... I was just admiring the lights on all the trees. $ENTITY They're so pretty!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Mm, $ENTITY I wonder which picture book I should look at tonight. $ENTITY It's my own little $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY tradition.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's finally $ENTITY Toy Day... Can't you feel the excitement in the air?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I just love playing in the snow! $ENTITY My fingers get cold, $ENTITY but my heart stays warm.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I've been catching snowflakes on my tongue. $ENTITY My record so far is 29 successful attempts in a row.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's really coming down now! $ENTITY You don't think it's turning into a blizzard, $ENTITY do you?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It's like someone's sprinkling sugar on our heads! $ENTITY Quite a bit of sugar, $ENTITY actually.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh my $ENTITY , would you look at the time? $ENTITY It's all right. $ENTITY I'm sure $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY will start passing out gifts soon... 
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I can't believe it's already this late! $ENTITY You don't think $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY left our gifts back at the North Pole, do you?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I heard $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY 's really busy this year. $ENTITY Something about a ribbon shortage. $ENTITY But I'm sure he'll start handing out gifts soon... right? $ENTITY 
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY You look festive in that,... . In fact, you look a little like Santa.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY For a moment, $ENTITY I thought you were Santa! $ENTITY 
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Wearing that, $ENTITY you look a little like Santa! $ENTITY You'll get everyone in town excited if you're not careful.
FU Ev Xmas ... I hope $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY comes by soon. $ENTITY I'm not sure how much longer I can stay awake.
FU Ev Xmas It's long past my bedtime.... Y- $ENTITY you don't think my name is on $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY 's naughty list, $ENTITY do you... .? $ENTITY He should have been here by now!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa?! $ENTITY Sorry about that. $ENTITY I'm very sleepy, $ENTITY and you look a little like him.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY For a moment, I thought you were Santa! $ENTITY It must just be what you're wearing. $ENTITY Sorry about that.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY A present delivered by Santa himself! $ENTITY I should have known better than to doubt the North Pole crew. $ENTITY They always come through for us!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I hope one day I'll be able to bring as much happiness to the world as Santa does.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa really does bring gifts to all the good boys and girls.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I got a present from Santa! $ENTITY It's not exactly what I wanted, $ENTITY but it's the thought that counts.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I got a present from Santa! $ENTITY It's not exactly what I asked for, $ENTITY but that's OK. $ENTITY I'm grateful to receive a gift.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Did you know Santa himself gave me a present? $ENTITY Isn't that great?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY Did you know that $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer is looking for you? $ENTITY I guess it's easy to get separated.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa!... Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer is looking for you. $ENTITY How did he ever lose track of you in that bright-red outfit?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Did you see $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer walking around town? $ENTITY He looks a little flustered. $ENTITY Maybe one of us should go talk to him and see if he needs help!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY I heard that $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer is in town. $ENTITY Have you met him? $ENTITY It isn't really $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY until he gets here!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa? $ENTITY I can't believe you're here in ... But... wait. $ENTITY Why would you be here now? $ENTITY And where's $ENTITY Jingle... He's not normally here until later. $ENTITY I'm not quite sure what's going on.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa?! $ENTITY Did you get my suggestions for improving the aerodynamics of your sleigh?! $ENTITY But... I didn't hear any jet engines. $ENTITY And $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY doesn't normally come to town until later... Hmm...
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa? $ENTITY That can't really be you, $ENTITY can it?! $ENTITY I wasn't expecting to see you, $ENTITY and certainly not without $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY to help! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I'm sure $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY will clear things up when he gets to town later.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thank you so much for the present, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY I promise to take good care of it.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thank you so much for the present, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY I think you're the nicest man in the whole world.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thank you so much for the present! $ENTITY You can count on me to be good next year too.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa, $ENTITY is it really you?! $ENTITY But where's your bag?... -you didn't forget it, $ENTITY did you?!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY Is it really you? $ENTITY But if it is you, $ENTITY where's your bag? $ENTITY Do you remember the last place you had it?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY I can't believe it's really you. $ENTITY Welcome to ... Excuse me, $ENTITY but... .did you forget your bag?

FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY to you! $ENTITY Um, $ENTITY Santa... By any chance, $ENTITY did you bring what I wished for?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day... Santa!... Um, $ENTITY excuse me, $ENTITY but is there anything in your bag for me?
FU Ev Xmas Oh... .I see. $ENTITY Maybe I wasn't as good all year as I thought.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Hooray! $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY Can I open it now? $ENTITY Please, can I?!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Yay! $ENTITY I can't wait to open it!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Hooray! $ENTITY I wonder what it is! $ENTITY Should I shake it first? $ENTITY Or smell it? $ENTITY Oooh, $ENTITY I'm just going to open it right now!
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY It- $ENTITY it's ... Huh. $ENTITY Not that I'm ungrateful or anything! $ENTITY It's very nice.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You! $ENTITY I... This is exactly what I wanted! $ENTITY Thank you, $ENTITY Santa!

FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa, $ENTITY you're amazing! $ENTITY Somehow you knew exactly what I wanted.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Keep up the good work, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY I won't keep you any longer.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Thank you so much, $ENTITY Santa. $ENTITY I'm going to show your present to my friends.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY You're so kind, $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY You remind me a little of my friend, $ENTITY .
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY You're the best, $ENTITY Santa. $ENTITY Now I can go to sleep happy.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh no, $ENTITY where's your bag? $ENTITY Did you check with $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Oh no, $ENTITY is your bag missing?! $ENTITY What did $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer say? $ENTITY Doesn't he usually carry it for you?
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY You're back! $ENTITY Now, where did I put those cookies... Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa, $ENTITY you're still here! $ENTITY Can I help you with anything? $ENTITY Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas $ENTITY Santa! $ENTITY It must be hard to work this late at night, $ENTITY but I'm really glad you haven't left yet! $ENTITY Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas Um, $ENTITY Santa... I was... sort of hoping for a present, $ENTITY and $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY hasn't come by my house yet...
