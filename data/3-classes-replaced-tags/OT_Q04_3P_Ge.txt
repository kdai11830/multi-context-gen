OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY Hey, guys! $ENTITY Is it a party? $ENTITY 
OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY So,... I walked all the way here, so I hope it's something super epic... 
OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY Remember this?... I think I borrowed it from you ages ago, $ENTITY and I wanted to give it back. Sorry I've had it for so long! $ENTITY If it's any consolation, $ENTITY I barely used it at all.

OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY You've been having a hard time getting to sleep lately, right, $ENTITY ? Well, I read in $ENTITY Weekly that if you put an onion in your pillowcase, you'll sleep great!
OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY I feel like putting an onion in my pillowcase will just make my head smell like an onion. $ENTITY Gross! $ENTITY And it doesn't really sound comfy, $ENTITY anyway.
OT Q04 3P_Ge $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY gotta run, $ENTITY but thanks for bringing me here, $ENTITY . $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Hopefully $ENTITY will give you a little something for the effort. $ENTITY I totally would if I were her.
