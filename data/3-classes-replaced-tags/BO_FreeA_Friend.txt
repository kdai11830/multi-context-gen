BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY and... are thick as thieves! $ENTITY I'm not saying they're dishonest or anything... $ENTITY Just that they're really tight!
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY Have you noticed how $ENTITY and... are really good friends? $ENTITY They're like peanut butter and jelly,... !
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY So $ENTITY was asking me $ENTITY whether girls and boys can be friends. Personally, $ENTITY I don't think there's any question about the answer. $ENTITY Of course they can! $ENTITY Just look at $ENTITY and ... They're always hanging out and having fun together. $ENTITY I kinda wish I could join their little friendfest too,... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY The other day, $ENTITY forgot $ENTITY 's name for a second! $ENTITY But $ENTITY said $ENTITY he didn't mind at all! $ENTITY I thought the situation was going to get really awkward, $ENTITY but it ended up being just fine.
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY and... only ever talk about the weather. $ENTITY "Nice weather today!" $ENTITY "It sure is hot today!" $ENTITY "Cold enough for you?" $ENTITY And so on... . $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY I guess it's gonna take a little while $ENTITY before they get past the small-talk phase.
BO FreeA Friend I saw $ENTITY ask... for a sip of ... #x2; $ENTITY #xE; But then $ENTITY wiped the glass off before taking a sip! $ENTITY I think this tells us something about the state of their friendship,... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY and... really don't seem to get along very well. $ENTITY They get all red in the face $ENTITY and angry just from bumping into each other.
BO FreeA Friend I wonder if $ENTITY and ... don't really get along. $ENTITY likes sweet things, $ENTITY but $ENTITY hates them! $ENTITY I can't believe there are people who don't like sweets,... .
BO FreeA Friend Hey, $ENTITY did you know that $ENTITY and $ENTITY get into huge fights whenever they see each other? $ENTITY It sounds sooooo uncomfortable,... !
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY and I $ENTITY are like brothers.... Hmmm. $ENTITY I wonder who's the big brother... . $ENTITY I'm definitely more put together, so it's probably me,... .
BO FreeA Friend Do you talk to ... very often?... I never talk to him! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's not 'cause we're enemies or anything. $ENTITY We're such good friends that I can tell what's he's thinking just by looking at his face,... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY Something terrible has happened,... My good friend $ENTITY ate the candy I was saving for later! $ENTITY I had great plans for that candy... . He had to know that! $ENTITY Words can't describe how upset I am. $ENTITY He'd better get on his knees and beg for forgiveness,... !
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY and I hang out together a lot. $ENTITY We just kinda get together $ENTITY and then zone out. $ENTITY It's important to have friends $ENTITY you can do nothing with,... .
BO FreeA Friend If I were to describe how close $ENTITY and I are... $ENTITY Well, I would share a juice box with him, $ENTITY but not ice cream. $ENTITY Does that make sense? $ENTITY A huh huh huh... So it's kind of an in-between friendship,... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY called me a little kid! $ENTITY That's so unfair! $ENTITY And mean! $ENTITY I'm no little kid! $ENTITY I'm a grown guy $ENTITY with grown-guy responsibilities. $ENTITY Like a loan and laundry and stuff. $ENTITY It's scary when people know exactly what to say to hurt you... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY Are you $ENTITY friends with ... I don't really get along with him, ... It's $ENTITY not that we're in a fight or anything... It's just sorta like how $ENTITY at dinner, veggies aren't my favorite thing to eat. $ENTITY Know what I'm saying?
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY Are you friends with $ENTITY , ... I really like hanging out with her. $ENTITY She listens to my weird ramblings $ENTITY and says I'm $ENTITY "unique." $ENTITY If there was only one $ENTITY left in the whole town, $ENTITY I'd share it with her,... .
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY What do you think of $ENTITY , ... She doesn't get mad at me when I space out, $ENTITY and she's really sweet. $ENTITY She's the kind of girl I wish was my older sister, you know?
BO FreeA Friend Ugh,... I don't really understand $ENTITY . She says she likes $ENTITY . But when I tried to give her some today, $ENTITY she said she actually wanted some $ENTITY . Who says no to ... I don't get her,... .
BO FreeA Friend Do you $ENTITY talk with ... very often? $ENTITY Yeah, I like her. She tells the best jokes!
BO FreeA Friend Hey, listen, $ENTITY do you get along with ... I like her, but we haven't had much of a chance to break the ice. $ENTITY You should let me in on what her favorite food is. $ENTITY Then we'd have something to talk about.
BO FreeA Friend $ENTITY Augh! $ENTITY Help me, ... said $ENTITY my style is all wrong $ENTITY and that she wants to give me a makeover! I don't need her help! $ENTITY I like choosing my own clothes,... !
BO FreeA Friend I used to not get along with $ENTITY . $ENTITY But then she gave me $ENTITY . $ENTITY It was so good! $ENTITY I guess I really misjudged her... .
