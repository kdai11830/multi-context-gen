OT Dream Field $ENTITY You think I'm your BFF? $ENTITY You must be dreaming, $ENTITY !
OT Dream Field Oh, I know you... But something seems a little bit odd about this place.... All right, that does it. $ENTITY No more chocolate before bedtime for me, $ENTITY .
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Oh, it's you, ... What an odd place to meet. $ENTITY Well, as I always say... $ENTITY !
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Who do you think you are?... Oh, sorry! I thought you were someone else. $ENTITY Nice to meet you!
OT Dream Field $ENTITY I can't believe that $ENTITY is the mayor of this town... and ... #x0; lives in a tent!... I don't care WHAT the job pays... That's just not right!
OT Dream Field Now you know I'm not one to gossip... but isn't $ENTITY 's house awfully small? $ENTITY If I were mayor of this town, I'd want a bigger place. $ENTITY Wouldn't you?
OT Dream Field I don't mean to gossip, $ENTITY but have you seen the mayor's place here in $ENTITY ? It's... not exactly spacious. $ENTITY Just between you and me, $ENTITY I think it's a little embarrassing.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Have you seen $ENTITY 's house,... I think it's great! $ENTITY It's big, $ENTITY but not ostentatious. $ENTITY Nicely furnished, $ENTITY but tasteful. $ENTITY That's how a mayor should live.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Guess who lives in the nicest house in this town?... of course. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #x0;'s $ENTITY #x0; the mayor. $ENTITY I bet ... #x0; would jump at the chance to have me over for dinner. $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY who wouldn't?
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Have you noticed how nice $ENTITY I still can't believe how many guest rooms ... #x0; has. $ENTITY I'm so jealous.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY Have you seen $ENTITY 's house? $ENTITY Now that's the kind of place a mayor deserves to live. $ENTITY Take a look at the craftsmanship.... The thoughtfully planned layout. $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY I wish I lived there.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY What do I think of Mayor ... Well.... .I can sum it up pretty easily: $ENTITY . $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE;... But that says more about me than it does about the mayor.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY If you ask me, there are only two times you should live in a tent. $ENTITY When you're building a new house.... or when you've knocked down your new house to build an even bigger one! $ENTITY I'm not sure why $ENTITY lives in one.... Maybe $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; a nature lover!
OT Dream Field Have you already visited $ENTITY 's place?... It's small.... but charming. The kind of place a hardworking $ENTITY can take pride in.
OT Dream Field I just love looking at different houses and thinking of the possibilities. $ENTITY For example, have you seen $ENTITY It's small...but charming. $ENTITY It's amazing what a little creativity can do. $ENTITY You don't need a mansion to live well, $ENTITY .
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Have you met $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; got one of those cool midcentury homes... Just one level, $ENTITY but lots of space. $ENTITY With a big house like that, $ENTITY you can keep a lot of stuff... without feeling like a hoarder!
OT Dream Field You know what I like in a home? ... Two stories. Like $ENTITY 's place. Have you been there? Actually, $ENTITY the more I think about it... all that space could seem lonely. $ENTITY But $ENTITY it wouldn't be so bad if you shared it with a friend... Maybe that's what $ENTITY does.
OT Dream Field Have you already met $ENTITY ? I just saw $ENTITY #x0;... house today. $ENTITY It's a beautiful two-story home with lots of guest rooms... Maybe $ENTITY #x0;' $ENTITY #x0;s $ENTITY #x0;' $ENTITY #x0; invite me over for dinner!
OT Dream Field $ENTITY Have you met $ENTITY ? More importantly.... have you seen $ENTITY #x0;... house? $ENTITY It's amazing! $ENTITY Two stories, plenty of rooms.... It's the kind of place I could see myself settling down in. It's too bad homes like this are SO expensive. You really have to work hard to reach this level.
OT Dream Field $ENTITY If I had to sum up ... I suppose I'd say $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; ... . $ENTITY Yep.... just seems fitting. $ENTITY And I'd probably also throw " $ENTITY " in there. $ENTITY Ha!
