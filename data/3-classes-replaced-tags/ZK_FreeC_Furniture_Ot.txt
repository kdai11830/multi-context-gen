ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot So $ENTITY uses a double bed... She does seem the type to be picky about her sleep, doesn't she, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Not like me of course. I can sleep anywhere. $ENTITY I just need my blanket. And pj's. And special snuggle buddy.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY lives by herself, right?... I wonder why she has ... Oh, right. It's probably for when people like us visit. I guess that makes complete sense.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Listen up, ... When you look at one's chair, you look into one's soul. $ENTITY Let's consider $ENTITY chair... Ah! $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY That seems like her, doesn't it,... ? $ENTITY You...don't know how a chair says all that?... Well, some of us are just a bit better with our chair science.

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Ahh,... So lovely and beautiful... never fails to show $ENTITY just how thoughtful she really is! $ENTITY And to return that favor, a poem. Ahem. $ENTITY "Roses are red, violets are a purplish hue, $ENTITY is cute, $ENTITY but $ENTITY is much cuter."
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot So that's $ENTITY 's $ENTITY I wonder what's inside...... Meh. I bet nothing overly exciting. $ENTITY Although...

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY 
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot ... Does $ENTITY REALLY need to keep stuff like that around? $ENTITY Perhaps she's still got it out in case the stork stops by for a lunch date to check up? $ENTITY You know, I haven't seen him around in ages. $ENTITY I should invite him to tea sometime. Nice guy. You'd like him.
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY there's a fantastic-looking $ENTITY here... It seems like something a grown-up like $ENTITY would gravitate to.... !

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY is in a band or something... $ENTITY She doesn't seem like she has much of a musical side. Maybe it was her mom's or dad's... ?

ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Welcome to $ENTITY 's room! $ENTITY Please make yourself at home,... ! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I guess it's a little weird if I'm the one saying it, but still... .
ZK FreeC Furniture_Ot $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY actually chose all her own furniture. Who'd pass up that opportunity?
