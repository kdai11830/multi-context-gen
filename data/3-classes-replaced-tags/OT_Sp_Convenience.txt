OT Sp Convenience
OT Sp Convenience Convenience stores are dangerous for me because they're open all the time.
OT Sp Convenience They don't sell much here, $ENTITY but at least they're open all the time. ... Wait $ENTITY that sounds like trouble!
OT Sp Convenience $ENTITY This place is great for when you just need to buy something, $ENTITY ANYTHING, $ENTITY and nothing is open. I don't even want to think about how many Bells I've dropped in here... 
OT Sp Convenience $ENTITY It's called a convenience store because it's convenient to just stop by and spend a ton of Bells.
OT Sp Convenience $ENTITY Don't they have convenience stores in your town, ... Why would you come all the way here? $ENTITY Is there an exclusive flavor of $ENTITY that I don't know about?
OT Sp Convenience Hey, $ENTITY I get it.... Sometimes it's the middle of the night and you need a little $ENTITY . $ENTITY And this is the only place you can find it.... I've been there, $ENTITY believe me.
