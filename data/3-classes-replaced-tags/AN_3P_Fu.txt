AN 3P Fu $ENTITY 
AN 3P Fu ... It's amazing how you manage to get up early every day! $ENTITY What's your secret?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Hey! Take it easy! Get a hold of yourself, ... People are gonna think I'm bullying you!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Huh. So roses used to be a much simpler flower?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Huh. So bamboo flowers $ENTITY only blossom once every few decades?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Wait. $ENTITY So... tulips can be poisonous?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Huh. $ENTITY You mean you can EAT pansies if you grow them a certain way?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Interesting... So if you go back far enough, pansies and violets are actually relatives?
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yes! Exactly! $ENTITY Heh heh! $ENTITY I'm so happy! I hardly ever get to talk flowers! $ENTITY , you really like gardening, don't you!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Huh?... Ah ha ha! $ENTITY You got me! $ENTITY Yeah, I'm all about it!... Heh, $ENTITY I decorate my room with flowers and everything!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh, flower arranging! $ENTITY I like that too! $ENTITY 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yeah... And since it's spring, $ENTITY I like to work some cherry blossoms into my arrangements... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh! Very nice! $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY you should try floating a cherry-blossom petal in your favorite tea... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY And... I find that, in summer, water plants are a nice addition... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY And maybe garnish a dessert with some tropical-flower petals!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Right now it's fall... so I like to toss some chestnuts or fallen leaves into my decorations... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Precisely! $ENTITY You could also garnish a dessert dish with a maple leaf... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Right now it's winter... so a curvy branch that hasn't budded yet could be a nice touch... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY Oh! And try making a dessert dish out of snow or ice... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Wow... That is so... girly, $ENTITY but... I love it! $ENTITY I'm gonna try it!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY R-really?... Cool! ... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Huh? There's no secret! $ENTITY I'm no better at it than anyone else! $ENTITY But... I suppose I do make an effort to go to bed early.
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh, that's nothing special! $ENTITY What I need is a quick and easy trick for waking up early... and refreshed! $ENTITY Me... I just don't have the discipline to make myself go to bed early!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Hmm. I don't know... , what do you think? Any ideas?... #x0; GO TO BED EARLY. Power naps! Don't sleep!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yes, exactly! $ENTITY There's no way around it. $ENTITY You can do it, $ENTITY ! If I can do it, $ENTITY anyone can!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Awww! $ENTITY That's it? Really? $ENTITY I'll never make it... I don't have the self-control for that, $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY It's hopeless if you won't try! $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY That might work! $ENTITY If you sleep deeply for short periods, maybe you won't feel groggy in the morning.... I hear that the smell of flowers can relax your body and help you sleep deeply. $ENTITY So try a flower-power nap! $ENTITY Put some $ENTITY on your pillow. See if that works!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY , huh? $ENTITY That might be good... You sure do know a lot about a lot of things! $ENTITY I'm impressed!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh... Well, I'm no expert! $ENTITY I just try lots of new things, ... 
AN 3P Fu ... Be serious! $ENTITY might actually believe what you're saying... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Well, not sleeping does have a certain logic to it. $ENTITY If you're awake long enough, you get a second wind. $ENTITY That's what I need... to always have that second-wind feeling and never be sleepy!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Wh-what... ? $ENTITY , you can't... You're making a huge mistake... , tell her! You can't avoid sleep and not be sleepy! ... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Ah, ah... I- $ENTITY I'm sorry... It won't stop! $ENTITY 
AN 3P Fu ... This isn't a show! Get out of here! $ENTITY Wait!! $ENTITY Let's get one thing clear... I did not make her cry, OK?! ... #x0; $ENTITY Really? Understood. ...
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yes, it's true!... didn't do anything wrong! $ENTITY ,. $ENTITY #x0;
AN 3P Fu We were just talking about chopping onions, and... the tears started up!
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY See? $ENTITY I told ya! $ENTITY There aren't many people like $ENTITY who can cry so easily, you know? $ENTITY I wouldn't even know where to begin, $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu I have a terrible flower allergy... and I always end up like this in $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY She said this happens every year! $ENTITY I bet it's a real hassle! $ENTITY Course, I'm fine, so I don't really understand what she's going through. $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY was talking about how she cut her nails too close, and while I was listening... I started imagining how much it must have hurt her, and I just burst into tears! $ENTITY 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Yeah, can you believe it? $ENTITY I'm the one with the hurty fingers, so I should be the one crying! $ENTITY insisted I tell her all about how I hurt myself... and here we are! $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY it's nice that she's so concerned about me, but still! $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY taught me a massage pressure point, and it hurt so much when I pushed it... I just burst into tears! $ENTITY 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Geez... How come you're fine with ghosts and bugs and stuff, $ENTITY but you can't handle the tiniest bit of pain! $ENTITY I can't tell if you're brave or a baby! $ENTITY !
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Waahaaaaaaa! $ENTITY I'm sorry! ... 
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Uh... Uwuh... I'm embarrassed to be crying over something like this... ,. $ENTITY #x0;
AN 3P Fu $ENTITY Waaaaaah! $ENTITY It's not like I'm crying because I want to, $ENTITY !,. $ENTITY #x0;
