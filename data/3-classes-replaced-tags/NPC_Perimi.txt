NPC Perimi Mm... huh? $ENTITY it's just another customer...... Hi. What's up? $ENTITY Send mail. Save mail. Ask about a present. Actually, never mind.
NPC Perimi Mm... huh? $ENTITY it's just a customer... $ENTITY So, what's up? $ENTITY Send mail. Actually, nothing.
NPC Perimi ... So is there anything else? $ENTITY Come on... Hurry up. $ENTITY Send mail. Save mail. Ask about a present. Nah, I'm good.
NPC Perimi ... So is there anything else? $ENTITY Hurry up already. $ENTITY Send mail. I'm OK for now.
NPC Perimi Oh yeah? $ENTITY Good. Make sure you close the door on your way out.
NPC Perimi Oh, is that all? $ENTITY Well then, I'll save your mail for you.... Haaaa. $ENTITY So much work. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi I see... Where are you sending it to? $ENTITY ( This town. To my future self. Actually, never mind.
NPC Perimi Sorry, but... we're having a hard time catching up with deliveries, so we can't accept new letters now. $ENTITY That's the way it is, so come back some other time.... Come on, Pete, $ENTITY you slacker... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi Since you're from outside $ENTITY you can only send letters to people within this town. All right, $ENTITY can you put the mail you want to send into the red box?
NPC Perimi I'm sorry, but... we're having a hard time $ENTITY catching up with deliveries, so we can't accept new letters now. $ENTITY That's the way it is, so just come back in a little while, all right?... Come on. $ENTITY What's Pete doing...? $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi ... Hmm...... Does this person live in our town? $ENTITY We can't accept letters addressed to people outside $ENTITY , so just take this back. Thanks.
NPC Perimi ... Hmm. $ENTITY All these letters are addressed to people outside $ENTITY ! $ENTITY We can't accept letters addressed to people outside this town, so take them back. $ENTITY Sheesh. No one listens... 
NPC Perimi ... Hmm.... This person doesn't live in our town, right? $ENTITY It's as if I wasn't clear... We can't accept letters to be sent to people outside of $ENTITY , so I'll give this mail back to you. $ENTITY Let's see. You should have other mail that can be sent just fine... Haaaa. This is so tiring. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi Sorry, but... we're having a hard time catching up with our deliveries, so we can't accept all your letters. $ENTITY I'll hold on to the ones we can deliver now and give back the ones we can't. Come back later to send the rest of them, $ENTITY OK? Sound simple enough? $ENTITY C'mon, Pete. $ENTITY What are you doing...? $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi OK, I'll take your mail from you. $ENTITY If you're leaving, $ENTITY make sure you close the door. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY all right. $ENTITY There! $ENTITY Done! $ENTITY I'll keep everything safe, then. $ENTITY Close the door if you're leaving. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi $ENTITY Oh... I actually can't accept letters addressed to $ENTITY right now... This person's mailbox is overflowing with letters, $ENTITY so we can't make any more deliveries to that box. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY If you want to do something about it, $ENTITY talk to $ENTITY directly.
NPC Perimi $ENTITY Oh... . I can't take letters addressed to ... now... These people's mailboxes are full of letters, $ENTITY so we can't deliver anything to them at this time. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY If you want to do something about it,... why don't you talk to both of them?
NPC Perimi $ENTITY Oh... . $ENTITY We're not accepting letters for $ENTITY , $ENTITY or $ENTITY right now... . These people's mailboxes are full and no letters can be delivered at this point. Sad but true. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY If you want to do something about it,... why not talk to them directly?
NPC Perimi I can keep any other letters for you. $ENTITY Thanks for using the post office.... Close the door when you leave... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi All right! Sending to someone in town! $ENTITY Just put the mail you want to send into the red box.
NPC Perimi $ENTITY Huh.... . $ENTITY Did you change your mind?... Ugh. Can't deal with this anymore. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY got it! $ENTITY In that case, I'll open up your special box for letter saving. $ENTITY Move letters in or out using the $ENTITY Touch Screen $ENTITY whenever you want to save something.
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY all right. A letter to your future self, right? $ENTITY Hand it over then.
NPC Perimi Mm... huh? $ENTITY just a customer... $ENTITY What do you need? $ENTITY ( Send mail. Save mail. Um, never mind.
NPC Perimi ... So is there anything else? $ENTITY Hurry up already. $ENTITY ( Send mail. Save mail. I'm OK for now.
NPC Perimi A... nd $ENTITY when should I send this?
NPC Perimi ... Sigh. $ENTITY so much work! $ENTITY I'm sorry... . $ENTITY But when you send a letter to your future self, $ENTITY it's only one letter per person, OK? In your case, it seems you already have one to be delivered on ... of ... right? If I can discard the previous one, $ENTITY you can send a new one... So $ENTITY what do you want to do? $ENTITY I really don't care $ENTITY about this. $ENTITY Yes, send a new one. Actually, never mind.
NPC Perimi Oh, $ENTITY I see. $ENTITY Then I'll return the one you just handed over to me.... There. $ENTITY Just hurry and take it... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi Oh, $ENTITY I see. $ENTITY So as for the new one,... when should I deliver it?
NPC Perimi $ENTITY Huh.... . $ENTITY You changed your mind?... Ugh. Can't deal with this anymore. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi So this should be delivered on ... of ... right? $ENTITY Yup, that's right! Uh-oh. Wrong date!
NPC Perimi ... when should I deliver it?
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY I got it. $ENTITY It will be delivered just as you wanted. Don't worry. $ENTITY Close the door on your way out. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY Got it. $ENTITY Then take your old letter back.
NPC Perimi See you.... Close the door on your way out! $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi ... Do you want me to get the $ENTITY downloadable item $ENTITY being sent for a limited time via the Internet? $ENTITY Download it, please! Maybe later.
NPC Perimi ... Well, first of all you need to free up some space in your pockets. $ENTITY I assumed you already knew that you can't get any items when your pockets are full. $ENTITY C'mon. $ENTITY Gimme a break... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi ... You can't use the downloadable item service right now. Why? $ENTITY Because you have to agree to the latest $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS Service User Agreement $ENTITY . That's obvious. If you'd like to use this service, go to the $ENTITY System Settings $ENTITY and do the following exactly as I say: select $ENTITY Internet Settings $ENTITY Other Information $ENTITY User Agreement... Then, agree with the latest $ENTITY User Agreement... Drop by again when you've gone ahead and done this. $ENTITY I know. I'm confused too. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi I'm sorry... It seems the present isn't being delivered with the $ENTITY access point $ENTITY you're connected to right now. $ENTITY Well, that's how it is. $ENTITY Please come back later when you get this fixed. $ENTITY Maybe try changing your settings... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi I'm sorry, but... it seems the $ENTITY downloadable item $ENTITY service has already ended. Oh well.
NPC Perimi ... Hmm?... You already got the $ENTITY present that's being delivered $ENTITY at this time. The $ENTITY downloadable item $ENTITY is meant to be only one per person, so come back next time. See you and bye-bye.... Close the door on your way out. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi OK, $ENTITY all right. Here's the $ENTITY !
NPC Perimi Well, see you later.... Close the door on your way out. $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi I'm sorry, but... it seems you can't use the service because the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY process failed. $ENTITY Well, that's how it is. $ENTITY Check out the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY when you have a chance. $ENTITY As in when the system is off... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi Sorry... It seems you can't use the service because the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY isn't allowing you to write on it. $ENTITY Anyway, that's where we stand. $ENTITY Can you please verify it once the system's turned off?
NPC Perimi I'm sorry, but... it seems you can't use the service because there is no space available on the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY . $ENTITY Well, that's where we stand. $ENTITY You might want to open some space on the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY before coming back. If you need to take the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY out or put it back in, don't do it while the system's on. Turn it off first. $ENTITY That should be obvious... $ENTITY 
NPC Perimi I'm sorry, but... the communication status from your $ENTITY access point $ENTITY isn't very good. $ENTITY So that's where we stand now. $ENTITY I'd suggest checking your $ENTITY access point $ENTITY before trying again.
