KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I usually don't cook... But $ENTITY it's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY today! $ENTITY I gotta show everyone what I'm capable of in the kitchen! $ENTITY Shouldn't you be cooking, too? $ENTITY I've been thinking of cooking...
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm usually on the eating side... But I guess I can be on the cooking side sometimes! $ENTITY I think as long as the ingredients are good, things should work out just fine, right? $ENTITY To be honest, making something tasty all depends on your luck!... GAHAHA!... Now to make my dish...
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Cooking doesn't go very well unless you're already used to doing it a whole lot, and I'm not!
KO Ev Harvest Man, I've got a lot of dishes planned for today. It shouldn't be overly complicated though, as long as I... .
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hold on! $ENTITY I just remembered I don't have $ENTITY for a recipe, and now I'm stuck. $ENTITY If you can get one for me,... I'll share some other ingredient with you!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Whoa?!... You actually brought me ... Here you go! Sorry. I don't have one.
KO Ev Harvest Man, I absolutely don't have ... and I don't know what to do! $ENTITY Here you go! Sorry. I don't have one.
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yeah, I understand. $ENTITY I guess you don't always have what I need, but it was worth a shot!... Anyway, hate to nag, but if you find $ENTITY , can you bring it to me? $ENTITY I'll even swap ingredients with you! $ENTITY That's a fair deal! $ENTITY !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY GAHAHA!... , $ENTITY you don't have to trade if you don't want to! $ENTITY Though, if you do, $ENTITY you'll get one of my special ingredients! $ENTITY That's a deal you can't pass up!... !
KO Ev Harvest ... Whyyyy! $ENTITY Don't get my hopes up for nothing!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY This isn't what I wanted. $ENTITY What I need right now is $ENTITY !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Thanks! $ENTITY In return, $ENTITY you can have my ... 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY Let's get down to work!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Good, good! $ENTITY Now I can actually finish this recipe! $ENTITY By the way... What are you up to today besides helping me? 'Cause if you're free, I've got some tips!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You're the one helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make the delicious $ENTITY ? $ENTITY If I remember correctly, $ENTITY adding a $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to it will bring out its true flavor!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, wow! $ENTITY You're the one who's been helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make the ... If I remember correctly, $ENTITY it'll taste really good if you put chopped $ENTITY apples $ENTITY in it! $ENTITY Yeah, that's it!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY You're actually going to help $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make the town's ... Try using a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY as a secret ingredient! $ENTITY You'll be surprised on how big a difference it'll make!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY So you're helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make ... In that case, you should totally add some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY to it!... It may sound crazy, but trust me here...
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY You're helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make ... Try adding some $ENTITY butter $ENTITY to it!... It will make your food taste much richer and even smell better!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY So you're helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make the ... If I remember correctly, putting some $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY in that is a good idea... Improves the taste, you see!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Phew... Cooking takes a lot more effort than I remembered! $ENTITY Once things settle, $ENTITY maybe I'll go to the plaza and check things out!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY At first I had no idea how this was going to turn out... But I guess my skills aren't actually that bad!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY My motto when cooking is "quantity over quality." ... But it changed a little today! $ENTITY Putting in a bit of effort to make the food taste better isn't all that bad after all!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you hadn't done me a great service and helped me out, I don't know what I would've done... Man! $ENTITY You saved me!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY You really helped me out today!... Since when did you develop a knack for finding ingredients? $ENTITY Thanks to you, my cooking was a huge success, so good job! $ENTITY I guess the town won't starve after all!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yo! $ENTITY We have a festival today! $ENTITY It's our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everyone in town seems so hectic! $ENTITY But it's for a good reason! $ENTITY It's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY today!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yo! $ENTITY I may not look like it, $ENTITY but I'm really busy, you know? Today... is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY in $ENTITY !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY this year was really fun! Can't wait for next year!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I kinda like the tired feeling I get after a good festival.
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY didn't seem to have any issues this year... Oh, don't worry! $ENTITY I wasn't hoping he would or anything!... I'm just talking to myself. $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest ... thanks to you, my food turned out delicious! $ENTITY Thanks a lot!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks to your help, $ENTITY my food ended up turning out OK! Thanks!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY thanks for your help with my $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY cooking! $ENTITY You got me outta a bind, and I won't forget!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was so much fun this year! $ENTITY I just hope that we have more to pick from next year! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is always a lot of fun! $ENTITY I'm just a tad disappointed that this year's meal was a letdown! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is always a good time! $ENTITY It's just a pity that there wasn't enough of the delicious food! $ENTITY Hey! I've got a big appetite, all right?! $ENTITY Lay off me when I'm hungry!
KO Ev Harvest Maybe I shouldn't say this, $ENTITY but $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking wasn't exactly what I expected. $ENTITY I mean, come on, I'm a big guy. Do I look like I'm anywhere NEAR full from that meal? $ENTITY Hrumph.
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was a lot of fun, as always! $ENTITY But having no main dish was such a huge disappointment! $ENTITY Now I'm gonna have to catch $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY and make HIM the main entre... . $ENTITY Relax.... I'm just kidding!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking $ENTITY was pretty weak this year. $ENTITY Next year, $ENTITY I hope we can enjoy a decent main dish, otherwise I might just waste away to nothing!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ahhh, $ENTITY I'm stuffed!... Man, $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY has some really great cooking skills! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY if we'd had some dessert, that would've been PERFECT!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was pretty good! $ENTITY The food was great, and that just makes me happy! $ENTITY If only we had dessert... Well, $ENTITY I can only ask for so much, $ENTITY right?
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was perfect, don't you think? $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking was amazing, and I even had dessert, $ENTITY so I'm stuffed to the rafters! I'm certain his secret ingredients are what gave his food that extra kick, $ENTITY but I don't know what he used! $ENTITY Professional chefs always seem to have something up their sleeves!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Man, $ENTITY I ate soooo much this year!... Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking was incredibly good this time around! $ENTITY An appetizer, $ENTITY a soup, $ENTITY an entre, $ENTITY and even a dessert!... Everything was so amazingly tasty! $ENTITY Perfect meal! You also helped him, right?... Hey, can you tell me what he used for the secret ingredients? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Well, isn't that a rude thing to just blurt out. $ENTITY Sorry about that! Keep your secrets secret!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was great, as always! $ENTITY I ate so much, including dessert, and now I can't eat anything anymore! $ENTITY Although, $ENTITY I feel like the food wasn't as tasty as in previous years.... It's like something was missing... . $ENTITY Could it be that $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY purposely didn't do his best?! Would he do that?!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ahhh, $ENTITY I'm full! $ENTITY I ate a lot and even had dessert! $ENTITY Now I'm stuffed! $ENTITY That's what the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is all about though, right? $ENTITY This is just AWESOME! $ENTITY By the way, $ENTITY I heard you helped $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY a bit with the cooking.... Hope you were somewhat useful!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I heard this from somebody, but... It seems like fresh $ENTITY oyster $ENTITY goes best with fresh $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY ! Fresh all around! $ENTITY They say it gets rid of the fishy smell and disinfects your food... I heard this somewhere from a pro chef at some point!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Have you ever tried making a $ENTITY mushroom $ENTITY salad... For that... if you add something crispy like an $ENTITY apple $ENTITY , the taste will improve tenfold! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY you gotta take advantage of the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY and eat lots of fancy stuff!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY You ever tried making a $ENTITY fruit salad... If you add an extra something to the fresh $ENTITY fruits $ENTITY , you can create a pretty decent meal! $ENTITY The secret is... honey!... If you add this to your salad, $ENTITY you'll be surprised just how tasty your food will be! For honey, just use a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY . $ENTITY There's nothing to lose, $ENTITY so give it a try!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you go to a restaurant, $ENTITY you see different kinds of salad with fancy names like "blah blah style"... But you just gotta mix everything in with a bit of $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! That's my style for a $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY ! $ENTITY If you add $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY , pretty much anything will taste like a salad. Pretty sneaky, huh?... 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY , sashimi isn't the only way to enjoy eating fish. $ENTITY Put a little bit of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on it... and you'll have a western-style $ENTITY fish salad $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It doesn't take much time, and it tastes pretty good. $ENTITY I like it a lot!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I usually don't eat soup, but... I'll make an exception for $ENTITY mushroom $ENTITY bisque $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Mushrooms themselves have a fairly mild taste, so you should be sure to really season your soup. $ENTITY I like it with some $ENTITY butter $ENTITY , though. It brings out the rich taste,... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I usually don't eat soup, but... something like $ENTITY shellfish chowder $ENTITY is another story entirely! $ENTITY When $ENTITY butter $ENTITY gets mixed with the $ENTITY clam $ENTITY broth, $ENTITY mmm, there's nothing better... It goes well with bread and rice as well. It's my version of a perfect stay-home meal!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I usually don't eat soup, but... fish $ENTITY soup is another story! $ENTITY No need to flavor it too much since you can just use the broth from the $ENTITY fish $ENTITY for that!... But add some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY when you eat it! $ENTITY It'll make things taste better than you'd ever think!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, ... I heard this from somebody, but... did you know that $ENTITY fruit soup $ENTITY can be pretty tasty? $ENTITY Cool down simmered $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY and pour some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY over it... Even those who aren't usually into fruit will become fans instantly!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, ... do you like spicy food, by any chance? $ENTITY I love it! $ENTITY The other day, $ENTITY I went and caught a big lobster just to make some $ENTITY tom yum kung... . $ENTITY It's really a great combination of flavors!... I may be becoming addicted to the taste!... Of course, I also add $ENTITY coconuts $ENTITY to it, $ENTITY mostly to temper the flavor just a little bit. $ENTITY It's perfect, all thanks to the extra coconuts!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you saut $ENTITY sea bass... you can't forget to put some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on it! $ENTITY This is really a tip for all types of food though since everything tastes better when it's sour... In short, just add some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to your $ENTITY fish... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you have $ENTITY pan-fried olive flounder... you can't forget to put a bit of sweet, sweet $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY on it! $ENTITY The tartness adds life to $ENTITY fish... Well, not literally since you're cookin' it, $ENTITY but you get the idea!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you've got $ENTITY pan-fried red snapper... you can't forget to put some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on it! $ENTITY Really, I could eat just about any dish that has that sour taste... Basically, add $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to $ENTITY fish $ENTITY is what I'm tellin' you!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you're making $ENTITY pan-fried dab... you just can't forget to add some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Oh man, I love $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! It's got a bite to it and isn't for everyone $ENTITY just like me! $ENTITY Point is, the tartness of $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY adds life to a good $ENTITY fish $ENTITY ! Remember that bit of advice!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you make $ENTITY seared barred knifejaw... you can't forget to put some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on it! $ENTITY Then again, lemon goes well on pretty much anything... In short, you've got to add some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to $ENTITY fish... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, ... did you know the best way to cook a $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pie is with some honey? $ENTITY It makes me wonder whether it then becomes too sweet or not... Well, perhaps the honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY just brings out the true $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY flavors!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, ... did you know they put honey... in $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pies? $ENTITY It makes me wonder if it doesn't get too sweet by adding something like that... Well, perhaps the honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY brings out the true flavor of the $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, ... when you think of $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pie, don't you assume it has a lot of sugar in it? $ENTITY Actually, $ENTITY when you mix various kinds of $ENTITY fruits $ENTITY , just adding a bit of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice seems to be enough. $ENTITY Apparently, $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY brings out the true sweetness of the $ENTITY fruits... Well, either way you can still taste the sweet flavor, right?... 
KO Ev Harvest Apparently,... people put honey from $ENTITY beehives $ENTITY into $ENTITY coconut tarts... It makes me wonder if maybe that makes it a bit too sweet, though... Well, $ENTITY maybe the honey brings out the true flavor!
KO Ev Harvest Apparently,... people put honey from $ENTITY beehives $ENTITY into $ENTITY banana tarts $ENTITY when they bake 'em! $ENTITY It makes me wonder if you kind of get too much sweetness in the dessert... Well, $ENTITY maybe the honey brings out the true flavor!
KO Ev Harvest The smell of food is starting to spread throughout the town... That means the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is happening now! Yes! $ENTITY What, me?... Well, I was going to focus mostly on the "eating" side of things this year. $ENTITY That's my goal anyway! $ENTITY It's pretty fun to guess the food from the smells!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I've got it! I should go see who's out cooking for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY by running taste tests! $ENTITY I'm not sure if seeing $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY so desperate is a good thing or a bad thing, though.... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is the time of year for cooks to show off their skills in the kitchen! $ENTITY Huh? Me?... Right now, I'm planning to do my best to show off my eating skills at the table! $ENTITY I'd better go see the cooks and find out if they need any help.
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Did you notice?... smells really yummy today, doesn't it? $ENTITY That's because we're celebrating the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... We have a guest chef come cook along with whoever in town wants to cook. Everyone gets a chance!
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY I don't know how it's celebrated in other towns... but we invite a guest chef here for our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY His name is $ENTITY Franklin... He's a really famous cook! $ENTITY He's getting things ready in the plaza all day today, $ENTITY so why don't you go to say hi?... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Umm, $ENTITY what would you call autumn flavors? $ENTITY Mushrooms maybe? $ENTITY I mean, it's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... so I was just curious about what we might eat today! $ENTITY I'm especially excited about the great stuff $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is cooking!... !
KO Ev Harvest Phew, $ENTITY I'm glad the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ended without any problems! $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Whose cooking looked the best? $ENTITY Heh heh... That's a secret! $ENTITY Plus, I've got my own preferences, you know?
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Lots of things happened today at the festival. $ENTITY People lacking ingredients, suddenly forgetting how to flavor the food... But I can say I still thoroughly enjoyed the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... After all, it's a festival! $ENTITY It's still all about having a good time, right?... !
KO Ev Harvest ... Even though the festival is over, I can still smell the food all across town! $ENTITY This is just another benefit of the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was probably a crucial test for $ENTITY Franklin... It seems like he always obtains his ingredients locally, but... That doesn't mean he can always get everything he needs, right? $ENTITY Hopefully he learned something from it and next year he can show off all his skills!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY This year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY didn't feel so filling, you know? $ENTITY Maybe it was supposed to be one of those healthy menus that're getting so popular these days... Next time, I want to eat until I can't feel shame anymore!... 
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The soup that $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY made was delicious with a capital YUM! $ENTITY But to be honest, I was expecting to eat something a bit more solid... Well, I had the chance to eat some great stuff,... so I shouldn't complain too much.... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ahh, $ENTITY we've had all kinds of rare food today, huh?... I'm stuffed! $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is really amazing! He just about cooked an entire full-course meal for us! $ENTITY He was only missing... the dessert? $ENTITY I can do without sweets, so I'm real happy!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY Phew, $ENTITY the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ended without any major problems! $ENTITY By the way, I heard you were helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY cook? $ENTITY Well then, thanks! $ENTITY Everything was delicious! Do that again for next year's festival too!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY How was it? $ENTITY How did you like $ENTITY 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival... The cooks looked like they were having as much fun as those eating, didn't they? $ENTITY Well, come again next year!... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The event has ended, but you can still smell the food everywhere... Just another part of the fun of the yearly $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY out here in ... !
KO Ev Harvest $ENTITY The smell of food will be stuck in whatever clothes you were wearing today at the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY . $ENTITY I bet your clothes smell pretty good then! $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY That'd be the perfect outfit to wear when you tell stories about your time in town here!... !
