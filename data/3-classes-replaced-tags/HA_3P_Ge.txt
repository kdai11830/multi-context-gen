HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Hey, ... was just telling me how to be more popular, $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY I know! $ENTITY Let's get some ideas from $ENTITY too! $ENTITY So tell us, $ENTITY , what do you think it takes for a guy to be handy with the ladies? $ENTITY Huge muscles! Great style! A good heart!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY See? $ENTITY I had it right all along!... Muscles really are important!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Hmm... Muscles can certainly be an attractive feature... But I'm not sure it's the same with muscles-in-progress... like yours. $ENTITY Now fully developed, non-sweaty muscles... That's where it's at! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Sweaty?! $ENTITY In progress?! $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY This muscle right here is bone dry!... Touch it!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Eeeew! $ENTITY Bone dry? $ENTITY More like bony... and perspirationy!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY My muscles really aren't... dry? $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Great style, huh? $ENTITY So the clothes make the man?
HA 3P Ge ... You've got it figured out, don't you! $ENTITY A stylish guy would probably take you on an ideal date: shopping!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Why go shopping? $ENTITY No one ever notices my clothes. All they ever notice is my... thoroughly defined $ENTITY mus $ENTITY cu $ENTITY lar... ty!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, even your muscuwhatever needs some new clothes once in a while, $ENTITY .
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY A good heart?... What... exactly... does that mean?
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, for example, let's say we go to a restaurant. $ENTITY There's a chair seat and a sofa seat. $ENTITY A guy with a good heart would let me have the sofa seat. $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY You're kidding, right? $ENTITY Yeah, you're kidding. $ENTITY First person to the cushy sofa chair wins, right?! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh geez... It's gonna take a LOT of work to make you a gentleman... 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Yo, ... I was just talking to $ENTITY about movies!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY What kind of movies do you like? $ENTITY Action flicks! Romantic comedies! Spy thrillers!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY I am all about action movies, homie! $ENTITY Adrenaline-pumping scenes! $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY Before I know it, I'm on my feet yelling, like, $ENTITY WOOO! ... 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, come on, ... You yell? $ENTITY Doesn't that bother the other people in the theater? $ENTITY You've got to have good manners like me! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY You say that, but if you saw some hunky dude acting like that, you'd love it, $ENTITY right?
HA 3P Ge ... Gasp! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Romantic comedies? $ENTITY Bleeyeck! $ENTITY Do you enjoy not having your heart pound and not getting excited?
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Ugh! $ENTITY Guys $ENTITY are so narrow minded. $ENTITY Romances can have heart-pounding excitement, ... Wow. $ENTITY I'd love to be in one someday!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY I'd like to be in an action movie! $ENTITY Bam! $ENTITY Pew Pew! $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, brother. $ENTITY It's looking more and more like I'll never be in a romantic movie with ... 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Spy thrillers?! $ENTITY I'm not so good at using my brain. $ENTITY .
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY I can't watch thrillers either. $ENTITY They're too intense for me! $ENTITY is so sophisticated and grown up, $ENTITY !
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY You look like you know how to scream pretty good, though. $ENTITY If you were in a spy thriller, $ENTITY you could be the damsel in distress! ... 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY Gee, I better start practicing my screaming! $ENTITY Aiiiiiiiiiggghhhhhh!... Yeeeaaaaaaarghh!... Heeeeeeeeeeeelp! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, man... I shouldn't have encouraged her, ... 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Yo,... Perfect timing!... wants you to see her perform!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY What?!... I never said that! $ENTITY But OK! $ENTITY I'll do it! $ENTITY I'll show you the results of my daily acting regimen! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, man! $ENTITY I am so psyched for this! $ENTITY OK!... Quiet on the set! $ENTITY And... Action! $ENTITY

HA 3P Ge ... This may come as a surprise, but we are twins... separated at birth. $ENTITY Such a cruel fate... For you've had to live without knowing me all these long years! $ENTITY Cruel, cruel fate!
HA 3P Ge ... This may come as a surprise, but we are twins... separated at birth. $ENTITY Such a cruel fate... For you've had to live without knowing me all these long years! $ENTITY Cruel, cruel fate!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Tee hee! ... I am actually the queen of this planet! $ENTITY You $ENTITY must $ENTITY keep $ENTITY my $ENTITY secret, $ENTITY dude!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY I'm the leader of this gang, see? $ENTITY I'm the leader, and you'll do what I say, or there'll be trouble! $ENTITY I do not condone bullying the weak! $ENTITY And if you don't agree with me, $ENTITY I'll give you an $ENTITY attitude adjustment!

HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Thank you, ... Now I know I have enough talent to make it big! $ENTITY Oh, but wait! $ENTITY First I want to be a pop star. $ENTITY Then when I retire from being a pop star, I can become an actress!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY Easy now! Don't overdo it!... And remember us when you're all famous and whatnot!
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Really,... You're saying my acting was so natural, you couldn't tell if it was acting or not, right? $ENTITY That's just the boost I needed! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Aww... That's not what I wanted to hear from you... .
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, my... I get it. $ENTITY My breathtaking performance left you speechless! $ENTITY 
HA 3P Ge $ENTITY Ohhhhh... No need to say anything. $ENTITY I understand.
