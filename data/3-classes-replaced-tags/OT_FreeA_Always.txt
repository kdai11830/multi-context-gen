OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Did you know I used to be an accomplished vocalist, ... I was even on a TV show... called $ENTITY Town Kids Sing and Shout $ENTITY Hour. I don't sing anymore, though... .at least not in public. $ENTITY Why not? Oh, that's too bad.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY You might not have guessed this about me, $ENTITY , $ENTITY but I used to be quite the flamenco dancer! I don't do flamenco much anymore... But I still have the rhythm. $ENTITY Cha... $ENTITY cha... $ENTITY CHA!!! $ENTITY Why don't you dance? I'm sorry.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY If I seemed familiar the first time you met me, $ENTITY it's probably because I used to do a little acting. $ENTITY Oh, they said I'd see my name in lights before long, $ENTITY but I gave it up for the quiet life here in ... Why? Good for you.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , have you ever played mahjong? $ENTITY #xE;I know some people think it's a game only a grandpa could love, $ENTITY but it's actually really fun! Once you learn the strategy, $ENTITY moving the tiles feels like commanding an army. $ENTITY So empowering! $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , have you $ENTITY ever traveled alone? ... Yes, I have! No, never.
OT FreeA Always If you're looking for a good book, you should really pick up $ENTITY . $ENTITY I just love the story. $ENTITY I can't stop rereading it! $ENTITY Do you have a favorite that you can't stop reading? $ENTITY Or do you like discovering new books? $ENTITY &#x1F;( I look for new books! I reread favorites. Reading? LOL!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY is a great place, $ENTITY but there's a whole world out there. $ENTITY Have you ever traveled?... "( Yes, I've traveled far! I've visited a few places. No, never.
OT FreeA Always I hope you don't slurp when you eat spaghetti, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Urgh! $ENTITY It just drives me up the wall!... I would never! Uh, about that...
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Can I tell you a secret,... OK... this is really hard to talk about,... but I'm having a bad hair day. I know it probably looks OK to you, $ENTITY but to me it's a total disaster. $ENTITY Do you ever get that feeling?... Unfortunately, yes. No, my hair is perfect!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Would it surprise you if I said... that I'm pretty proud of my legs? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I don't mean in terms of how they look! I mean... I'm one of the fastest runners in $ENTITY ! $ENTITY And I owe it all to these strong legs. $ENTITY What did you think I was talking about, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always Well, after the show aired, $ENTITY I was recognized everywhere I went. It was fun at first... But then it got really annoying! $ENTITY I couldn't go anywhere without signing a cheesy picture of myself. So $ENTITY I totally reinvented myself.... New hairstyle and everything. $ENTITY Life's been grand ever since! $ENTITY Now I just sing in the shower. $ENTITY And I still sound fabulous!
OT FreeA Always Yeah, it's kind of a sad story. $ENTITY I would have thought you'd be interested in hearing it!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, you can't dance flamenco without any flamenco music,... . I only perform as part of a trio... I require a qualified singer and guitarist... to showcase my dancing. $ENTITY If you ever want to see me perform,... please thoroughly review my 200-page contract for details. $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Of course, for you... I might be willing to make a small exception. $ENTITY Or maybe we could go out dancing together. $ENTITY We can do the $ENTITY Town Slide!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, I don't suppose it would hurt anything to show you one of my moves. $ENTITY See? $ENTITY I told you I was hot stuff. $ENTITY I'm probably the best dancer in ... don't you think?
OT FreeA Always Yeah, it's a shame.... just doesn't have a big enough stage for me, $ENTITY .
OT FreeA Always Well, $ENTITY I used to think it was fun to dress up and pretend to be someone else. $ENTITY But one day I realized that I'm happiest just being myself. $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Especially now that I have so many good friends in ... Like you, ... I know it's a little corny, $ENTITY but you guys are the best. $ENTITY I'm so happy... I don't think I could even act sad!
OT FreeA Always That's why $ENTITY is such a great place to live. $ENTITY I've connected with so many cool friends. $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY you and I aren't quite BFFs yet,... but maybe we'll get there someday.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Yeah... being a celebrity isn't all it's cracked up to be. $ENTITY Who has the time to sign autographs,... ?
OT FreeA Always Of course, $ENTITY it's not an easy game to learn. $ENTITY That's probably why I'm so good at it.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY If you're worried that it will be too hard to learn how to play... you're probably right.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY We should play sometime... once you understand the rules, $ENTITY but before you get too good!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY that's impressive! $ENTITY It can be kind of scary to explore a foreign land all by yourself. But it's also a good way to see the things you want... without worrying about anyone else's schedule. $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY I never knew you had so many interesting stories to tell. $ENTITY We should talk more! $ENTITY !
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY I think you've inspired me, ... I feel like I could pack up right now and travel the world.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY that's understandable. $ENTITY It's easier to travel with your family or friends. But I have to say, $ENTITY it can be an eye-opening experience to visit new places by yourself. $ENTITY I think you should try it sometime, ... You might find you're more adventurous than you think.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Yep, there's nothing like opening a new book for the first time. $ENTITY The crisp pages, $ENTITY that new-book smell... But don't forget to reread the classics every now and then. $ENTITY They always have something to offer. $ENTITY Are you surprised I'm such a big reader? You shouldn't be... I'm, like, the smartest $ENTITY in town $ENTITY !
OT FreeA Always Oh, me too! $ENTITY There's nothing better than curling up with an old favorite on the couch. $ENTITY And if it's something you haven't read in a while, $ENTITY there's so much to rediscover. $ENTITY That reminds me $ENTITY I haven't read The Saga of the $ENTITY and the $ENTITY in ages!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You don't read at ALL? $ENTITY Oh, ... that's so disappointing to hear! $ENTITY Are you sure you don't secretly like reading? $ENTITY It's OK, $ENTITY you know. I think reading's cool, $ENTITY and I'm $ENTITY the coolest.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY That's great! $ENTITY The best time to get out and see the world is while you're still young. See, $ENTITY when you're older, $ENTITY it can be tough. $ENTITY You get used to a certain level of comfort. $ENTITY And when kids are partying all night long in your hostel... it just makes you want to scream! $ENTITY I NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP!... Oh! I mean... that could happen. $ENTITY In theory. $ENTITY I'm sure you'll be fine.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Good for you. Even if you only visit the next town over, $ENTITY it's always a rewarding experience. $ENTITY Of course, the farther away you travel from ... the more exciting things get! $ENTITY You should try to explore as many places as you can while you're young,... . Because when you get older, $ENTITY your priorities change. $ENTITY For example... I'm here today to eat prunes and yell at kids to stay off the lawn. $ENTITY And I'm almost out of prunes.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY , you're missing out! There are so many sights to see, $ENTITY people to meet, $ENTITY and foods to try! $ENTITY Trust me, $ENTITY you haven't lived until you've tried $ENTITY - infused $ENTITY !
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Don't even get me started on loud gum smackers. $ENTITY Or crunchy-chip chewers!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Are you serious? $ENTITY You're one of those infernal spaghetti slurpers?... You guys drive me nuts! $ENTITY Let me give you a quick lesson. $ENTITY First, $ENTITY twirl the spaghetti on your fork. Don't twirl up too much at once. $ENTITY Only twirl an amount you can eat in one bite. And... I guess that's pretty much it.... Hey, I never said it was rocket science!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Heh, $ENTITY so you know exactly how I feel. $ENTITY On days like today, I want to be a rebel and just buzz it all off. $ENTITY Then I can throw away my combs and brushes and products and save myself an hour each morning. Ah, $ENTITY but when I have a good hair day... it's all worth it, $ENTITY don't you think? $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always Of course, $ENTITY the style in $ENTITY is so casual. $ENTITY Everyone's got their own look, $ENTITY and they rock it! $ENTITY So it's best not to let a few funky follicles ruin your day, $ENTITY my little tantrum notwithstanding!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Of course, it's best not to let a few funky follicles ruin your day. $ENTITY I just think of the old saying: "Good hair... bad hair... I'm the one with the activator and straight iron!"
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well... it's good to be confident! $ENTITY Just remember, $ENTITY looks aren't everything.... You need smarts to get ahead!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Maybe I shouldn't brag, $ENTITY but I've been named "Fastest $ENTITY in $ENTITY " for 3 years running.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Let me know if you ever need any running advice $ENTITY from one speedy girl to another. $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY ?
OT FreeA Always Brr! $ENTITY It's so cold out!... At least we're getting a little snow to go with these freezing temperatures. $ENTITY And you know what that means, don't you, ... It's time to make a snowman! $ENTITY You don't know how to build one? $ENTITY Well, it's easy. $ENTITY Just start rolling up the snow, $ENTITY little by little. $ENTITY Be careful around the water... and make one snowball at a time. $ENTITY When they're the right size, $ENTITY stack 'em up! I can't wait to see what kind of snowman you'll build, $ENTITY !
OT FreeA Always You know what's really fun about this wild weather,... ? $ENTITY You can build a snowman! $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY a snowman is more than just two snowballs stacked on top of each other, $ENTITY you know. $ENTITY You can build a baby snowman, $ENTITY a kid-sized snowman $ENTITY , or even a giant papa snowman! $ENTITY I wonder what would happen if you made an entire snowfamily.... ?
OT FreeA Always You know, $ENTITY every time I eat ... I think of my childhood. $ENTITY Nobody makes it like my mom!... Are there any foods that make you nostalgic,... ( Of course! No, not really.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY That's so good to hear! $ENTITY I worry about kids who eat nothing but frozen dinners. $ENTITY So what was your favorite? $ENTITY A classic like ... Or a new twist on $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Either way $ENTITY , hang on to that recipe! $ENTITY It's something you can share with your own kids when the time comes.
OT FreeA Always Oh, $ENTITY that's surprising! $ENTITY Taste and smell usually have a way of bringing up old memories. I'd offer to make a traditional $ENTITY meal for you sometime... But I'm not your mother! $ENTITY Or your father, $ENTITY for that matter! $ENTITY Dads can cook too, $ENTITY you know.
OT FreeA Always I've been wondering, $ENTITY : Are you really good at ... #x0;( How did you know? No, not at all.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Haven't I told you before? $ENTITY I'm a little bit psychic. $ENTITY In all seriousness, you just have the look of someone who has some experience with $ENTITY . $ENTITY Take it as a compliment, $ENTITY ! You seem like a sporting $ENTITY l.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, you should think about taking it up. $ENTITY I know the uniform would look good on you.
OT FreeA Always So tell me,... , $ENTITY what kind of clothes do you wear when you're relaxing at home?... Whatever's comfy. I keep it stylish.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Me too. $ENTITY I just don't feel like putting on fancy clothes when I'm going to sit around and eat popcorn. You won't tell anyone, $ENTITY will you? $ENTITY I have a reputation to maintain!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY Who are you trying to impress? $ENTITY Don't get me wrong $ENTITY sweatpants are not meant to be seen in public. $ENTITY But they're fine for a lazy day in.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY 
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY This might seem like a weird question, ... but do you ever wear makeup? $ENTITY Yes, once in a while. No, never.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY , $ENTITY from one girl to another: $ENTITY do you usually wear makeup? $ENTITY ?( Yes, I do. Not usually.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY there's nothing wrong with that. $ENTITY Boys are wearing makeup. $ENTITY deal with it! $ENTITY Just don't put too much foundation and self tanner on, $ENTITY or you'll look like a news anchor.
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Well, you've got really nice skin and a good complexion. $ENTITY I'm jealous! $ENTITY Of course, $ENTITY more and more men are wearing makeup these days.... Nothing wrong with trying to look good!
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Me too. $ENTITY It's nice to add a little sparkle or some color when you're feeling flat. $ENTITY But nothing radiates beauty like a pretty smile and kind eyes. $ENTITY Don't you agree, $ENTITY ?
OT FreeA Always $ENTITY Wow, you look great... and so natural! $ENTITY I'm jealous of your complexion. $ENTITY You'll have to share your skin-care routine with me sometime. $ENTITY OK,... ?
