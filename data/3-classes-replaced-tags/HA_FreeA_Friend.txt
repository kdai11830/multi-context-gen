HA FreeA Friend Friendship between guys sometimes becomes a rivalry, doesn't it? $ENTITY It's, like, that I-have-to-be-the-best mentality drives some guys to compete! $ENTITY For example, $ENTITY and $ENTITY seem like they have that sort of thing going on. $ENTITY What the heck are they always arguing about, anyway?
HA FreeA Friend Friendship between women is different than friendship between guys, don't you think? $ENTITY It seems like the ladies really enjoy talking about relationships. $ENTITY and $ENTITY are always talking about stuff like that. $ENTITY Come to think of it, those two probably have some good things to say about that stuff. $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Friend Hey, did you notice?... It seems like $ENTITY and $ENTITY are always cooking something up! $ENTITY They look more like conspirators than pals, if you know what I mean! ... They could be planning a major prank! $ENTITY I better keep an eye on 'em.
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Man, I need a jogging buddy! $ENTITY I need someone who can take off for a run at the drop of a hat! $ENTITY Someone I can just be myself with! $ENTITY Like $ENTITY and $ENTITY ! That's exactly what I need! $ENTITY Ha ha! I can't imagine the two of them jogging together, though! $ENTITY 
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY and $ENTITY seem to have such a formal relationship. $ENTITY To really get to know someone, sometimes you really have to go toe-to-toe in an argument. $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY But if it came to fisticuffs, $ENTITY they'd probably level this town!
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Just a guy and a girl hanging out together is enough to get rumors started, isn't it? But I think I might have read too much into $ENTITY hanging out with $ENTITY . $ENTITY I saw them the other day, and I was like, "How are the lovebirds doing?" $ENTITY They laughed at me and said I just don't get it. $ENTITY Darn! I'm so awkward sometimes, $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY and $ENTITY argue all the time! $ENTITY I guess they just have a personality clash... But, hey! A team is more fun with different kinds of people!
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Yikes! $ENTITY and $ENTITY went at it again! $ENTITY I've never seen such an intense verbal sparring match between two women before! $ENTITY No matter how hard I train, I'll never be able to compete at that level, $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Friend I saw $ENTITY and $ENTITY having quite an animated discussion a while back. Some guys just don't know how to argue with women, ... These days you have to train your vocabulary muscles as well as your bod!
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with ... He's my good friend! He's a guy with a real backbone, so I like to train with him! $ENTITY But he's also a serious rival, and I can't let him get the best of me! $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY There is one person in this town I have to take my hat off to! Other than you, I mean... Can you guess who it is?... Beeeeep! $ENTITY Time's up! $ENTITY The answer is ... I have nothing but praise for that dude. $ENTITY ?
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Hey, was $ENTITY talking about me? $ENTITY We had a big fight the other day. It was over something really stupid too. $ENTITY Neither of us would back down! We're both so stubborn. $ENTITY Ha ha! Sorry for complaining! The two of us are pretty tight. I'm sure we'll iron it out, ... 
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Yeah, he's a good bro. I feel like he's somebody I can talk about silly stuff with, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Haha! You should talk to him more! $ENTITY 
HA FreeA Friend Um... are you close with $ENTITY , ... I'm on OK terms... But I think we could probably be better pals. $ENTITY I mean, he's kind of an interesting guy, right? $ENTITY 
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY is awful, isn't he?! $ENTITY He told me working out was a waste of time! $ENTITY Grrrrrr! What does he know? He's so immature! $ENTITY So now I'm gonna train my butt off!... Then I'm gonna hurdle right over his head and prove how skilled I am!
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Hey! Could you tell me how I should approach $ENTITY socially? $ENTITY I don't know if we just move along at different paces or have different world views or what... . $ENTITY But no matter what I say to him, his response is always cool. Maybe we just aren't a good match... .
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with ... I talk to her a lot, and it seems like we never have any weirdness between us! $ENTITY I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but I think we're becoming really close friends! $ENTITY I bet if you talk to her, you'd be close with her too!
HA FreeA Friend Hey, are you tight with $ENTITY ? 'Cause I feel like I am. $ENTITY When the two of us get to talking, we just can't stop! $ENTITY I'm not a chatterbox, am I? $ENTITY Naw, I'm pretty sure it's a two-way conversation, $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Hey... Has $ENTITY said anything to you recently, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY A while back, the two of us were just talking, and then all of a sudden we were fighting! Hmm... I don't know what to do. $ENTITY Well, we both tend to forget about stuff like that the next day, so maybe I shouldn't worry about it.
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Are you and $ENTITY on pretty good terms? $ENTITY I should talk to her more. $ENTITY I feel like she's somebody I would get along with! $ENTITY If she understands my muscles, we'll be golden!
HA FreeA Friend Recently I've been thinking about the best way to talk to $ENTITY We'll say hi to each other now and then, but I can never say anything to get the conversation going. $ENTITY Hmm... Maybe I'll ask her to try $ENTITY with me! $ENTITY 
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY What kind of person is $ENTITY I got in an argument with her a little while ago, and now I understand her even less. $ENTITY When I get into situations like this, I always end up working out and forgetting about everything else!
HA FreeA Friend $ENTITY Hmm... I wonder if $ENTITY likes me. $ENTITY When I go jogging, she yells stuff like, "You can do it!" $ENTITY It's kinda weird because she used to be so cold to me! $ENTITY She's full of surprises. $ENTITY The other day when I was out running, she actually sprinted past me!
