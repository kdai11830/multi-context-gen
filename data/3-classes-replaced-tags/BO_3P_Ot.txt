BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hey,... You can ask $ENTITY anything, $ENTITY and she'll ALWAYS know the answer, $ENTITY .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Pardon? $ENTITY What makes you say that,... I'll certainly TRY to answer your questions... What would you like to know, ... Your favorite food. Your life's ambition. Your views on love. How old are you?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY What a great question! $ENTITY This is so exciting! $ENTITY !
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY My favorite food? $ENTITY That's your big question? $ENTITY All right. $ENTITY If I had to say... I prefer sophisticated food.
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Sophisticated food? $ENTITY What does that even mean?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Consider the $ENTITY , for example. $ENTITY The color, $ENTITY the luster, $ENTITY the shape... They look just lovely when served at a fancy dinner party!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY So you're just supposed to admire them?... ... $ENTITY That must be why nobody invites me to fancy dinner parties.
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Ooh yeah! $ENTITY I wanna know!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY My life's ambition?... Why, $ENTITY I've already succeeded at it. $ENTITY Being THE elegant and discerning resident of a town like ... That was my dream... . $ENTITY I suppose I'll be expected to find another lofty goal now,... .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY That's your life's ambition?! $ENTITY With all your talent, $ENTITY you could have been a baker! $ENTITY Or a chocolatier! $ENTITY Or a cotton-candy vendor!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh, ... You'll understand when you're older, $ENTITY my dear.
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Her views on love? $ENTITY What? Why?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY What a delightful question! $ENTITY I like to compare love to a string of pearls... They're beautiful, $ENTITY but do I really want to wear them every day? $ENTITY Or do I save them for fancy parties, where I need to impress everyone and make them jealous... $ENTITY Although, $ENTITY I haven't worn pearls in years, $ENTITY .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY But $ENTITY I've NEVER worn pearls! $ENTITY Not even once, $ENTITY !
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Stick to chocolate and comic books. $ENTITY You're too young for love anyway.
BO 3P Ot Uh-oh... That's not a good question to ask,... .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY It's all right, ... I did say I would try to answer anything, ... I have walked this earth... for 250 years!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh ho ho ho! $ENTITY Just kidding, ... I'll never tell you the truth... $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY , $ENTITY you smell really nice...
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmmm? $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY you noticed my new perfume? $ENTITY Isn't that sweet! $ENTITY You've got a good nose,... 
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY A huh huh huh... Uhh, $ENTITY thanks.... You can smell me too, $ENTITY if you want,... !
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Smell YOU? $ENTITY But... now I'm curious. $ENTITY I must know your fragrance. $ENTITY Yes. $ENTITY #x0; I detect notes of vanilla, $ENTITY oak, $ENTITY raspberry, $ENTITY and... what is THAT?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ot ... Spaghetti sauce?!
BO 3P Ot ... Nacho cheese?!
BO 3P Ot ... Barbecue sauce?!
BO 3P Ot ... Pickled fish?!
BO 3P Ot ... Potato chips?!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Ding ding ding! $ENTITY That's correct! $ENTITY You're so good at guessing stuff,... .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Ahhhh... That particular scent is very "you," $ENTITY .
BO 3P Ot ... What do you think would make a good Mother's Day present?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Wh- $ENTITY why are you asking me that?... 
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY ummm. $ENTITY You're sort of the closest thing in town to a mom... .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY So $ENTITY I'm old enough to be your mother?!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Ack! $ENTITY N- $ENTITY no!... That wasn't what I was trying to say!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY How about an aromatherapy candle? $ENTITY One with a lovely, $ENTITY relaxing smell that fills the room, $ENTITY .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY A candle that smells nice? $ENTITY Ooh! $ENTITY And you can use the candle to make tiny little s'mores! $ENTITY It's perfect! $ENTITY Like a Mother's Day camping trip, $ENTITY but without the tent or wild animals!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY I take it your mother is a food fanatic, like you? $ENTITY Why don't you just take her out to a nice restaurant $ENTITY or buffet?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY How about olive-oil soap? $ENTITY It smells good $ENTITY and can make your skin feel soft,... .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oooh! $ENTITY I love olive oil!... So $ENTITY if you just eat the soap, $ENTITY does it make your skin even softer?
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY No, $ENTITY no, $ENTITY no! $ENTITY You can't EAT any kind of soap! $ENTITY You'd get terribly sick!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Aww, man. $ENTITY That's really confusing! $ENTITY In that case, $ENTITY maybe I'll just give her an entire olive's worth of olive oil!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well... we are talking about YOUR mother,... Something to eat or drink might be the perfect gift, $ENTITY .
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmmm.... How about a handbag?... Mothers often have to carry a lot of supplies with them.
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Ooh, $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY A pretty handbag!... With candy in it?! $ENTITY If I put candy in it, $ENTITY she'll think about me every time she reaches inside! $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY A pretty handbag that's FULL of delicious candy!
BO 3P Ot $ENTITY Do you really think she'd appreciate that?... Then again, $ENTITY she is your mother.... Better be sure to get her a great BIG handbag,... .
