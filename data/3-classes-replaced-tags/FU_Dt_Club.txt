FU Dt Club $ENTITY I was a little apprehensive about coming to a show like this. $ENTITY But now that I'm here, $ENTITY I'm feeling great! $ENTITY Listening to music at a concert is much more fun than just playing a recording.
FU Dt Club $ENTITY I get so excited that I get nervous! $ENTITY It's like being on the first big hill of a roller coaster. $ENTITY 
FU Dt Club $ENTITY Music like this speaks to my soul!
FU Dt Club $ENTITY Gah! $ENTITY No matter how often I come here, $ENTITY the beat still seems really loud sometimes!
FU Dt Club $ENTITY Are you getting into the swing of things? $ENTITY The groove? The beat? $ENTITY I am!
FU Dt Club $ENTITY Dancing here helps me to blow off some steam and get some exercise!
FU Dt Club $ENTITY I feel so rejuvenated! $ENTITY Dancing here really helps to clear my mind.
FU Dt Club $ENTITY I wish I was more musical! $ENTITY I'd love to create music that makes people want to dance.
FU Dt Club $ENTITY So you caught me getting a little carried away out there on the dance floor. $ENTITY Eh heh.
