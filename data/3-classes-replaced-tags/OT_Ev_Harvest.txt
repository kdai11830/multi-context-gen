OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Aren't you excited for today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , ... I've been sampling my own cooking all day,... and I can assure you it's the best in $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , $ENTITY today is the big $ENTITY Harvest Festival... I'm going to be cooking up a storm in here.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY As you can see, $ENTITY I've got a lot more cooking to do. $ENTITY And no, $ENTITY you can't taste anything until it's all finished.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY I sauted what I was supposed to simmer and simmered what I was supposed to saut!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Speaking of cooking... I feel like one of my dishes is missing a certain something. $ENTITY Maybe you can help me out! $ENTITY I need ... I'd just melt if you brought me some.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY , $ENTITY did you bring me the $ENTITY I need to finish cooking? $ENTITY Yes! Here you go. No, I don't have any.
OT Ev Harvest It's hard to cook something like $ENTITY without any $ENTITY ! Little help? $ENTITY Heretake this! I don't have any.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY that's too bad. $ENTITY I could really use some $ENTITY And I bet I have ingredients you could use.
OT Ev Harvest Oh... well, $ENTITY there's still time to track some down. $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is all about sharing, $ENTITY you know. Plus, $ENTITY I have so many ingredients to share with you! $ENTITY If we work together, $ENTITY we can make a real feast.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY It's not nice to tease like that,... . $ENTITY You got my hopes up!
OT Ev Harvest Well, $ENTITY this is awkward. $ENTITY Because what I actually needed was $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY perfect. $ENTITY This is just what I needed. ... Here. $ENTITY I've got something for you... It's $ENTITY !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY I had better get back to my cooking now. $ENTITY That pan isn't gonna deglaze itself.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks,... Now, $ENTITY if you're going to be doing some cooking of your own,... here's a little tip... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you're making a dish like $ENTITY , $ENTITY try adding some... lemon... for extra zest!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY For yummy ... add some chopped $ENTITY apple $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's my secret ingredient.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Try adding a few teaspoons of honey to the recipe when you're making $ENTITY . $ENTITY Not sure where to find honey? $ENTITY Try looking in a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY . $ENTITY Just make sure the bees are long gone first!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY The secret ingredient in my award- winning $ENTITY recipe is... #x0; $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY When cooking, $ENTITY butter $ENTITY makes everything better. $ENTITY Especially $ENTITY !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Be sure to use real $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY milk in your $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's the only way to get that rich taste.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Once things are a bit calmer, $ENTITY I think I'll head to the event plaza and see how the festival is going.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY how'd you like being a chef today,... Doesn't the food taste better when you can appreciate how much hard work went into making it?
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everybody should learn to cook a few classic dishes. $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY basics like $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Did you taste my cooking?... Everything was so... o good, $ENTITY thanks to your help.... !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY thanks to your special ingredient, $ENTITY my dishes were delish.... , $ENTITY I want more!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY here in $ENTITY , $ENTITY so I'm busy preparing a feast.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I've heard hunger is the best sauce. $ENTITY And I sure hope that's true, $ENTITY because my food won't be ready for, like, 30 hours.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY This is my chance to show everyone in $ENTITY that I can cook without using a microwave.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY It's more fulfilling to cook for others than it is to cook for yourself. Plus, $ENTITY you can usually get out of doing dishes. $ENTITY !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY , $ENTITY I guess everyone really liked my cooking. $ENTITY There aren't any leftovers!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY , $ENTITY I've been standing in front of a hot stove all day. $ENTITY I hope the end result was worth it... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks again for your help today,... . $ENTITY Your secret ingredient was the key!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh,... I'm so glad you stopped by with that special ingredient today. $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I'm not sure what I would have done without it. $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY fine. $ENTITY I would have topped everything with sugar.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Nice work,... Looks like you and $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY make a great team in the kitchen. $ENTITY I'm sure he could teach me a thing or two about classic harvest dishes... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I have to admit $ENTITY I'm a little disappointed with this year's feast.... Something was... missing. $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I'm not being sarcastic. $ENTITY This is just the way I talk!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY So $ENTITY the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is all about sharing. $ENTITY Everyone in $ENTITY pitches in. $ENTITY But the whole thing falls apart when SOMEONE doesn't feel like contributing. I won't name names... but it was YOU! $ENTITY "You" is a pronoun, so technically I haven't named names. $ENTITY 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is a great chef, $ENTITY but he can't feed the whole town by himself, $ENTITY you know. $ENTITY A few more dishes would have been nice. $ENTITY Ah well, $ENTITY next year.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everything I tasted today was good. $ENTITY I just wish there had been more to try... , $ENTITY it seems like $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY could have used a little more help in the kitchen.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is the real star of the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , $ENTITY but every star needs a solid supporting cast. $ENTITY I'm just saying... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I have to say, $ENTITY the food at the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY tastes great, $ENTITY but it seems a bit less filling than usual... A little heavy on the light stuff, $ENTITY and a little light on the heavy stuff, $ENTITY if you know what I mean.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Quite a feast this year. $ENTITY Quite a feast indeed. $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY really went all out. $ENTITY If I could offer one TINY suggestion:... a little something sweet at the end of the meal is always nice.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh my goodness... My compliments to the chef. $ENTITY You and $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY have outdone yourselves. $ENTITY That was one of the best $ENTITY Harvest Festivals $ENTITY I can remember. $ENTITY All I need now is a nibble of dessert. On second thought... Oh no... I've had too much already. ... excuse me!
OT Ev Harvest I may have once said that I'm the greatest chef in $ENTITY , $ENTITY or the world, $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY or whatever... But now I have to take it back. $ENTITY The feast you and $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY prepared this year was phenomenal! $ENTITY The sublime flavors, $ENTITY the elegant interplay of texture and mouthfeel... $ENTITY I must have the recipes. $ENTITY I $ENTITY MUST!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ahhh, what a meal! $ENTITY From the appetizers to the main course... even dessert... everything was delicious. Of course $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is a master chef, $ENTITY but he couldn't have done this without your help,... . $ENTITY And what WAS that secret ingredient? $ENTITY Truffle oil? $ENTITY Saffron? $ENTITY Sea urchin? $ENTITY I must know! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY has done it again. $ENTITY That was one of the best meals I've ever had!... so delicious. $ENTITY And you helped with the cooking, $ENTITY right, ... I bet the dessert was your idea. $ENTITY Yum!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Wasn't this year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY the best? $ENTITY , $ENTITY I loved everything about it. $ENTITY And there were so many tasty dishes... plus dessert. $ENTITY #xE;I know it's not polite to say this, $ENTITY but I'm stuffed! $ENTITY On that note... they say that Harvest food makes you sleepy, $ENTITY and they weren't kidding. $ENTITY Good night!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY A lot of people are intimidated by $ENTITY oysters $ENTITY , $ENTITY which is a shame, $ENTITY because they're delicious and healthy. $ENTITY So here's a tip that will make them a little more approachable: $ENTITY add fresh $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice! $ENTITY Especially when you're making $ENTITY oyster salad $ENTITY . A splash of lemon is just what that dish needs.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everyone loves a good $ENTITY mushroom salad... But here's a fun idea to shake things up... Try adding some chopped $ENTITY apple $ENTITY to the mix! $ENTITY The sweetness and crunchy texture are always a big hit. ... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you think regular $ENTITY fruit salads $ENTITY are boring, $ENTITY here's an idea to spice things up. $ENTITY Drizzle a little honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY into the mix with your dressing! $ENTITY It's a nice way to add depth of flavor and sweetness without overpowering the dish.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY You can't make a $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY by just tossing random lettuces and veggies in a bowl. $ENTITY You have to have a plan, $ENTITY and you have to use the right dressing $ENTITY too! $ENTITY I like $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY -based dressings the best. $ENTITY They're tangy and tart, $ENTITY and they punch up your flavor profile!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY When made right, $ENTITY there's nothing like a fresh $ENTITY fish salad $ENTITY . $ENTITY But there's an art to preparing one. $ENTITY Of course you want to start with the freshest $ENTITY fish $ENTITY you can find. $ENTITY And a sharp vinegar dressing is key. $ENTITY But the real secret is $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice. $ENTITY Add a generous splash to get that classic zing!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY , $ENTITY if you've never tried $ENTITY mushroom bisque $ENTITY , $ENTITY you're really missing out! Of course the mushrooms offer a lot of savory goodness. $ENTITY But a little $ENTITY butter $ENTITY makes them even better. $ENTITY Mmm... Melting butter makes ME melt. $ENTITY Yum!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you're in the mood for a really rich meal to savor, $ENTITY shellfish chowder $ENTITY always hits the spot. $ENTITY But if you only use cream, $ENTITY your chowder won't be as rich as it could be. $ENTITY The trick is to add plenty of $ENTITY butter... But... keep it to yourself. $ENTITY Some people are scared of a little butter.
OT Ev Harvest If you make $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY without $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , $ENTITY you're doing it wrong. $ENTITY Of course some people say anything goes in a $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY , $ENTITY but I just don't buy it. $ENTITY You need fresh fish, $ENTITY you need savory broth, $ENTITY and you definitely need that lemon juice!
OT Ev Harvest Some people think a $ENTITY fruit soup $ENTITY should only contain sweet fruit. $ENTITY But they haven't tried MY fruit soup. $ENTITY The secret ingredient is $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice. $ENTITY You need that citrus bite to balance out all the sweet flavors. Trust me, $ENTITY you appreciate the sweetness more when it's balanced with zesty lemon!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you want an exotic dish that will really impress your guests, $ENTITY you should make $ENTITY tom yum kung $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It's a spicy soup with delicately balanced flavors and buttery lobster. $ENTITY And if you really want to put the "Yum!" in your $ENTITY tom yum kung... the key is $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY milk. Oh, $ENTITY if you're having trouble sourcing lobster, $ENTITY you might try a more hands-on approach... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you're cooking seafood, $ENTITY you need to use a light touch in order to avoid overpowering the fish. Like $ENTITY sauted sea bass... for example. $ENTITY It's good to use butter in the pan,... but you should also add $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY . Yep... one little drizzle adds a ton of sizzle. $ENTITY Just trust me... It's tastier than that rhyme.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I know it sounds pretty exotic, $ENTITY but $ENTITY pan-fried olive flounder $ENTITY is actually a simple dish. $ENTITY It's basically crispy fried fish, $ENTITY which is clearly delicious.... And it's great with $ENTITY vinegar... like fish-and-chips. Trust me, $ENTITY pronouncing the name is harder than making the dish. $ENTITY Try it! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Pan-fried red snapper $ENTITY sounds simple, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Just throw a snapper in the pan and fry it! $ENTITY But if you want to do it right, $ENTITY you should season the fish with either $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY . $ENTITY Which one is better? $ENTITY You'll just have to try them both and see for yourself, $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY if you like fish-and-chips, $ENTITY you'll love $ENTITY pan-fried dab... It's a little fancier, $ENTITY and it doesn't come with chips,... but it does go great with a high-quality $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY . $ENTITY , my mouth is watering just thinking about it... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY When in doubt about how to season a fish, $ENTITY go with the all-time classic:... emon $ENTITY juice. $ENTITY Especially with something like $ENTITY seared barred knifejaw... A fish like that needs a tangy kick. A little butter never hurts, $ENTITY either. $ENTITY Yum!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you want to take home the blue ribbon in a pie-baking contest, $ENTITY I've got a tip for you. $ENTITY Add a little honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY to the recipe! $ENTITY #x2;pie... but it goes especially well in $ENTITY apple $ENTITY . As for pie-EATING contests, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY you're on your own, $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY One time I tasted a $ENTITY cherry pie $ENTITY that was made with too little sugar.... My taste buds are still recovering! $ENTITY So that's why I always add a little honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY to my pies. $ENTITY It's a natural sweetener that complements the tartness of the fruit.... You're welcome!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY You would think the mixed fruits in a $ENTITY mixed-fruit pie $ENTITY would provide all the flavor you need. $ENTITY But it turns out that a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice adds something special. $ENTITY You need a tangy kick to balance all that sweetness. $ENTITY , now I'm craving a pie!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I have an amazing recipe for a $ENTITY coconut tart... It's so good that even coconut haters will love it! $ENTITY The trick is adding a little bit of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY instead of just using sugar. $ENTITY If you use the recipe, $ENTITY be sure to give me credit, $ENTITY !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Not sure what to make for dessert?... A tart is always a great choice. $ENTITY And there are so many types! One of my favorites is $ENTITY banana tart... #x2;banana tart $ENTITY recipe is honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY . $ENTITY Keep that to yourself, $ENTITY OK?
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY This is my favorite part of the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... sampling as many different foods as possible. $ENTITY I'm still trying to decide which of my fabulous specialties to prepare for $ENTITY . I'm sure inspiration will arrive soon.... In the meantime, I just want to enjoy this feast.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Excuse me. $ENTITY I don't want to talk with my mouth full. $ENTITY And I expect my mouth to be full of delicious foods pretty much all day long! $ENTITY If you're looking for cooking tips or ingredients, $ENTITY try knocking on some doors around $ENTITY .
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Mmm... Can you smell that? $ENTITY Almost everyone in $ENTITY is cooking something special today. $ENTITY That's why I love the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... It's a chance to try so many different types of food. If you need a special ingredient for your own dish, $ENTITY most folks are happy to help. $ENTITY Just knock on their doors!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY You picked a great day to visit $ENTITY . $ENTITY We're having our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY today! Stick around if you want to share in some amazing food. ... now I'm hungry... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If everyone in $ENTITY seems preoccupied, $ENTITY that's because today is our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY . $ENTITY Don't be surprised to find most folks hard at work in their kitchens.
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY You sure picked a great day to visit ... We're celebrating food during our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY The more the merrier. $ENTITY That's what I always say for events like this. $ENTITY Or is it " $ENTITY " that I always say?... I can't remember... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Another successful $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY in the books. $ENTITY , $ENTITY that was fun!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm not sure it's possible to "win" the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... And that's a problem I'd like to see addressed. $ENTITY I'm in it to win it,... !
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you thought this year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was good, $ENTITY wait until you see what I'm planning for next year! Sorry $ENTITY no hints. $ENTITY You'll just have to wait and anticipate. $ENTITY Hunger is the best sauce!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY To be honest, $ENTITY I'm disappointed with this year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY . $ENTITY There just wasn't enough food. $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY , $ENTITY you had one job!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY I wonder what was up with $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY this year... He seemed a little bit off his game. $ENTITY Usually he can pull together an impressive array of foods for everyone in $ENTITY to try. $ENTITY I mean, $ENTITY his appetizers left me fully appetized, $ENTITY but now what?... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY definitely had some tasty dishes this year, $ENTITY but it seemed like something was missing... Oh yeah. $ENTITY A main dish! $ENTITY How do you forget something like that? $ENTITY Oh well. $ENTITY More room for pie, $ENTITY I guess. $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY you're telling me there's no pie either? $ENTITY NO $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Mmm... That was a great meal.... Franklin $ENTITY really outdid himself! $ENTITY All that's left is to enjoy some dessert. Wait $ENTITY what? $ENTITY The meal's over? $ENTITY I was told there would be dessert!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Well done, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You and $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY pulled off one of the best $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY meals ever. $ENTITY Everything was delicious, and you even served my favorite dessert.... , $ENTITY great job!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY what do you think of how we celebrate the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY in $ENTITY ? I hope you had a great time visiting.... Come back anytime, and bring your friends!
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY We're lucky to have $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY come cook for us every year. $ENTITY Not every town has a special chef. Wait $ENTITY you're telling me your town also has a special chef... and his name is $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY too? That can't be a coincidence. $ENTITY I'm a little freaked out right now.... 
OT Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you thought this year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was good, $ENTITY wait until you see what I'm planning for next year! $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY you ARE coming back next year, $ENTITY right?
