NPC Asami .... .
NPC Asami ... I haven't got a free claw right now. $ENTITY I'm sorry.
NPC Asami Pardon me, please. $ENTITY I can't help you right now... .
NPC Asami ... I'm a bit busy right now... .
NPC Asami ... Mabel... can you take care of this customer here?
NPC Asami I just can't let my claws stray from all this work... I'm sorry!
NPC Asami If you need something, $ENTITY do you think you could ask the clerk over there?
NPC Asami ... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY Sorry about that.... She always gets like that whenever she's focused on something.
NPC Asami .... .
NPC Asami Um... . I do appreciate your coming in so often, but... I've just got a ton of work to do... I'm very sorry!
NPC Asami I'm sorry... . I can't spare any time right now to chat... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY Mabel... Hey, Sis, $ENTITY can you take care of this customer, please?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY sorry about that!... If you need something, $ENTITY I'm more than happy to help you out in any way I can!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY did you need something?... Please let me know if there's something I can help you with!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Umm... Mayor... , is it?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Umm... is it?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY What gives, Sis?... You almost never recall a customer's name!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Don't say things you don't need to, $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY . Be respectful. $ENTITY Please feel free to take a look around. Don't mind us at all.
NPC Asami I don't have anything to offer you by way of hospitality, but I do hope you'll take your time looking around.
NPC Asami You seem like a very busy person, but yet you always pop in to check on us... That means a lot to me, $ENTITY .
NPC Asami Oh, $ENTITY ! You're looking well. How nice! $ENTITY It's very sweet of you to always make a point of stopping by... $ENTITY I feel awful that I never even have the time to make you a cup of tea.... I really wish we had one more set of claws around. Then I could take the time to sit and chat with you... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, now, Sis!... There you go again focusing on what we don't have... How can you complain now that $ENTITY Label $ENTITY is back with us? $ENTITY Don't you remember the three of us sisters promised to work hard together from here on out?
NPC Asami ... Tee hee hee!... You're right, $ENTITY Mabel... My apologies. $ENTITY Either way, ... even though we don't have much to offer, $ENTITY please feel free to stop by when you can.
NPC Asami If you see anything you like, just let $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY know and she can help you!
NPC Asami $ENTITY , thanks so much for stopping by today.
NPC Asami Hi, ... Welcome! $ENTITY Thanks so much for making our shop your favorite in town.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Tee hee... Gee, Sis, you've $ENTITY become fast friends with $ENTITY , huh? $ENTITY Lately, she's been all, "Do you think $ENTITY will come by today?"... Tee hee hee hee hee!... She starts asking about that before we've even opened the store in the morning!
NPC Asami $ENTITY OH! $ENTITY MABEL $ENTITY !
NPC Asami $ENTITY Ah hee hee! $ENTITY Oh, come on! $ENTITY 
NPC Asami $ENTITY , it's always so nice to see you!
NPC Asami $ENTITY All this fine stitchwork really gets my shoulders to cramp something fierce, that's for sure... $ENTITY But after we close today, $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY said she'd give me a good massage.... Right?... Mabel $ENTITY ?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Ohh, I'm on my feet $ENTITY all day long! This lower back of mine is always aching... Ooh... . Ahh... . $ENTITY Ha! Gotcha! $ENTITY Unlike my ancient sister, I'm still young and spry, so my back is perfectly fine! $ENTITY 
NPC Asami $ENTITY MABEL $ENTITY !
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, I'm just kidding! Come on now, Sis... Chill out and loosen up a bit!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, ... Welcome! $ENTITY I feel terrible that you take time out of your day to come see me, yet I never have a single moment to chat. The profit margin on our clothing is so low, no matter how hard I work, it feels like I get nowhere!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Hold up a sec, Sis!... Haven't we had this conversation before? $ENTITY "Make something high quality, and make it fast and on the cheap!" Sound familiar? $ENTITY Who says those EXACT words like they're quickly going out of style?
NPC Asami $ENTITY B- but,... Mabel... You take pride in your work like I do, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY I mean, our hearts go into making our clothes, $ENTITY don't they? So $ENTITY don't you want to be able to offer them for a low price that customers will prefer?
NPC Asami $ENTITY AAAAAAARGH! $ENTITY The customers might be just fine with it, but YOU aren't, Sis! You aren't a machine! .... Look, $ENTITY let's just forget about it. I've always loved that worker-bee mentality of yours, anyway.
NPC Asami ... #xE; $ENTITY Mabel... Did you say something? $ENTITY I was lost in thought there thinking about my work, $ENTITY so I didn't hear you.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Tee hee hee... I didn't say a word, Sis! You just keep on working!
NPC Asami I'm really cruising through my work today! $ENTITY I'm in the sewing zone!
NPC Asami How are things for you, $ENTITY ?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Welcome, ... As you can see, I'm just as busy as always. $ENTITY Since my other younger sister, $ENTITY Label $ENTITY , has come home after living far away for so long... Well, it just made sense to expand the shop a little bit. $ENTITY But that means I've got to work even harder than ever before... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY You've got that right, Sis! $ENTITY Now that $ENTITY Label $ENTITY is home with us, we've started carrying more types of clothing and accessories as well! $ENTITY Label $ENTITY spent some time working under a pretty famous fashion designer named $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY . $ENTITY During that time, $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY gave her the professional name of $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY to use as a designer. $ENTITY It's our dream to make the $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY brand famous around the world, starting right here in $ENTITY !
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, now!... Mabel... Aren't you kind of embarrassed to talk on about that stuff in front of $ENTITY ?!
NPC Asami $ENTITY But, Sis, what could possibly be embarrassing about it?!... 
NPC Asami $ENTITY Yes, as I was saying,... As the mayor of $ENTITY , we'd love for you to push the $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY brand as the symbol of our town!
NPC Asami $ENTITY , if you don't mind, we'd love for you to support $ENTITY Label $ENTITY 's and our dream as well!
NPC Asami I'm so grateful to be doing the work I love while surrounded by my dear, sweet sisters. $ENTITY I'm sure I'd be punished somehow if I complained too much about how rough it is, though. $ENTITY Tee hee hee!
NPC Asami $ENTITY , thanks for always taking time to stop by our shop!
NPC Asami $ENTITY I should thank you as well.... Thanks a whole bunch!
NPC Asami It's Monday today, so... here's to another week!
NPC Asami You may not know this, but people are known to slack off the most on Tuesdays. $ENTITY It's true! If a seamstress is going to make a mistake, you can bet your buttons it'll be on a Tuesday! Mother used to say that like it was some sort of ancient wisdom... .
NPC Asami Well, it's Wednesday... . or hump day, as they call itwhoever "they" are. $ENTITY Sometimes that hump looks huge, but let's both try to get over it!
NPC Asami You know, every week, after we close up on Thursdays, I like to relax and watch a little TV. Yesterday $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY recorded my favorite soap for me, Pointed Love: ... . The two main characters are porcupines who break up, get back together, break up again... . You know, the typical soap routine. $ENTITY I wonder what happened this week... Ah, I can't wait to see what Esther is up to. She came back in Season 5. I also read spoilers in Porcupine TV Weekly about how Reginald will be getting a quill transplant. Again. $ENTITY But really, it's that indecisive heroine who keeps me watching. $ENTITY Sometimes, I get jealous of her.
NPC Asami Thank goodness it's Friday!... , will you be able to $ENTITY rest up tomorrow? $ENTITY What's that... ? What am I doing tomorrow afternoon? $ENTITY Why... . nothing in particular. $ENTITY I'll most likely be sewing and embroidering. You know... like I do every weekend.
NPC Asami .... What?! $ENTITY Are you telling me I should take Saturdays off?! $ENTITY Tee hee hee hee hee! Yeah, right, ... You must know... Saturdays are our busiest days, of course! $ENTITY It's crucial to take advantage of those times when everyone else is relaxing. If you want to get something done, then just get it done! That's what Dad used to say anyway... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY So nice of you to pay us a visit... And on a Sunday too! $ENTITY What? Who, me?... Tee hee! $ENTITY I'm happiest here at work, don't you know? $ENTITY Plus, I get to chitchat with our customers sometimes... .
NPC Asami Even though I'm inside the shop all day, I still get happy on days with beautiful weather like today. On days like this, I find myself making a lot of bright, colorful clothes.
NPC Asami When I see the sky glazed over with clouds, $ENTITY I feel gloomy and kind of in a sort of funk. Those are the days when it's best to make some really vivid, colorful clothes to help boost my spirit.
NPC Asami It really means a lot to me to have you peek in on us during a rainy day like today.
NPC Asami It's really coming down out there today, isn't it? $ENTITY We sell umbrellas in the accessories shop just next door, so if you need one, pop over there right away.
NPC Asami It's cold outside today, isn't it? $ENTITY Make sure you bundle up in something warm so you don't catch yourself a cold.
NPC Asami It really means a lot to me to have you peek in on us when it's such a snowy day like today. $ENTITY We're fine!
NPC Asami Now that I think of it... $ENTITY It's probably around that time of year where the town is filled with fluttering cherry blossoms. Mmm, we often went to look at the flowers when $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY was still just a little baby porcupette. I remember one time when $ENTITY Label $ENTITY made a necklace out of the petals and put them around $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY 's neck. Little $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY was so happy... .
NPC Asami We're completely into a glorious spring now, aren't we? $ENTITY I bet you'd feel even better if you picked up some new clothes!
NPC Asami The weather goes from being warm to hot, so people start switching their wardrobes pretty hurriedly. That just means I've got to keep at my machine to produce enough to keep up with the demand!
NPC Asami Is your summer wardrobe all ready?
NPC Asami Just like all the summers before, this one sure is hot... Every year around this time, $ENTITY our sleeveless line of clothing picks up in sales like you wouldn't believe.
NPC Asami September's such a difficult month, because the temperatures during the day and night are so different. I'm really impressed by the people who can find a style that lets them be both warm and cool at once.
NPC Asami Are you starting to get your clothes ready for winter? $ENTITY It's best to have them well before it starts getting cold.
NPC Asami I get the feeling this year's winter is going to be another cold one, just like last year. We've prepared a lot of winter clothing just for this reason, $ENTITY so please check them out!
NPC Asami This year's winter is shaping up to be a really cold one... I hope you enjoy dressing up in our winter fashions. They'll make you feel warm inside and out!
NPC Asami It's finally getting a little warmer around these parts. $ENTITY We have some spring items in the store, so please check them out if you have the time.
NPC Asami It's always so good to see you, $ENTITY .
NPC Asami $ENTITY Tee hee hee! What might you be shopping for today?
NPC Asami $ENTITY , what kind of clothes $ENTITY do you really like?
NPC Asami $ENTITY Thanks for stopping in!
NPC Asami $ENTITY If you're looking to do some clothes shopping, $ENTITY just let me know!
NPC Asami $ENTITY It's got to be... white-and-green gingham plaid, of course!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Ugh! $ENTITY Not everyone wants the $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY special, no matter how much you keep trying!
NPC Asami Oh, ... welcome!
NPC Asami If you would like to use the sewing machine, just let me know. $ENTITY I'd like to use it! I'm good for now.
NPC Asami ... if you ever feel like using the sewing machine, please just let me know. $ENTITY I'd like to use it! I'm good for now.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh... That reminds me, ... I have something I want to give you. It's just a little present. $ENTITY Here you go.
NPC Asami This $ENTITY is one of the $ENTITY mannequins $ENTITY used to display things in our store, but... since we have extra, $ENTITY maybe you'd like to take one home? $ENTITY With a mannequin, you can put both clothing and accessories on it to make a full outfit. You can even use it to quickly change your clothes. $ENTITY However, since it's very valuable, I hope you won't try giving it away to other people or something. $ENTITY I feel like you share our interest in fashion, $ENTITY , so I thought you might like something like this... . Please take it home and give it a try when you have a spare minute!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, that's right. Did you notice that big sewing machine over there? $ENTITY I've been using this machine of mine for quite a while now, so it acts up from time to time... . $ENTITY My sisters just couldn't stand it anymore, so they got me that nice, new one as a present.
NPC Asami $ENTITY It's true, we did!... But listen to this, ... Sis says she can't figure out how to use the machine, $ENTITY so it's just been sitting there unused. $ENTITY This machine uses the $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS camera $ENTITY to read the $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY of custom designs. You can also create a $ENTITY QR Code for designs you've created... It's an amazing machine specially made for professionals, but it just sits there collecting dust! $ENTITY I'm not sure if we've given her a sewing machine or a paperweight in the shape of a sewing machine!
NPC Asami $ENTITY But... $ENTITY but, $ENTITY Mabel... I'd hate to see this machine you two gave me break down because I tried to use it without knowing how... . Plus, I've never really used a sewing machine that big before, $ENTITY so I'm a little afraid to touch it... . $ENTITY Hmmmm ... Oh, I've got it!... , you look like you'd be handy with a machine like that... . $ENTITY Why don't you get some use out of it $ENTITY in my stead? $ENTITY I'm sure I could learn how to use it if I watched you try it out first. $ENTITY I don't mind you using it as long as I'm not busy with other things. $ENTITY If you'd like to give it a try, just let me know.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Ah, of course! $ENTITY Please feel free! $ENTITY What would you like to do? $ENTITY Read a QR Code. Create a QR Code. How do I use it? I changed my mind.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh? Are you sure?... If you want to use it later, just let me know.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh, you're curious about how to use it? Well that makes two of us! $ENTITY I still don't really know myself, but I can read you what's written in the instruction manual... .
NPC Asami Let's see. The first page is about how to read a QR Code... "First, you'll need a $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY of a custom design that was made using $ENTITY Animal Crossing: New Leaf... . "Then choose $ENTITY Read a QR Code $ENTITY on the machine and decide where you'll save the design you're obtaining. "After that, $ENTITY follow the instructions to read the QR Code using the $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS camera $ENTITY . "A normal design requires $ENTITY one QR Code $ENTITY . Pro designs require a set of up to $ENTITY four QR Code $ENTITY patterns."
NPC Asami The next page is about how to get a QR Code so that you can share your own custom designs... . "First, choose $ENTITY Create a QR Code $ENTITY on the machine... "Then select the custom design you'd like a $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY for. $ENTITY "The QR Code that's created will be saved onto the $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY inside your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS system $ENTITY . "For normal designs, only a $ENTITY single $ENTITY QR Code will be formed, but pro designs will generate as many as ... ."
NPC Asami ... Well, that seems to be the long and short of it. $ENTITY I guess you'll just have to try it and see how it goes.
NPC Asami You'd like to read a $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY of a custom design someone made? $ENTITY You'll need to replace one of your current custom designs to do that.... Is that all right? $ENTITY That's OK! I changed my mind.
NPC Asami $ENTITY If you don't want to erase one of your designs, you could always talk to $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY and have her store it here.
NPC Asami Then, first things first, you'll need to choose the spot where you'd like to save the custom design.
NPC Asami Hmm ... It seems Nintendo 3DS Camera did not launch.... You can still try again whenever you'd like.
NPC Asami $ENTITY It looks like everything worked fine! $ENTITY Please feel free to use it again whenever you want.
NPC Asami In that case, let's start by picking out the custom design you'd like to make a $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY for. ... I'm sure you know this, $ENTITY but you should only pick designs that you yourself created, $ENTITY .
NPC Asami Oh my. It looks like you pressed the Quit button.... You can start over again whenever you choose.
NPC Asami $ENTITY All right, now we let the machine work its magic and create your $ENTITY QR Code... It shouldn't take long... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY Well, it looks like everything went smoothly. Phew. $ENTITY According to the manual... any $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY made by the machine is saved to your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY . You can even use $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS Camera $ENTITY to check out a $ENTITY QR Code $ENTITY you have saved. $ENTITY I really don't understand what that all means, but I'm sure impressed by what these new machines can do!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Well, it looks like everything went smoothly. That's a relief! $ENTITY No matter how many times we do this, $ENTITY I always get nervous about that last part.
NPC Asami $ENTITY Oh dear... It looks like it spit out an error message of some sort... . Let's see what the problem is... .
NPC Asami $ENTITY An SD Card is not inserted.... It says. $ENTITY , I think that means you need to check if you have an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS $ENTITY or not. But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Your QR Code could not be saved... because the SD Card is locked.... It says. $ENTITY , I think that means you need to check if your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY is write-protected or not. But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Your QR Code could not be saved because there isn't enough room on the SD Card.... It says. $ENTITY , I think that means you need to check how much space you have on your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY . Could you? But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Your QR Code could not be saved because you cannot save any more pictures to this SD Card.... That's what it says. $ENTITY , I think that means you need to organize the files on your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY first. Could you do that? But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Your QR Code could not be saved because the SD Card could not be recognized.... It says. $ENTITY , could you check your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY and then try again? $ENTITY But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
NPC Asami $ENTITY Your QR Code could not be saved because the SD Card could not be recognized.... It says. $ENTITY , could you double-check your $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY and then try again? $ENTITY But don't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out!
