ZK FreeD Moving $ENTITY Ahh, $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY .... But... I uh... I still don't know you very well, $ENTITY and it's too soon to move out...

ZK FreeD Moving ... Huh, $ENTITY what? $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY that's where you're supposed to stop me from deciding to go... To be honest, $ENTITY I was just testing you. $ENTITY I wanted to see if you'd really try to stop me... I'd be too sad to say good-bye to you like this, $ENTITY let me stay here in town a little longer... 
ZK FreeD Moving .... Wait $ENTITY whaaat? $ENTITY Aren't you gonna try to stop me, ... I thought... I thought you were my best friend... Was I wrong? $ENTITY Well then, $ENTITY I'm not moving out anymore! $ENTITY Not just yet! $ENTITY Instead, $ENTITY let's form a friendship that's stronger than any the world has ever seen!...
