AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! So much cooking going on! $ENTITY Argh, $ENTITY I'm so busy... 
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Let's see... I can mix this and that up real good later... What? $ENTITY Don't look at me like that! $ENTITY I'm gonna blush! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm actually a pretty good cook! $ENTITY Does that surprise you? $ENTITY The trick is to hum to yourself while you work!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hmmm... This could be bad! $ENTITY I don't suppose you have any spare $ENTITY ? I totally forgot to get some, and that's gonna put me way behind. $ENTITY If you can get me some, I'll trade you for something I have here. What do you say? $ENTITY ?
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Aha! $ENTITY So you... brought the $ENTITY I asked for? $ENTITY It's all yours! I'm tapped out.
AN Ev Harvest Man... I can't believe I forgot the ... Take mine! I'm fresh out.
AN Ev Harvest Really? 'Cause if you were up for it, I'd trade some of my ingredients for your ... Work with me on this, ... Come on! $ENTITY !

AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Aw, come on! $ENTITY Don't get my hopes up like that! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh no! Not this!... Hmmm... I need ... I need it bad! $ENTITY !

AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY I'm powered up now!... Full throttle! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY So what've you got cookin' today?
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY Well, you should try putting in some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY ! Works great! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY Texture is really important for that! $ENTITY It'd be a good idea to put in some crunchy fruit like $ENTITY apples $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY You should put in some honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY ! $ENTITY That'll really mellow it out for you! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY The secret to that is to use $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY to make it tangy! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY You should throw in some $ENTITY butter $ENTITY to give it some body and aroma! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? You want to make ... Wow... Look at you go! $ENTITY Let's see... For that, toss in some $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hmmm... Wonder what the plaza is looking like. $ENTITY When things settle down a bit, I should go have a look!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hohoho! $ENTITY I'd been thinking of a lot of different menu items for today. $ENTITY It's nice to see them turn out!
AN Ev Harvest ... The more I cook, the more new ideas I get. $ENTITY Ha! Listen to me! $ENTITY Maybe I'm cut out for cooking after all, $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY ! The stuff you gave me was perfect! $ENTITY My recipe turned out great! $ENTITY Thanks! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest ... Thanks for before!... You really helped me out! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY It's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... This is the holiday where everyone who thinks they can cook... cooks!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The whole town smells great!... I love the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's the town $ENTITY Harvest Festival... It's the one time of year when it's OK to stuff yourself silly!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY There's a good smell in town!... Makes sense... Today was the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The ... Harvest Festival $ENTITY was a huge success this year! $ENTITY I'm already pumped for next year! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was great! $ENTITY It's my favorite $ENTITY holiday!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The food today was perfect! $ENTITY Haha! I'm so glad you helped me! $ENTITY Thanks! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY Today was a really busy day! $ENTITY People who are always cooking can probably just whip up something pretty quick... I need more practice to get that good! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY It's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , so all I thought about today was food... There were too many side dishes! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest At this year's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY looked like he was pretty on edge! $ENTITY But that's OK, right? $ENTITY There's always next year!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I kind of thought there'd be a lot to eat today, but... sometimes holidays are unpredictable! $ENTITY Well, whatever. It was still a good day! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY looked like he was on edge at the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... But, hey, at least he tried his best!... The appetizer was tasty! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I kinda thought there would be more to eat today... But whatever. The food we had was tasty!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY looked pretty on edge at the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY this year! $ENTITY But he did his best, right? $ENTITY I mean, the soup was perfect! $ENTITY Can't wait until next year! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I didn't get to eat much today... I'm still kind of hungry! $ENTITY But that soup $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY made was awesome! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The chef at this year's festival was something else! $ENTITY I was impressed! $ENTITY Making a main course that good in that amount of time... He's amazing! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm so full of delicious food today! $ENTITY This is heaven! $ENTITY Ahhh! $ENTITY The main course was particularly good... .
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The chef at this year's festival was something else! $ENTITY I was impressed! $ENTITY I can't believe he even whipped up dessert in time for the feast! $ENTITY I was really surprised! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm so full of delicious food today! $ENTITY This is heaven! $ENTITY Ahh, the dessert was fantastic! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The chef at this year's festival was something else! $ENTITY I was impressed! $ENTITY That dessert wasn't like anything you can buy in a store... That's the kind of dish only a pro can deliver!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm so full of delicious food today! $ENTITY This is heaven! $ENTITY The dessert was unbelievably good! $ENTITY That's what you get when a pro is doing the cooking! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY 'Cause, ... if you're making $ENTITY oysters... throw in some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY ! $ENTITY They say you get more nutrients from the $ENTITY oysters $ENTITY if you eat those two things together! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY maybe that information will come in handy while you're cooking today, $ENTITY .
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY With a $ENTITY mushroom salad... it's a good idea to throw in something that has some crunchiness to it. $ENTITY Like... apples... Make the slices the same thickness to keep the same level of crunchiness throughout! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY maybe that'll come in handy while you're cooking today! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Fruit salad $ENTITY , huh? $ENTITY Maybe put some honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY into the $ENTITY dressing? $ENTITY Yeah, that's right! $ENTITY Vinegar alone will clash too much with the $ENTITY fruit... But be careful not to add too much honey! $ENTITY It'll get too sweet, like a dessert! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you've got a $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY with lots of stuff in it, $ENTITY you're going to want to toss some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY in there. $ENTITY If you add a flashier flavor, $ENTITY you run the risk of it overwhelming the taste of the other ingredients. $ENTITY Give it a try! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you're making a seafood salad with fish... squeezing some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on there really brings out the flavor! $ENTITY And I think it helps get rid of the fishy smell too! $ENTITY Lemon and fish make a great combination! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY you should give that a try when you're cooking today! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY 'Cause, ... if you're making $ENTITY mushroom bisque $ENTITY , throw some $ENTITY butter $ENTITY in at the end! $ENTITY It'll give it some nice body! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY 'Cause, ... if you're making $ENTITY shellfish chowder $ENTITY , throw in some $ENTITY butter $ENTITY at the end! $ENTITY It'll give that soup some body! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY There are all sorts of soups in this world... but I love $ENTITY bouillabaisse... You gotta use fresh $ENTITY fish $ENTITY and squeeze some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY in as a finishing touch! $ENTITY Aww, yeah! $ENTITY I want some soup right now! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY There are all sorts of soups in the world, but... fruit soup $ENTITY is delicious! $ENTITY You have to use fresh fruit $ENTITY and squeeze in some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY as a finishing touch! $ENTITY When you're tired, some chilled fruit soup will perk you right up, baby! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY 'Cause, ... lobster $ENTITY tom yum kung $ENTITY is insanely delicious, dude! $ENTITY If you use a fresh-caught lobster, you can make some killer broth! $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY And after that it all comes down to the $ENTITY coconut... It mellows out the soup just right! $ENTITY The milk of a $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY is basically magic! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY For fish, the best thing to do is saut it! $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY Pan fried is the way to go! $ENTITY But no matter how you prepare it, $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY will make it lip- smackingly good!

AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY For a $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pie, you really want to bring out the sweetness of the fresh ingredients. $ENTITY And for that you'll want the honey from a $ENTITY beehive... It brings out the fruit's true sweetness... and then intensifies it!

AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY When you're making a pie with lots of $ENTITY different fruits $ENTITY in it, you can't use sugar! $ENTITY The fruits will give you all the sweetness you need, $ENTITY so use it! $ENTITY Still, I think a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY would enhance the flavor... Yeah, $ENTITY that doesn't sound bad! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY For a $ENTITY coconut tart $ENTITY , you really want to bring out the sweetness of the fresh ingredients. $ENTITY And for that you'll want the honey from a $ENTITY beehive... It brings out the fruit's true sweetness... and then intensifies it!

AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY I was just thinking something smells nice, $ENTITY but really it's the combination of smells from every house in town! $ENTITY Seems like everyone's getting in on the cooking action for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... Maybe later $ENTITY I'll go cheer people onand try to snatch some food! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY For today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , I think I might just focus on the eating side of things. $ENTITY Course I'll gladly help cook if it means getting more delicious food! $ENTITY This is definitely a foodie season! $ENTITY My gourmet blood is percolating! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Looks like preparations are coming along in the plaza! $ENTITY Wonder what $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is making. $ENTITY His cooking is pretty famous, so $ENTITY I've got high expectations! $ENTITY Ahh, $ENTITY I can't wait! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Look at you! $ENTITY You sure picked a good time for a visit! $ENTITY Today is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... It's a holiday celebrating $ENTITY 's fall flavors! $ENTITY There are people in their houses making food for the festival, $ENTITY so cheer 'em on! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY By the way, $ENTITY , have you talked to $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY yet? $ENTITY Chef $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY only comes to town during the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... He's kinda famous, so you should try to get a picture with him! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY In fall... absolutely everything just looks delicious somehow. $ENTITY Today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is all about celebrating fall foods!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Man! The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is fun! $ENTITY Next year I think I'll focus more on the cooking side of things... All right! $ENTITY No time to waste! $ENTITY Time to start training my gourmuscles! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, check me out! $ENTITY I got a picture with $ENTITY Franklin... He's only here once a year, so... maybe it'll be worth something someday? $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest Well, the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is over! $ENTITY The smell of cooking throughout the town is gone until next year... That's sorta sad, $ENTITY .
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY didn't seem like he was having a good time this year. $ENTITY He was saying he couldn't get the right ingredients... But there's always next year! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is over! $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's food was really amazing! $ENTITY It was a real experience eating it! $ENTITY To tell the truth, $ENTITY I wanted to stuff myself a bit more! ... 
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is over!... Franklin $ENTITY 's soup was exquisite! $ENTITY I was totally satisfied! $ENTITY To be honest, though, I wish there had been more to eat... Oh well! Next year! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY I ate a ton of really good stuff today! $ENTITY Some dessert at the end would have been nice... but I guess you don't always get everything you want!
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's dessert was... awesome! $ENTITY Hey, weren't you helping him gather the ingredients? $ENTITY Great job! $ENTITY It was perfect! ... 
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY should have better advertising. $ENTITY I hope we get more visitors for next year's festival! $ENTITY !
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is over, but the whole town still smells good! $ENTITY Do you think people will talk about the aromas when you get back to your own town? $ENTITY They'll be all like, "You smell like the best food ever made, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;ady $ENTITY #x0;o!" ... 
AN Ev Harvest $ENTITY We sure had great weather for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... And you got to see all sorts of cool things, right? $ENTITY When you get home, you should tell everyone about $ENTITY 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
