ZK FreeG Visitor So... how's your town in comparison to ours?... It's a bigger city. It's more country. It's the same.
ZK FreeG Visitor By the way, $ENTITY do you know what the special fruit in this town is?... Yup, I know! No, I don't.
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY I know why you came to visit our town today... You came to look for gossip about the mayor of ... right? $ENTITY ? $ENTITY , huh... I haven't heard any real scandalous gossip lately.... Hey, instead, $ENTITY why don't you just interview me?... I promise I won't disappoint! I'm all about scandals!
ZK FreeG Visitor ... is everyone doing OK... since I left town? $ENTITY ( Um... I'm not sure.
ZK FreeG Visitor How's the town? $ENTITY Has it changed much since I left, ... It's changed! It hasn't changed. I don't know.
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY When you're out and about... your pockets get full pretty quickly, don't they? $ENTITY If that happens, $ENTITY you can leave an item in the locker at the station. I do it all the time. $ENTITY If you leave your items in a locker outside your town, $ENTITY you can pick 'em up from the locker in your town.... So it's fine if you leave your stuff here! No problem at all! $ENTITY Oh, and if you have a closet or other storage furniture in your room,... it's also connected here!
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Heh heh heh. $ENTITY No wonder I felt like we had the same aura... I mean, I don't exactly know how to define whether a place is a big city or not... . $ENTITY But maybe it just means there are more things to do and it's more comfortable where you live? $ENTITY But you know,... just because it's comfortable $ENTITY doesn't mean your heart is fulfilled. $ENTITY What's really important is whether $ENTITY you're happy or not!
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Heh heh. $ENTITY No wonder I was getting a simple, honest vibe from you just now!... Just because you live in the country or a small town... is no reason to be ashamed or anything! $ENTITY When your town's nice and calm, $ENTITY it gives you more peace of mind. $ENTITY And a peaceful mind is truly a nice thing to have,... !
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY there might be some differences... But your town is probably pretty similar to this town. $ENTITY One thing different I can say for sure is... you don't live in my town,... right?
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY never mind then. $ENTITY I was worrying about something I didn't have to, $ENTITY !
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY It's the ... That's the special fruit of ... Bring one back with you if you'd like, and plant it in your hometown to grow more $ENTITY trees!
ZK FreeG Visitor ... Hey, you know you don't have to lie to me,... I know you're just saying that so I won't worry. $ENTITY You're so sweet... 
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Is that so?... Well, that kinda makes me sad... 
ZK FreeG Visitor Well, $ENTITY I guess that means nothing's changed then?... the people there will continue with their own lives... Perhaps it's only natural. $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY Even if it's also a bit sad... 
ZK FreeG Visitor There are things we don't notice until they're gone, right? $ENTITY I'm happy to hear everyone still thinks about me!
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY What are you talking about,... I'm still around! $ENTITY I'll always be with you and everyone from town!... In your hearts... 
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Heh heh heh... Your face tells me you're quite the confident one,... ! $ENTITY I hope someday I can see how it's changed with my own two eyes.
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I'm super relieved to hear that,... I hope $ENTITY continues to b $ENTITY the same lovely town forever and ever,... No matter how far it advances and develops...
ZK FreeG Visitor ... is everyone doing OK since I left town? $ENTITY I know it's nonsense to ask you, $ENTITY but I'm just worried,... . $ENTITY Everyone's doing fine They miss you
ZK FreeG Visitor By any chance,... did you leave that one town,... Um, what was its name again... ? $ENTITY Man, I've totally forgotten. $ENTITY But... one thing's for sure!... I'll never forget the days we spent together!
ZK FreeG Visitor $ENTITY So, ... you're looking more like a mayor now, huh? $ENTITY How are things going in $ENTITY since I left?... Is everyone doing well? $ENTITY I hope I can visit your town sometime soon,... !
