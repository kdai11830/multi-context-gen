FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Hi, ... Welcome back! $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY You're back! $ENTITY And it looks like you were successful. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Oh, good. $ENTITY I had a feeling you'd make it back soon. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Whew! $ENTITY When you didn't come back, $ENTITY I thought something bad might have happened. $ENTITY 
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Hey,... Did you need me for something?
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY How's it going, ... You didn't ask me to come over here to scold me, $ENTITY did you?
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY You wanted to talk to me about something,... 
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY I borrowed this a while ago, $ENTITY and now I'm finally giving it back. $ENTITY I'm sorry I kept it for so long! $ENTITY I put it in a drawer and forgot about it, $ENTITY .
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY Now I remember. $ENTITY Mmm. $ENTITY I should loan you stuff more often. $ENTITY It always comes back smelling like cupcakes. $ENTITY Don't forget, if you need any help baking some, $ENTITY I promised to lick the bowl for you.
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Just as you asked, $ENTITY I hung this in my kitchen for a few days. $ENTITY It should smell like $ENTITY !
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY It really does! $ENTITY I'm not gonna wash this for at least a week.... Thanks a bunch, $ENTITY !
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY I was taking a walk around town yesterday when I found something on the ground. $ENTITY It was sticky with chocolate and covered in ants, $ENTITY so I knew it had to be yours.
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY My ... I didn't realize I'd dropped it. $ENTITY Guess I was too focused on my candy bar. $ENTITY Thanks for picking it up and cleaning it off, $ENTITY .
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY I've been working on a new dessert recipe, and I thought I could get your opinion. What kind of fruit topping would go best on $ENTITY ?
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Hmm... I'm partial to $ENTITY topping, $ENTITY myself.... Especially when you warm it up a little. $ENTITY You'll let me know next time you make some, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Promise me!
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Didn't you say you needed help writing a letter to your cousin? $ENTITY I have time now, $ENTITY so why don't we talk about it?
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY right. $ENTITY I wanted to ask you how to spell something.... But I can't remember what word it was... Darn, $ENTITY I blew my chance to ask you!
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Hey, thanks for coming to get me,... we should chill later. $ENTITY A huh huh huh. I'm gonna go wander around for a while. $ENTITY See ya!
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY Well, guess we're done here. $ENTITY I'll catch you guys later. $ENTITY For now, $ENTITY I've got a juice box and a pack of crayons waiting for me at home.... See ya!
FU Q04 3P_Bo $ENTITY I guess we're done here. $ENTITY Which is good, $ENTITY because it's almost time for $ENTITY my favorite cartoon. $ENTITY I've only ever missed one episode, ya know. $ENTITY Good thing I always tape it. $ENTITY I'll see you both later!
