OT Ev Countdown It's a little sad to think that today is the last day of $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's been the BEST year. But the party tonight is going to be pretty good too!... I'm ready to rock out at the countdown!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Happy New Year,... !
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY There's less than an hour left until midnight! $ENTITY Do you know what that means, $ENTITY ? Exactly! $ENTITY I'm running out of time to complete last year's resolution!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY One of my New Year's resolutions is to keep telling people I'm 5 years younger than I actually am.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY So $ENTITY was $ENTITY a good year for you, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Any favorite memories? $ENTITY I think I'm about to create the best memory of the year at tonight's party.... !
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Ahhh... so sleepy. $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY What am I doing? $ENTITY The big countdown is less than 30 minutes away! $ENTITY Time to wake up, ... You're still a young $ENTITY who can party with the best of them.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Ah, ... My New Year's resolution was to learn to cook $ENTITY . And I did, $ENTITY in the first week of the year. $ENTITY Maybe I should set my sights a little higher this year.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Isn't it exciting staying up this late? $ENTITY What are you going to do at midnight? $ENTITY I'm going to scream!
OT Ev Countdown Oh, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Less than 5 minutes left! $ENTITY My heart is racing!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY here we are, $ENTITY less than 5 minutes from celebrating New Year's Eve together.... So weird!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY , I can't believe $ENTITY is almost over... 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Are you ready for the new year? $ENTITY 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Less than 1 minute to go! $ENTITY My heart is aflutter... 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY I know most of $ENTITY is out celebrating, $ENTITY but I prefer to ring in the new year in my own home. It's just a bit cozier here than $ENTITY out in the cold, $ENTITY don't you think?... ?
OT Ev Countdown ... it's been quite a year. $ENTITY Good memories, good friends. $ENTITY And... you. $ENTITY Ha! $ENTITY You didn't think I was serious, $ENTITY did you, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY You're one of my best friends.
OT Ev Countdown Less than an hour to go... and here I am relaxing at home. $ENTITY It's exactly what I wanted. Are you heading out into the cold with everyone else in ... Brrr! $ENTITY It's just too chilly for me.
OT Ev Countdown It's hard to believe that $ENTITY is coming to an end. ... One of my New Year's resolutions is to have even more fun next year. $ENTITY Are you with me,... ?
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY The excitement of New Year's Eve always makes it hard to sleep. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY people shooting off fireworks and blasting heavy metal also has something to do with it.
OT Ev Countdown ... I can't imagine standing out in the cold until midnight. $ENTITY Even with less than 30 minutes left, $ENTITY I'd rather stay warm and cozy in here.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Less than 5 minutes to go! $ENTITY Better hurry if you're going to come up with a resolution, $ENTITY .
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Only a few minutes left in ... 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Maybe I'll give myself a quick mani-pedi to start the new year off right.... Oh! $ENTITY There's no time!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY , it's almost midnight! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY It's really sinking in... that $ENTITY is almost over! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Looking good,... . $ENTITY Isn't it fun to get into the spirit of the big countdown?
OT Ev Countdown ... Looks like you're ready to party. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY as you can see, $ENTITY I too am ready to party. $ENTITY Ha!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY , $ENTITY you aren't dressed for the occasion. $ENTITY Don't worry $ENTITY there's still time to get ready. $ENTITY I'm sure you can find a festive New Year's hat somewhere in $ENTITY . $ENTITY Even at the last minute!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY , $ENTITY what do you think of my new hat? $ENTITY Is it festive enough? $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY I can't tell you where I got it.... We can't show up to the big countdown all matchy-matchy.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Going all out for the big countdown, $ENTITY eh, ... Looking good!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY , that's the spirit! Where'd you get such a cool hat?
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Don't you think you should dress up a little for the big countdown? $ENTITY At least put on a fun hat or something. $ENTITY You're going to feel pretty silly if you're the only one in $ENTITY without a hat!
OT Ev Countdown Attention: $ENTITY there are less than 30 shopping minutes remaining in $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So if you want to pick up a special hat for the occasion, $ENTITY you better get on that.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I didn't know the fireworks would be this beautiful. $ENTITY What an amazing show!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY These fireworks remind me of myself. $ENTITY Brilliant, $ENTITY stunning, $ENTITY and inspirational. $ENTITY !
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY , I want to shine as brightly as these fireworks in the new year. $ENTITY But I don't want to burn out and fall to the ground. $ENTITY That's a scary thought!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Ahh... brilliant fireworks against the crisp, $ENTITY clear winter sky.... What a show!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY One of my New Year's resolutions is to live a rich and full life. $ENTITY Just kidding.... It's to buy a new outfit every week.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Are you too excited to sleep? $ENTITY Me too! ... Wait. $ENTITY What time is it? $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY I didn't want to stay up THIS late. $ENTITY I better get to bed, $ENTITY and you should too.
OT Ev Countdown Here's to a great ... Cheers,... !
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You're still awake? $ENTITY Oh,... , $ENTITY it's definitely time for bed. $ENTITY I know... I should listen to my own advice.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY If you want to see the fireworks, $ENTITY you better head outside,... . I think I'm going to stay in. $ENTITY It's too cold! $ENTITY My chattering bones would be louder than the fireworks.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY You know there are fireworks going on outside, $ENTITY right,... I mean, $ENTITY it's fun hanging out with you here, $ENTITY but I want to make sure you don't miss out.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Take my advice,... : $ENTITY don't stay up too late tonight. $ENTITY If you want to get the new year off to a good start,... it's better to be well rested.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY Aren't you going to go watch the fireworks? $ENTITY They aren't going to last all night, $ENTITY you know. At least... they better not!
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY All right,... , $ENTITY I'm not your mother, $ENTITY but it's WAY past your bedtime. $ENTITY Don't you want to start the new year off with a good night of sleep?
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY If you haven't already wished everyone in $ENTITY a happy New Year, time's running out. $ENTITY I'm not trying to kick you out or anything... but at the same time... get out.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY You're still awake? $ENTITY I thought I was the only real night $ENTITY around here.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY It's been fun hanging out tonight,... , $ENTITY but I hope you're not just staying up for my sake. $ENTITY Because when tomorrow morning rolls around... Wait... it's already tomorrow morning! $ENTITY Tomorrow is today! $ENTITY Ahhh! $ENTITY This is confusing.... , $ENTITY I need to go to sleep.
OT Ev Countdown $ENTITY I see you're ready for the big countdown. $ENTITY Looking good!
