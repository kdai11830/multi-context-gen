KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Really, $ENTITY ? ... Are you really that concerned about appearances in photographs? $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmmm? $ENTITY You want to know how I like to recharge?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , I got something important to talk to you about... You got a minute?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY of course I am! $ENTITY Photographs are forever, $ENTITY you know. $ENTITY One bad one could haunt you for years. $ENTITY There's one tragic photo of me eating $ENTITY that still gives me nightmares.
KO 3P Ot ... Really? $ENTITY I don't think you look half bad, no matter what your photos tell you otherwise. $ENTITY If you fuss about all the little things, then you're only gonna notice everything that's wrong! $ENTITY You really shouldn't rank yourself so low, you know?... Am I right?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY thank you, $ENTITY But I assure you, $ENTITY even the cutest of us can look silly in a photo. $ENTITY Even an adorable little guy like you can look goofy if a photographer catches you at the wrong moment.
KO 3P Ot ... Wait, $ENTITY "adorable little guy"?... I ain't adorable, and I ain't little, sister!... Watch it!... 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY I am! $ENTITY When you have your picture taken, you always face the camera straight on and look so imposing. $ENTITY I think you should look into some more natural poses for yourself!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Poses... I've never thought about it before!... Gimme some advice!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Certainly. $ENTITY For example... Look into the camera, turn your body to the side, $ENTITY and lower your chin! $ENTITY Like this!
KO 3P Ot ... Turn my body sideways,... lower my chin... Like this?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY Perfect!... See? $ENTITY You can do it if you put your mind to it! $ENTITY For future reference, $ENTITY this is what's known as a glamour shot. $ENTITY Ha! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Heh... Knock it off! $ENTITY Flattery won't get you nowhere!... All right, maybe it will,... 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY , $ENTITY of course! $ENTITY A classy lady like me can't afford to look weird in a photograph. $ENTITY I've done lots of research on what body position or turn of the head will make me look the best!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Poses, huh... But you always have the same look on your face in every single picture. $ENTITY If I lined them up and looked at them, $ENTITY I'd get chills down my spine!... Is that what you're aiming for?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY I take that as a compliment. $ENTITY That's how you get to be a model $ENTITY by being consistent! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY some might say I'm not TECHNICALLY a model... to which I simply reply, $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh man... I think you'd look a lot better if you just posed naturally!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well... I never thought I'd hear such flattery from you, ... Did I just see a pig fly by? $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY sure! $ENTITY I'm always looking for ways to increase my inner peace. $ENTITY But nothing seems to work. $ENTITY I've tried "power-zen" and "turbo- meditation" and everything. $ENTITY So if you've got some great tip, $ENTITY yeah, $ENTITY I'm all ears!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Let me think... 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY On really clear and sunny days, I'll spend the whole day fishing... Mmm, and drinking some relaxing $ENTITY after a bath ain't bad, either!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY If the ground's all soft after a rainy day, I'll spend the day digging up holes with my trusty shovel... Eating $ENTITY till my gut busts ain't so bad, either!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY I'll ignore my clock and sleep in till 2 or 3 p.m. some days... It ain't so bad spending the day with $ENTITY in one hand and some $ENTITY on the TV! $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY that's pretty great...
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh, you kidder, you! $ENTITY Those are all just things you normally do, aren't they?... I'm talking about all the things that really, truly refresh your body and soul! $ENTITY #x0;
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY For example... bungee jumping out in a valley or skydiving from a helicopter! $ENTITY That's the level of intensity I'm looking for!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY For example... getting KO'd while boxing or thrown onto your back in a judo match! $ENTITY That's the level of intensity I'm looking for!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY For example... screaming at the top of your lungs on a roller coaster... $ENTITY or shrieking with tears streaming down your face in a haunted house! $ENTITY That's the level of intensity I'm looking for!
KO 3P Ot ... Just how stressed out are you?
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Huh?!... Why... $ENTITY are you so formal... ? $ENTITY is watching, you know... 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY I don't care!... #x0; can watch all $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; like! $ENTITY I've been thinking I should tell you as soon as I saw you earlier today, but... the timing just wasn't right!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh... don't worry about that now! $ENTITY Don't hold back!... Just say what's deep in your heart! ,/1 $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY OK... You've got a marker streak on your forehead.
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Ah... Now that you mention it, I was using a permanent marker just this morning! $ENTITY Could it be... It's been on my face ever since then, hasn't it?... You should have spoken up earlier! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY Sorry. My bad!... I thought you'd scold me for "not getting it" or something like that!
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY OK... you've got some broccoli or a chunk of something on your cheek.
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Ah... Now that you mention it, I had a plate of steamed veggies just this morning! $ENTITY Could it be... it's been stuck to my face ever since then?... You should have spoken up earlier! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY OK... you're wearing your clothes totally inside out.
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY You're right!... You should have spoken up earlier! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY OK... you've got some ketchup on your cheek there.
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY Wha?! $ENTITY Ah... Now that you mention it, I had some french fries just this morning for breakfast! $ENTITY Could it be that... it's been on my face ever since then?... You should have spoken up earlier! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ot ... Nah, I think I'll just keep it to myself... 
KO 3P Ot $ENTITY What?!... What are you trying to do to me! $ENTITY Now I'll be wondering about it all day!...
