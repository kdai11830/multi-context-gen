FU Sp Camp_Game2 $ENTITY I know this fun game called Cost-a-Lot. $ENTITY To play, $ENTITY you draw lots that set the price of my items. We look at each item and its price one at a time. $ENTITY You can either buy the item or skip to the next. $ENTITY But once we start the game, $ENTITY you have to buy something. $ENTITY How does that sound? $ENTITY #x0; I'm game! Not interested.
FU Sp Camp_Game2 Oh, $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY I hope it wasn't rude of me to ask.... Anyway, $ENTITY I hope you change your mind later.

We'll look at the items one at a time. $ENTITY First, $ENTITY I'll draw a random slip of paper that has a price on it. If you like the item for that price, $ENTITY you buy it. $ENTITY If not, $ENTITY we move to the next item. $ENTITY But if you don't choose anything by the end, $ENTITY you have to buy item number 5 no matter what. $ENTITY Ready to get started? $ENTITY OK. $ENTITY First up is my ... The price is... Bells... I'll buy it! Next!
