NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! ... OK. Let's talk. Been to the $ENTITY Able Sisters $ENTITY shop recently? $ENTITY You know! The sisters? Run the tailoring shop? With the clothes? And the designs? I know you know! $ENTITY Little inside info: The other day? Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and I? Met with 'em. Talked business. Boom.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY And can I say something? Those sisters? Seem to be close to you, Mr.... Must go way back, eh?
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well. Anyway. We got an invite. Bit of a sit-down. Even the gal who's always working took time. Boom. $ENTITY Served us tasty $ENTITY . Best I've had! $ENTITY Gotta say... that Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . So popular! Everywhere he goes! People love him! LOVE him.... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... It's not $ENTITY like that at all! Stop gabbing and get back to work!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... We had some delicious ... It's a tasty, popular, and innocent dessert!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Ho ho ho! $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ! I do believe you're blushing! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Say. ... Been to $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY 's shop? $ENTITY Yes! $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY . Gardening shop? You know him. Right? Right. $ENTITY The other day? Me. Him. Bunch of others. Had a weed-pulling contest. Right in the shopping district. Bang.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Hey, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . Remember $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY ? That day? He was amazing.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Usually a relaxed fellow, that $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY . Not fast paced. Never in a hurry. Nice fella.... And well liked. Practically the shopping-district mascot. So calm all the time! At least I thought so. Then boom. Guy launches into this big lecture. Environmental concerns. Big talk! $ENTITY So full of energy. Got me riled up! Went on and on. $ENTITY Overdid it a bit. Fainted after he stopped talking... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well... he did go on for four hours.... Leif $ENTITY 's passionate spiel sure got everyone fired up, though! $ENTITY We were pulling weeds until the sun went down! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well... he did go on for four hours.... Leif $ENTITY 's passionate spiel sure got everyone fired up, though! $ENTITY He had us pulling weeds until late at night despite the crazy heat! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well... he did go on for four hours.... Leif $ENTITY 's passionate spiel sure got everyone fired up, though! $ENTITY He had us pulling weeds until late at night despite the freezing cold! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well. The matter's settled. Far as I'm concerned. Don't think anyone can argue. Bang. $ENTITY Guy's environmentally minded. No question. Made me feel like I need to pay closer attention to this stuff.
NPC Honma 3P ... Let's talk. Been to the raccoon brothers' shop lately? $ENTITY You know! The brothers? $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY ? With the selling of all the stuff? The cool, cool stuff? $ENTITY Little inside info: The other day? Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and I? Met with 'em. Talked business. Bang.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Can I guess? Took 'em under your wing, right? Bang? Little apprentices?
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Anyway. Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . Kind of stern with the wee ones. Gave 'em a talking to. Caught ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY off guard. $ENTITY Suppose it's not unusual. Older, wiser businessman. Firm hand with the younger generation? Bang. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... I merely wanted those boys to know that when their shop opened we became rivals, hm? $ENTITY I told them they are responsible for their own success, and I'm not going to pull any punches! That's all!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... I merely wanted those boys to know that when their shop opened we became rivals, hm? $ENTITY And I warned them that, as they continue to grow, other businesses will try to cut in on their action! $ENTITY I told them they are responsible for their own success, and I'm not going to pull any punches! That's all!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Sure, sure. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY gets it. Throw 'em in the deep end. Teach 'em to swim. Swim with sharks. Bang. But you? Kinder than you seem, I think. I've seen you. Stealthy. Sneakin' out to check on 'em. Bang!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY What?!... I- $ENTITY I was going out for a stroll, hm? I may have peeked in their window, but... it's just business!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Ho ho! Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ! Can it be? The consummate professional? Blushing? $ENTITY Boom!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY . $ENTITY ! Let's chat. You know the $ENTITY GracieGrace $ENTITY boutique? Course you do. $ENTITY Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY took a look. $ENTITY Great place! $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY ? Runs the joint? Great gal. Me? Um... went there for work. Market research. Bang. Sure. $ENTITY Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's familiar. Familiar with fancy shops. Shoppes even. Long time ago. 'Nother life. 'Nother time. Anyway. $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY 's store? Just what I expected. Renowned brand. Quality merchandise. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's impressed! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . If ol' Lyle remembers it right... You and $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY ? Go way back. Right? Sure. Boom.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Anyway. Told her I was with $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY of $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY . That got her going. Couldn't stop gabbin'. $ENTITY Said you two are old pals. Used to get up to shenanigans. $ENTITY You never cease to amaze, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . Bang. ' $ENTITY #x0;
NPC Honma 3P ... Heh heh. That $ENTITY Gracie... She was such a free spirit. She's got a real wild streak, that one, hm? $ENTITY Everyone was always worried about whether or not she'd straighten up and make her way in the world... It's actually quite surprising that she stuck with being a designer lo these many years. I'm very happy for her!
NPC Honma 3P ... Heh heh. That $ENTITY Gracie... She was such a free spirit. She's got a real wild streak, that one, hm? $ENTITY It was really difficult to get it into her head that you need money to live. You need to earn a living! $ENTITY I never imagined that someday she'd be able to get away with charging the prices she does... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ? Blown away. So many secrets. Unexpected. $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY ? A wild child? Who knew? Not me! $ENTITY Hoo! It sure is something. Bang. Learn somethin' new every day. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY I'm just glad to see an old confidant doing so well for herself!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY . $ENTITY ! Question: Ever been to $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY ? Beauty salon? Fix you right up. Bang. $ENTITY Talkin' 'bout a little place you oughta know. Run by $ENTITY Harriet $ENTITY ? Great gal. Great service. Boom. $ENTITY Went for the first time the other day. $ENTITY Felt great! $ENTITY Little fur trim. Whisker wax. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's a new man.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Hmm? Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? You stopped by $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY too! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY can tell!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Everyone who leaves $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY leaves happy. Bang. Refreshed. Boom. Revived. Bam. Revitalized.... Exactly how... Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY looks now.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Hm? Didn't you know? $ENTITY I stop by $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY every day before heading to work. $ENTITY It's the basis of good manners to make oneself aesthetically pleasing. Shows respect for customers, hm?
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Boom! I never knew! Every day? $ENTITY So much effort! So much care! So much our customers don't realize! $ENTITY Floored. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY is floored. Still so much to learn from the master.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well, my dear Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY , it seems you have already learned quite a lot! $ENTITY Deducing from my countenance that I had been to $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY simply amazing! $ENTITY You've really grown! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Shocked. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY is now shocked. Too kind a compliment, sir. I blush. $ENTITY Fact: $ENTITY I learn from you. Daily. $ENTITY Still. $ENTITY Does make a guy feel good to hear you say that, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . Bang!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! ... Club LOL $ENTITY . Do you go often? $ENTITY Lately I've been studying. Yes. Me. Studying. Under the club owner. Name of $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY . $ENTITY Ah. Studying. Might be overselling it a bit. More of a joking situation. $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY teaches me puns. Bam! $ENTITY He's got zingers! Zingers indeed! Keeps Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and me on our toes. Quite a character, that one! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY The other day? We're there on business. Ol' $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY ? Challenges Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY to a joke-off! Boom!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY says, "You've got to have a sense of humor if you want to be a good businessman!" Believe that?... Bitter pill for Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . To get served like that. $ENTITY Fightin' words! I thought it was on! But no dice. $ENTITY #x0;
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Now now, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... You must forget all about that! I simply didn't have enough time to prepare is all!... There's no bad blood. I have a lot of respect for $ENTITY Shrunk... He's an amazing fellow who has accomplished a lot!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Bwaaaaa! I know! $ENTITY I know. Such hardships overcome. Such devotion to jokes! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY respects him, too!... . $ENTITY ! Take note! Funny folks? Examples for all of us. And $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY ? Role model. Truly. Boom.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Now now, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... You must forget all about that! I simply didn't have enough time to prepare is all!... There's no bad blood. I have a lot of respect for $ENTITY Shrunk... He's an amazing fellow who has accomplished a lot! $ENTITY When it comes to customer joy, he's the best of the best! I want to learn his secrets for being loved by all!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Got it! $ENTITY That $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY . Certainly has admirers of all stripes! Go ahead. Count ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY among 'em. Boom! $ENTITY Color my chops busted! Didn't think a would-be joke-off could lead to such serious emotions! Bam!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY . ... Let's chat. $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY . Know him?... Famous musician? Floppy ears? $ENTITY Get this: The other day? Stopped in. The mutt. The myth. The legend. Boom. Right here.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Holding a show that night, wasn't he, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Big show. What a rock star. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY was in awe!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Some insider info: Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Die- hard $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY fan! Familiar with the artist's full discography! No kidding! $ENTITY And his face! When $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY walked through the door? Priceless! So excited! Made ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY chuckle. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... I wasn't that excited! I was merely caught off guard. That's all it was! $ENTITY And anyway... My excitement was rendered ineffectual since you monopolized his time, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY !
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY What?! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ?! A $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY hog?! Never! No way! Not a chance! You... are busting chops again, Mr. $ENTITY Nook... OK. I overdid it a bit... Some history there, though. Worked together ages ago. Had some catching up to do!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY That's it! I can draw on Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's acquaintance with $ENTITY K.K. $ENTITY to help me ingratiate myself with the rock star! $ENTITY It's been my lifelong dream... to get his autograph and have my picture taken with him!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Ha ha ha! We'll see, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . We'll see. Such a fan. Like a teenager! Does ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's heart good! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY . $ENTITY ! You've met $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY The gal? At the post office? Works the night shift? Yes! Right! I'm guessing you've met her. $ENTITY Anyhoo. $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY . Frequent visitor. Stops by here. Afternoon, usually. $ENTITY Says she doesn't like being seen outside of work. Embarrassed when she runs into residents. Little odd. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY But she's here all the time! Isn't that right, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Here all the time. No qualms about it. Boom.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY And... There's her younger sister. $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY ? Works the post office during the day? Right? Right. $ENTITY Get this: $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY . Says she's worried. That $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY might need her for something! So she gets up early! Must be exhausted. Poor girl. Rarely sleeps. Afraid she'll collapse from overdoing it, aren't we, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? $ENTITY #x0;... #x0;
NPC Honma 3P ... That $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY is a total workaholic $ENTITY ! It's like she can't relax unless she's working! That's no way to live! $ENTITY I'm familiar with what it's like to throw oneself into one's work, but her tunnel vision is absurd! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY is being overprotective!... Pelly $ENTITY can handle things on her own! $ENTITY The younger ones can't grow if the older ones meddle too much!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Dangerous ground, though. She'd be upset if we told her that. $ENTITY "Mind your own business!" She'd say that. Bam!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY . $ENTITY ! Question. You've met $ENTITY Celeste $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY Younger sister of $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY ? Works at the museum? Very owly? Right. $ENTITY Get this: Other day. Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and I? Went to the museum. Needed our interior-design expertise. Naturally. $ENTITY But this $ENTITY Celeste $ENTITY ! So inquisitive! And smart! But relentless! On and on with the queries! Yap, yap, yap! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Barrage of questions, right, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Barrage of questions! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ? Busted! Right in the chops!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Started out nice and calm. Sure. Then, bam! Got super excited about home construction! Intensely so! Question after question! Finance, materials, ratings. Happy Home Academy! So many questions!... Blathers $ENTITY finally put a stop to it. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY loves guiding the younger ones. $ENTITY But this one? Exhausting! Boom! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Heh heh. $ENTITY Celeste $ENTITY does love research. I do believe she'd rather study than sleep. I'm impressed, to be honest.... She's been like that ever since she was a tiny owlet, all gab and not much quiet contemplation. $ENTITY But despite how it seems, she is growing up. She's working on her manners. She's just excitable!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Celeste $ENTITY is an odd bird, to be sure. It seems she'd prefer debating to eating three square meals a day!... And $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY is quiet, but he's not shy about correcting someone when he or she needs it. $ENTITY I bet an argument between the two of them would be nothing short of spectacular! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY But we must respect the girl's inquisitiveness, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY . $ENTITY I, for one, enjoy that kind of curiosity!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Little excited here! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ? Invited into the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY the other day! Kaboom! $ENTITY Yes! That very one! Very secret. Rare thing, outsiders getting in. All business. No fooling around! $ENTITY So exciting! So amazing! $ENTITY Can't share any details, though. Strictly confidential. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's not talking!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Can you believe it?! $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY really won't tell me a single thing about what he saw there! I wish I could have gone... It makes you realize just how much clout the $ENTITY HHA $ENTITY has... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Ha ha ha! $ENTITY Oh, Mr. $ENTITY Nook... Me? Clout? You're good at busting ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's chops! So embarrassed! $ENTITY Anyhoo. Not like I was sightseeing... Again. Strictly business. $ENTITY Did get some face time with $ENTITY Resetti $ENTITY himself, though. Quite an honor! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ? A bit starstruck! $ENTITY He's so famous! Everyone knows him. Few get into the inner sanctum. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY feels a bit special. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well, now you're just boasting, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle... `
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Am I?! Oh! So sorry! $ENTITY A bit flustered by all this confidentiality! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's not used to all this!... Guess I got a bit carried away. $ENTITY Bragging like this... In front of the mayor, too! Unforgivable!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Am I?! Oh! So sorry! $ENTITY A bit flustered by all this confidentiality! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's not used to all this!... Got a bit carried away. $ENTITY Guess I'm worried about spilling industry secrets by accident. Better zip it up right now! Boom!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Wow. Let me tell you. Been getting into chess a lot lately. Big time. Student of the game. Serious stuff. $ENTITY Don't you go busting $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's chops! Not ready for tournament play just yet. Just getting warmed up! $ENTITY Thinking man's game, chess. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY ? Not much experience before coming here. A real chess novice. $ENTITY But lately? Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and I? Daily matches. Daily! It's become a habit! Best way to end a work day! Boom!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Isn't that right, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Had quite the heated match the other day. Played long into the night!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY And that Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ! Quite the shark! Shrewd as they come! $ENTITY Started off even greener than ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY . But now? Takes notes! Reads strategy books! Studies up! $ENTITY Even gets mad and busts ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's chops if I take too long to make a move! Very competitive! $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Well, Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY puts too much emphasis on big, showy moves! He takes his time setting them up! $ENTITY Chess is like business... If you take too long in planning, you may suffer when it's time to execute! $ENTITY I'm best at adapting to the circumstances and making little adjustments, building as I go!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY The other day, I thought I'd finally win a match against him, but... then I accidentally tipped the board over. All those moves I played to get so close to victory were wasted... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Anyhoo. Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY has to be careful. Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY is getting better and better! $ENTITY No careless moves for me!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Heh. Havin' one of those "awwww" moments right now. Thinking about a good thing that happened to me. $ENTITY So. I have two daughters. Younger one comes by the store. Just to see me! Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's buttons popped off! $ENTITY Said she just wanted to watch me at work. Study her pop. Take some notes. Made ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY so proud!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Good day for it, too, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ! You had gone out for a bit. Put ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY in charge! Made me look good!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Used to switch jobs a lot. When the girls were younger. Put a little bit of stress on the ol' family... So. This job? Decided to stick it out. Make it work. Make a go of it. So glad I did!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Ho ho! Let me tell you! When I came back from running my errands that day... I thought I was seeing double!... Lyle $ENTITY 's daughter really looks just like a little $ENTITY Lyle... It's amazing how powerful genetics can be... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Heh heh. Well. When the girls were younger? Didn't care to hear that. Didn't want to look like the ol' man!... Said they wanted to look like little thems. Not little mes. Guess ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY can understand that... But now? We all look back on those days and laugh. Laugh out loud. Laugh together! Good times. Boom. $ENTITY 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Little surprise the other day. $ENTITY ? Loaded us up with treats! Tasty, tasty treats! $ENTITY I've been wanting a quality $ENTITY , to be honest. $ENTITY family sent some good ones! Bam! $ENTITY Not particularly scarce in these parts, but still! Hard to turn down a fine $ENTITY . Right? Right!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Excellent, weren't they, Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Everyone who tried ... sang its praises!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY No way we could eat 'em all. So we took 'em out. Shared 'em with our shopping-district pals. Glad to do it! $ENTITY Took some to the Able sisters. Some to $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY . And, of course, some to... #x0;~
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY and $ENTITY Harriet... We just had to share with them! Everyone who got one was happy and satisfied!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY and $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY ! We just had to share with them! Everyone who got one was happy and satisfied!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY and $ENTITY Phyllis... We just had to share with them! Everyone who got one was happy and satisfied!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY We business folks? Gotta stick together! Support each other! Keep each other going! Bang! $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY and I? Happy to share! Our business? Only works when we all happily attract customers!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Those Able sisters. Must enjoy working. Hardly ever take a break!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Hoo! That weed-pulling contest! Got to see a side of $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY I've never seen before! Bang!
NPC Honma 3P Heh. Little confession: still can't tell $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY apart sometimes... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Yep. GracieGrace brand furniture. Pretty much anyone would be lucky to have some. $ENTITY And $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY ? Quite the amazing person! Quality crafter all the way. Love it!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Shampoodle $ENTITY . Popular place. Lot of it has to do with $ENTITY Harriet $ENTITY 's winning personality. Simple truth. $ENTITY And what a cheerful voice! Makes ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY feel like he can do anything! Climb oceans! Swim mountains!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Funny when you think about it: Some folks? Visit $ENTITY Club LOL $ENTITY never knowing $ENTITY Shrunk $ENTITY 's comedy chops. $ENTITY Me? Amazed! What a history!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Bit of $ENTITY K.K. Slider $ENTITY insider info: $ENTITY Song requests? Anything you wanna hear Saturdays? He said to let him know! $ENTITY Gives me an idea! Think I'll take my daughters to a show! Boom!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Think I can learn from $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY . Learn how to take work a bit more seriously. Nose to the grindstone! $ENTITY But... Better not say that to her. Bet she'd get mad at ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY . Bust chops like there's no tomorrow!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY . $ENTITY Celeste $ENTITY . Boom. Get along really well for siblings. Nice to see. $ENTITY Still. Sometimes. Feels like 'ol $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY needs a PhD to talk to 'em... 
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Wow. $ENTITY Resetti $ENTITY . So much I can't talk about. Gonna bury the secrets deep. Might burst, though. Might burst!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Gotta watch out for Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY . Becoming a chess master, that one! $ENTITY Wouldn't be surprised to see him with a custom set. Wouldn't be surprised at all!
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY Everyone in my family looks the same. Lots of folks think it. Quite a few even say it! $ENTITY My daughters? Kind of gotten used to it. Took a while, though! $ENTITY Ol' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY thinks there's still some resentment.
NPC Honma 3P $ENTITY This shop? Customer friendly. Folks stop by. Just to chat. All the time! $ENTITY And, $ENTITY ? Stop by anytime! Feel free!
