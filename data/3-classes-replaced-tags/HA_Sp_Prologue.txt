HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY Here's a workout that really pays off: $ENTITY face a tree with fruit on it, and press to shake it like crazy! $ENTITY The fruit will drop, and you can $ENTITY pick it up by pressing ! $ENTITY Shake, bend, pick up! $ENTITY It's great cardio! $ENTITY Try picking up other stuff besides fruit too! ... Aaaaand, $ENTITY stuff you pick up... you can sell to $ENTITY Re-Tail... If you need some extra spending money, this is the way to go! $ENTITY Cardio and cash! $ENTITY !
HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY I'm at the alpacas' Re-Tail shop all the time! $ENTITY I sell them my furniture, $ENTITY clothes, $ENTITY fruit, $ENTITY shells... I think they would buy just about anything if you took it to them! $ENTITY Sometimes I just sell everything in my house so I can replace it all with new stuff! $ENTITY Moving stuff is quite the workout, you know! $ENTITY I wish I could move all my stuff every day! $ENTITY Anyway, stop by $ENTITY Re-Tail... and check it out, $ENTITY !
HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY OK, listen up! $ENTITY I've got some things to tell you about tools! $ENTITY Pay attention! $ENTITY First of all, $ENTITY you need a $ENTITY net $ENTITY if you want to catch bugs! $ENTITY Next, $ENTITY you should get a $ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY ! I know it's obvious, but I have to say it... You catch fish with it! $ENTITY Last is a... shovel... Use a shovel to dig at a you see on the ground. $ENTITY All kinds of stuff might be buried at those spots. $ENTITY Fossils, treasure... Who knows what you'll dig up? $ENTITY Anyhoo, when you get stuff with a $ENTITY net $ENTITY , $ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY , or $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY , you might want to sell it at the recycle shop... Heh heh! $ENTITY You don't have to sell, but it's a good way to make some money, ... I $ENTITY #x0;
HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY I need your opinion about something.... Be honest! $ENTITY 
HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY So where did you build your house?... Nearby. Over there. Way over there.

Check out your pictures in $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS Camera... Then you can admire pictures of me $ENTITY anytime you want! ... 
HA Sp Prologue Oh, great. $ENTITY I don't really know what this means, but I think I fell asleep without saving... When I woke up the next day, $ENTITY I couldn't remember anything that happened the day before... When you want to save, $ENTITY press $ENTITY START $ENTITY and then select $ENTITY Save and continue $ENTITY ! Or $ENTITY Save and quit... I really need to make sure I don't forget to save either, $ENTITY .
HA Sp Prologue $ENTITY A lot of people don't know this, but mayors need to be really buff... Like, $ENTITY superhero buff. $ENTITY You're really lucky to have me here $ENTITY giving you pointers about all the physical demands of mayorhood. $ENTITY I'm happy to be kind of a buffness advisor to Your Honor, but... yeah...
