ZK Q03 Req So there's something I'd like your help with. $ENTITY I want to send a boost of confidence to, uh.... the future me. $ENTITY I wrote myself a confident note and put it in this $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY along with a gift, $ENTITY . Could you bury this in $ENTITY somewhere? $ENTITY Sure. Why not? Sorry, no.
ZK Q03 Req Hey, I'd like your help with a secret mission, $ENTITY . It involves the future me. $ENTITY You see, once in a while I lose my confidence, and a kind word really goes a long way, $ENTITY . So I want to have a nice note ready for my future self. $ENTITY I've put that and a gift in this $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY . $ENTITY Could you bury it somewhere here in ... Wow, sure! Sorry, but I can't.
ZK Q03 Req I wonder if you'd help me out.... now AND in the future? $ENTITY You see, in the future, I'll need a note of encouragement. $ENTITY So I wrote one earlier, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I put it in a $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY along with a gift. $ENTITY What I need you to do is bury it in $ENTITY . $ENTITY Will you do it? $ENTITY Of course! Sorry, no.
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Thanks. That's really nice, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY You'll do it? $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY !
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Thanks for helping, ... Glad to know that capsule is as good as buried, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req You won't help? $ENTITY Well, maybe another time, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Now be sure to bury the capsule, $ENTITY , OK? You'll find it with the rest of your $ENTITY letters $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Oh, but don't open it. $ENTITY It's super secret, $ENTITY so no looky!
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY So remember that time capsule I asked you to bury?... Well, it hasn't been buried, has it? $ENTITY Can you just give it back? $ENTITY I'm going to ask someone else to take care of it for me.
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? Did you lose my time capsule, ... But that was really important to me, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You opened the capsule, didn't you, ... Heh. Couldn't resist prying into my secrets, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req Well, that's too bad. $ENTITY I thought I could trust you with that, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY That's not what I was hoping would happen, $ENTITY !
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Wait! $ENTITY You already opened it, didn't you, ... #xE; I wanted to do that together with you!
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You opened it? And you don't have what was inside? I thought I could count on you.
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Thanks for not looking inside yet! $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY how about we open this together, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Well, look at this, ... It's ... I almost forgot that's what I put inside.... Now, what was written in that note of mine?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What did I stick inside? $ENTITY It's ... Heh. That's right. $ENTITY I put something in on a whim! $ENTITY OK, what was on that note I wrote?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? Did I really put this in there? ... Well, I guess I did. $ENTITY I thought I'd just misplaced my stuff! $ENTITY OK, so how about the note I put in there...?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY It's a little weird reading that all this time later, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Well, how about you take what was in the capsule as a gift, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Wait! I have to thank you!... Uh, $ENTITY how about you take this, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Well, I'd like to give you a thank-you gift, but your pockets seem to be full, $ENTITY . I'll send it to you later, $ENTITY , OK?
ZK Q03 Req It's ... Thank you, ... I feel like the bonds of our friendship have just grown stronger... 
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Heh. The old bait and switch, huh, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Hey, that's the capsule you buried for me, right? I was just thinking about asking you to dig it up! $ENTITY Hold on. Did you open it already? $ENTITY I was hoping to look inside together, $ENTITY !
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Hey, did you dig up that capsule I had you bury? I was just thinking about asking you to get it! $ENTITY Wait. Did you already open it? AND you took out the contents? $ENTITY I wanted to do all that WITH you.
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Hey, that's the capsule you buried for me, right? I was just thinking about asking you to dig it up! $ENTITY Well then, you know what time it is, ... Time to open the capsule together!
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Well, just look at this, $ENTITY . It's ... I almost forgot what I'd put inside. $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY what did I write in my note?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY So what did I stuff inside there?... It's ... Heh. That's right. I guess that's what I put in there! $ENTITY Hmm. Now, what was on that note I wrote?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? I actually put THIS in there? ... I guess I did.... I thought I'd just lost my stuff! $ENTITY Well then, how about that note I tucked inside?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Wow, that's a pretty good piece of writing, $ENTITY .
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY OK, how about you take what I put in the capsule as a thank-you, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY Oh, what can I give you in return for all your work? $ENTITY How about this, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY I'd like to give you something as thanks for all your work, but your pockets are full, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'll send it to you later, $ENTITY !
ZK Q03 Req It's $ENTITY I feel like we've gotten to know each other better through this little quest!
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You opened this without my permission, $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY but you have to give it back immediately, $ENTITY !
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY I'll forgive you this time, though, because you were honest about it. $ENTITY That fair, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You lost what was inside? $ENTITY Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have asked you to do all this,... so don't worry about it right now. But next time $ENTITY stick with the plan, OK, $ENTITY ?
ZK Q03 Req $ENTITY What? $ENTITY The capsule has been opened! $ENTITY And there's nothing inside, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So much for time capsules, I guess. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY whatever.
