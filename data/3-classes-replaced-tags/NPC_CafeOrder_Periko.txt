NPC CafeOrder Periko A coffee, please!... With the usual flavor, if you could.
NPC CafeOrder Periko A coffee, please!... Blended $ENTITY , if you could.
NPC CafeOrder Periko A coffee, please!... With $ENTITY only a little bit of milk $ENTITY in it, if you could.
NPC CafeOrder Periko A coffee, please!... With $ENTITY 1 spoonful of sugar $ENTITY , if you could.
NPC CafeOrder Periko $ENTITY Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko $ENTITY Oh my! It smells great!... Thank you so much.
NPC CafeOrder Periko $ENTITY Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing $ENTITY . $ENTITY I usually only drink $ENTITY blended coffee $ENTITY , so I got a little surprised is all. Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko $ENTITY Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing $ENTITY . $ENTITY I guess I forgot to ask for $ENTITY only a little bit of milk $ENTITY to be added to the coffee. My mistake! Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko $ENTITY Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing.... I'm used to my coffee having $ENTITY 1 spoonful of sugar... so I got a little surprised is all. Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing!... The coffee just smells a bit different than I'm used to, so it surprised me is all. Even if it's blended, having different amounts of $ENTITY milk $ENTITY and $ENTITY sugar $ENTITY would change the flavor, or so I'd assume. Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing!... I was expecting my usual coffee and was surprised is all. Even though it has milk, I guess the flavor changes when the amount of $ENTITY sugar $ENTITY or type of $ENTITY bean $ENTITY is different. Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing!... I thought it was the same coffee as usual, but the smell was new and I got surprised. Coffee is coffee, but I guess it can smell different if the amount of $ENTITY milk $ENTITY or type of $ENTITY bean $ENTITY is changed. Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
NPC CafeOrder Periko Oh... Uh, no,... it's nothing! $ENTITY I was expecting my usual coffee, but it smelled a lot different, so I got surprised... That's understandable, though, since I didn't place my order with details. $ENTITY My mistake! Well, I'll see you later. Thank you!
