FU 3P Ot $ENTITY I've, um, $ENTITY always admired you. $ENTITY I think you're very wise, $ENTITY .
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Well! $ENTITY Thank you for that. $ENTITY I believe it's my responsibility to act as a role model for your generation.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY I've learned a lot from you already. $ENTITY But how do I seem more mature?
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY You're already mature for your age. $ENTITY My suggestion is to just be yourself.... Don't change to impress others. $ENTITY Explore all the things that make you happy now, $ENTITY and you'll discover what you really want out of life later.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Having goals is important... But don't be so focused on them that you forget to have fun too.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY How to seem more mature... Eat lots of vegetables. $ENTITY They're good for you, $ENTITY and it helps keep the carrot population under control.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Thanks,... I can always count on you for the best advice. $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY I'm getting an etiquette lesson from $ENTITY today. $ENTITY What's the first thing I should know, $ENTITY ma'am?
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY 
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY It's nice that you're so polite, $ENTITY but you can still call me ... The first thing you should work on is expressing your opinion in a diplomatic manner. $ENTITY If I am offered anchovies, $ENTITY I will say: "No thank you. $ENTITY I do not care for anchovies." Now you try telling me that you don't want something.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY No, thank you. $ENTITY I do not want any magazine subscriptions.... How was that? $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , you should try it. $ENTITY No, thank you. No, thanks, dork.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Very nice, $ENTITY both of you. $ENTITY I think that's enough school for today.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Thank you! $ENTITY I'm going to go practice diplomacy at all the stores in town.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY That's just... I suppose there's some room for creativity. $ENTITY Just don't tell anyone I taught you that.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Wow, $ENTITY I could never get away with that!... Wait. $ENTITY Who're you calling a dork, $ENTITY ?
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY It's nice that you're so polite, $ENTITY but you can still call me ... The first thing we should work on is the proper way to thank someone. $ENTITY Look him or her in the eyes, and say $ENTITY "thank you very much" $ENTITY in a warm tone of voice. $ENTITY Now you try it.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Thank you very much $ENTITY for the only-slightly-burned cookies.... How was that? $ENTITY Thank you kindly! Arigatou!
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY You both did well. $ENTITY I'd say you've completed your first lesson on manners!
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Thank you most kindly for the lesson.... Hee hee!
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Oh... Well, $ENTITY if you ever visit Japan, $ENTITY you know how to say "thank you."
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY That's pretty neat!... You're going to be a world traveler,... 
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Have you read my letter yet?
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY thank you for writing me such an informative letter.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY To be honest, I had to rewrite it a few times. $ENTITY It wasn't easy to explain in a letter, $ENTITY so I'm glad you understood what I was trying to say.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY #x0;
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY It took me a while to understand the section about " $ENTITY without $ENTITY ."
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY I did have trouble with one section... "A new approach: $ENTITY Using $ENTITY to attract slugs." $ENTITY It was a little... outside the scope of my interests.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY You certainly caught my attention with the section about $ENTITY "Using ... in $ENTITY ."
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY I'm glad you took the time to read that! $ENTITY It's been the subject of much of my recent research! I'd be happy to explain it in more detail, $ENTITY if you'd like.
FU 3P Ot $ENTITY Your enthusiasm is catching. $ENTITY Maybe we can discuss it later.
