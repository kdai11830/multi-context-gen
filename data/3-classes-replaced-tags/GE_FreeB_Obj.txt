GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY Just between you and me... One day, I'm gonna sit on the town's $ENTITY ... $ENTITY and just wait for a passing talent agent to snatch me up! $ENTITY That's how all the big stars are discovered!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY I should totally stand next to our town's $ENTITY and wait until someone says to me: $ENTITY "Five minutes to curtain, Ms. $ENTITY !" And then I'll be all like, $ENTITY "Don't rush me! I'm a star!"
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY If you're going to have a fight with someone, you should do it under the town's $ENTITY . $ENTITY That way, it'll look like something out of a movie! $ENTITY Lights, camera, and drama! Hahaha!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY No more wandering around in the dark, thanks to our town's super- helpful $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I could totally, like, hang out there all day and all night!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY , huh? I wonder what that sign is trying to tell me!... I wish it could talk!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY Yay! Every time I see $ENTITY 's $ENTITY , I think there's a party going on! $ENTITY So fun!
GE FreeB Obj Our town's $ENTITY would be the perfect place to air one of my concerts! $ENTITY Everyone in town would love it!... Note to self: make this happen!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY Did you know if you ring the town's $ENTITY and say your crush's name three times... $ENTITY you'll be madly in love for, like, the rest of your lives?... True story. $ENTITY Or not. $ENTITY I just made it up.
GE FreeB Obj The more I look at our town's $ENTITY , the more I think it was modeled after me! $ENTITY It's practically like looking in a mirror! The artist really captured my inner glow, $ENTITY !
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY That $ENTITY would make the perfect audience member! $ENTITY I could sing for it all day, and it'd never fall asleep! $ENTITY Unlike some other audience members I know...
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY I've always wondered what that $ENTITY is picking up and sending out to the world. $ENTITY Wouldn't it be, like, totally weird if someone out there was watching your every move? $ENTITY Creeeeeeeepy!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY How I'd love to lie down on that $ENTITY and soak up the sun... But too much sun causes wrinkles, and $ENTITY must always take care of herself, $ENTITY .
GE FreeB Obj One time, I spun around on our town's $ENTITY so much, I got sick to my stomach. $ENTITY But you mustn't blame the poor $ENTITY ! $ENTITY To be fair, I was on it for, like, 3 hours.
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY You know, sometimes I climb up on the town's $ENTITY and practice singing my solos! $ENTITY There are, like, awesome acoustics up there! $ENTITY La la la la la!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY Our town's $ENTITY and I look good together, don't you think? $ENTITY I'm not surprised. $ENTITY Not a day goes by when someone doesn't mistake me for a goddess of the desert!
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY I saw $ENTITY hanging out by the town's $ENTITY the other day. ... #x0; waited for hours... $ENTITY But no one ever showed up. I wonder what that was all about.
GE FreeB Obj $ENTITY I love taking a deep breath next to the town's $ENTITY . $ENTITY So pretty, and it smells good too! $ENTITY Aromatherapy is, like, the best, $ENTITY .
