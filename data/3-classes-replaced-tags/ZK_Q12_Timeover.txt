ZK Q12 Timeover Hey, about the signatures regarding $ENTITY from the other day... The deadline was coming up quick... Well, we didn't reach our goal, $ENTITY but I decided to submit it just the same. $ENTITY Therefore, $ENTITY I don't need your help collecting signatures anymore, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I also don't need the paper either, $ENTITY so feel free to just throw it away,... .
ZK Q12 Timeover $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY About the signatures for ... Actually, $ENTITY , I submitted it without waiting for your signatures. $ENTITY It's partially my fault for asking you to help right before the deadline... So $ENTITY I suppose the paper I gave you won't be necessary anymore, $ENTITY so you can just get rid of it if you want to.
ZK Q12 Timeover ... I have something I need to apologize to you about... I already submitted the signatures for ... even after asking you for help. $ENTITY It was partially my fault for asking you to do it just a short time before the deadline hit... Anyway, that paper doesn't have a purpose anymore, $ENTITY so can you throw it away for me?
