NPC Cafe Reset What's up? $ENTITY You need something?
NPC Cafe Reset You again, huh?... Well, don't just stand there. $ENTITY Find a seat and have some coffee already!
NPC Cafe Reset You again! $ENTITY I've been seein' your face a whole lot lately!
NPC Cafe Reset When it comes to coffee, $ENTITY I don't drink anything other than $ENTITY Blue Mountain... That's it! For aroma, $ENTITY richness, $ENTITY and sweetness,... there's nothing even close to better than Blue Mountain beans! $ENTITY Er, $ENTITY I mean we all have different tastes, $ENTITY so I suppose I could see how you might like something else.
NPC Cafe Reset Adding milk to your coffee... ends up spoiling its aroma and taste. $ENTITY Coffee is best with $ENTITY no $ENTITY milk!... Yeah, yeah, $ENTITY I don't mean to say anything about how you drink your coffee. $ENTITY Even though I already did.
NPC Cafe Reset Sugar in your coffee?... No way $ENTITY ! You CRAZY?! $ENTITY You use something like that, $ENTITY you won't be able to taste the natural sweetness of your coffee! $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY maybe you're the kind that needs your coffee even sweeter. $ENTITY To each 'is own, I suppose.
NPC Cafe Reset Nowadays,... there are WAY too many grown-ups who do pretty much anything they're told to do! $ENTITY Can you even imagine the chaos that occurs if a bunch of older guys start doin' stuff the young guys say? $ENTITY There are times you gotta stick to your own beliefs, $ENTITY even if you know you're in the wrong. $ENTITY I wanna continue being that kind of opinionated old man people usually tend to avoid. $ENTITY That's for me!
NPC Cafe Reset " $ENTITY Mr. Resetti... he's always angry and just yells at people... $ENTITY "But that $ENTITY Don Resetti $ENTITY , he's always calm,... peaceful, $ENTITY and friendly to everybody he meets... ." $ENTITY That's probably what you think of us, $ENTITY huh?... But that ain't right! $ENTITY My brother is very persistent when he gives his endless lectures! $ENTITY Ever been lectured for two hours long? Yeah, even I'm not THAT bad! $ENTITY In the end, $ENTITY you'll probably forget why you were even being lectured in the first place! I'm just sayin', $ENTITY ya shouldn't judge a book by its cover! And that goes DOUBLE for moles!
NPC Cafe Reset When a mole moves through the ground by diggin' a tunnel, $ENTITY it's actually slower than a snail moving. $ENTITY You ever heard that before? $ENTITY I've never actually raced a snail to find out,... so I don't know if it's true or not... . $ENTITY But just think about it! $ENTITY I'm diggin' a tunnel through DIRT and ROCKS, while the snail's just MOVIN'! $ENTITY It's nonsense to compare us! Diggin' a hole wide enough $ENTITY to pass through with a pickax is HARD!... By the way, $ENTITY I already dug a tunnel to your house, $ENTITY so in case I need to,... I can be there in an INSTANT! $ENTITY I plan for every eventuality!
