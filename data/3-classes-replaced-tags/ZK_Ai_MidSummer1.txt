ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY So, $ENTITY like the sun, ... It's going to stick around a lot longer today, $ENTITY . Just like it does every $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY . Should make for a really topsy-turvy sort of day.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY here's a bright idea, $ENTITY I think. $ENTITY If today's the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY , and the sun isn't going down... We should eat breakfast for lunch. $ENTITY And dinner. $ENTITY Right, $ENTITY ?
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I'm a big fan of the sun in general. $ENTITY But not really on the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY . $ENTITY The sun's going to be around for a lot longer today. $ENTITY No one likes a guest that outstays their welcome.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY So here we are, $ENTITY right in middle of the day, $ENTITY right, ... Well, not today, if you think about it. $ENTITY The $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY stretches the daylight way longer today than ever. $ENTITY Like taffy. $ENTITY Or gum. $ENTITY Could get sticky.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY We've got hours $ENTITY and hours $ENTITY and hours of sunlight ahead of us, $ENTITY . Normally, $ENTITY I'm all cool like a helping of $ENTITY cheese, $ENTITY but I'm going to melt $ENTITY all $ENTITY over $ENTITY the $ENTITY place $ENTITY soon...
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY Hey, good afternoon, ... It's still afternoon, $ENTITY right? I lose my bearings on the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY . $ENTITY It's all this extra summer in my head today. $ENTITY Everything feels like noon. I know. $ENTITY Crazy, $ENTITY .
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY nighttime is usually my chill-out time. But well, today's the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I guess I'm going to have to stay in $ENTITY overdrive tonight, $ENTITY !
ZK Ai MidSummer1 Hey, $ENTITY liking this day-night stuff? Yeah, everything runs together for me during the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY . I barely know what time it is.... Am $ENTITY I $ENTITY sleepy...? $ENTITY Or just waking up? $ENTITY Not cool, $ENTITY solstice.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY Good eventide, ... Finding the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY to your liking, ... ila $ENTITY #x0;? ... $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY enough of that. $ENTITY I indulge in a little medieval talk once a year. Just to get it out of my system.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY So the sun is STILL out? At this time of night, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY The $ENTITY Summer Solstice... is $ENTITY nuts.
ZK Ai MidSummer1 $ENTITY Sunlight at night? Goes together about as well as $ENTITY and $ENTITY ... $ENTITY But I suppose SOME people might think that sounds pretty tasty, $ENTITY .
