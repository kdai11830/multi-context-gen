The other day this guy comes by wanting me to sign up for his new $ENTITY venture. $ENTITY I was like, "Sorry, bro!

HA FreeA Always $ENTITY Run, run, run! Run until you're completely tuckered out! $ENTITY For me, there's this moment when I think I can't take any more. $ENTITY And then I get a surge of energy! $ENTITY It's called runner's high.... It's the coolest thing ever!

Or maybe I was just dizzy after cartwheeling all over the place. $ENTITY !
HA FreeA Always $ENTITY What is it with prim and proper ladies anyway, ... Is it true they don't like to sweat? That's terrible, $ENTITY !
