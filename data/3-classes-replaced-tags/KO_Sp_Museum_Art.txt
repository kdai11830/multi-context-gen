KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Hey, ... Don't you think this room is kind of empty and sort of lonely? $ENTITY With such a small collection, $ENTITY I don't know if you can even call it the art wing of the museum!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Yeah, I really don't know the first thing about fine art.
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY I heard that one time they hung a painting upside down and nobody realized it for a whole year.
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Before I knew it, this place got itself a decent collection going!... I'm impressed!
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Having a complete collection really doesn't make us better than other towns, but it still feels pretty nice! $ENTITY This art collection is the pride and joy of everyone in ... Even me, and I don't even "get" art!
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Oh,... Do me a favor, and don't look at this room too much! $ENTITY They've only just begun to collect artwork, so it's practically empty!
KO Sp Museum_Art They still don't have much of an art collection going on here. $ENTITY But this isn't the kind of thing you can just put together with hard work! It takes time too!
KO Sp Museum_Art Between your town and this one,... which do you think has the better art collection? $ENTITY Yeah, I agree.... Probably ours.
KO Sp Museum_Art $ENTITY Our collection here is pretty darn complete, don't you think? $ENTITY At this rate, $ENTITY we'll have a complete collection in a matter of days! $ENTITY I just gotta paint a bit!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Sp Museum_Art What's the art collection $ENTITY like in your town? Is it this nice? $ENTITY Not to brag or anything, but our town's collection is perfect!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY
