OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? $ENTITY is giving this to me, ... Hmm. A gift from $ENTITY right out of the blue.... You always have to wonder with ... #x0;... 
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? $ENTITY A present from ... I bet I know what THIS is all about, $ENTITY ! We had an argument over, $ENTITY oh, $ENTITY I can't even remember what anymore. $ENTITY Ugh, $ENTITY now I feel so awful.... smoothed things over before I did? Now I look like I'm being petty.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh, it's the $ENTITY I lent $ENTITY ! I never thought I'd ever get it back!
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh, it's the $ENTITY I lost! $ENTITY And $ENTITY sent it over? $ENTITY I knew it was over there!
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? My package was delivered to $ENTITY by accident? $ENTITY But, wait. Did $ENTITY open it? $ENTITY That was me. Er, I don't know.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh, this must be that special thing I asked $ENTITY to get for me. $ENTITY But, $ENTITY wait. $ENTITY Has it been opened? $ENTITY Actually, I did it. Um, who knows?
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Thank you for the delivery, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Thank you for making this delivery,... . $ENTITY I think $ENTITY and I can patch things up now.
OT Q06 B_Open But hold on.... 
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY It isn't very well wrapped. I mean, I'd even say it looks like it was attacked by a swarm of bees. $ENTITY I opened it. Definitely bees.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY those darn bees! $ENTITY They probably thought you were carrying $ENTITY in there.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY It's very nice of you to agree with me, but I know it was really $ENTITY 's sloppy wrapping. $ENTITY Still, a gift is a gift. I'm just glad $ENTITY was that thoughtful.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY No! $ENTITY You? $ENTITY But I thought you were sweet as ... But if there's one thing I appreciate, $ENTITY it's someone who comes clean when they're in the wrong.
OT Q06 B_Open But I may not be so kind next time, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I hope we have an $ENTITY un $ENTITY der $ENTITY stan $ENTITY ding.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY And you did go to all the trouble of delivering it to me. I guess I do owe you for that.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I must be feeling generous today. $ENTITY But please, the next time you deliver something.... ? $ENTITY Don't open it, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I don't mean to be fussy, but it would have been nice if this came back all nicely wrapped. $ENTITY Really, it's like everyone in this town was raised by animals.... Well, $ENTITY so to speak. $ENTITY Anyway, thanks for making the delivery, $ENTITY . At least I can always count on you.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Thank you so much for delivering it. And please send back my thanks too, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY I thought I'd never get it back. Thanks so much, $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Open Hmm. But I thought it was gone forever, so I bought a new one.
OT Q06 B_Open Well, that's about as suspicious as bees on ... But thanks anyway for delivering the package, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY What? You opened the package? That's so unlike you! $ENTITY But as they say, $ENTITY is never as sweet behind your back.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Still, you're pretty sweet MOST of the time, so I forgive you. $ENTITY And, surprise, surprise.... I actually got this for you! Here. It's $ENTITY !
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY didn't this all turn out so strangely. You surprised me. I surprised you! But next time,... , $ENTITY I suggest that you not just open other people's packages so willy-nilly.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Still, you're sweet most of the time. So let's never mention this ugly matter ever again, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Still, you're sweet most of the time. $ENTITY And since you're one of my favorites, let's just forget this.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY Besides, you did tell me you opened it, $ENTITY .
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY But at least it was very sweet of you to confess what you did. $ENTITY Let's just forget about it.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY But next time.... Well, $ENTITY I'm sure there won't BE a next time,... .
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY And you did go to all the trouble of delivering the package. So I guess I owe you something.
OT Q06 B_Open $ENTITY It's $ENTITY Enjoy the gift. And just remember what we talked about, OK?
