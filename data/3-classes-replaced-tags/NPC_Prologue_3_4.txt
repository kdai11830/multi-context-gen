NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Ah, hello! $ENTITY Welcome! Welcome!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY You must be the new mayor, $ENTITY am I right?... Isabelle $ENTITY at the town hall told me to expect you! $ENTITY On behalf of the $ENTITY chamber of commerce, $ENTITY I'm pleased to welcome you!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Ah, $ENTITY you must be $ENTITY the newest resident of our little town. $ENTITY It's $ENTITY , yes? I heard about you from $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY at the town hall a short while ago!
NPC Prologue 3_4 So, ... You're here today because you want to build a house, $ENTITY yes? $ENTITY Very good! Very good! $ENTITY I can build one just about anywhere you want, yes, I can indeed! $ENTITY 
NPC Prologue 3_4 Ah, $ENTITY and you want to move here, $ENTITY hm? $ENTITY Do you have a home and belongings from your previous town? $ENTITY If so, $ENTITY once you pick where you want to live, $ENTITY I can take care of the rest!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY So $ENTITY have you decided on where you want to live? $ENTITY Yep! Not yet.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Then this won't take long at all! $ENTITY Just take me where you want to build your new home, $ENTITY !
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Color me unsurprised!... You DID just move here, after all, and there's no sense rushing into anything! I understand completely! $ENTITY Take your time to walk around town and find that perfect place. I will follow you, $ENTITY so if anything strikes your fancy, please tell me!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I must head back to my shop, $ENTITY so here is where our ways part. $ENTITY , you need to head back to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY now $ENTITY , do you not? $ENTITY Now that your residence is secured, $ENTITY you must get this information registered at once! Yes, yes! $ENTITY I'll work out the numbers in the meantime, so come by my shop tomorrow or the day after. $ENTITY Thanks for your business! $ENTITY I rather appreciate it! Hm, yes, yes!
NPC Prologue 3_4 Hey! $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Focus! $ENTITY This isn't the time for dawdling. $ENTITY You need to find a place to live, yes?
NPC Prologue 3_4 That's the way to the beach! $ENTITY You can't build a house on sand!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Please wait! $ENTITY 
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Wait one moment! $ENTITY You can't live in the shopping district. $ENTITY Find a spot of land on this side, yes?
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Thanks for waiting! $ENTITY We've relocated it! Inside and out, it's just as it was before your stressful move. $ENTITY That reminds me! I'll make sure that $ENTITY the $ENTITY Happy Home Academy $ENTITY has been updated with your new address. $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY I must head back to my shop, $ENTITY so I'll say my good-byes for now. $ENTITY , you'll be heading back to the town hall $ENTITY after this, hm? $ENTITY Now that you have a place to live, $ENTITY you must take care of your resident registration, oh, yes, yes! $ENTITY Well then, thank you for using $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY for all your housing needs!... I do so appreciate it!
NPC Prologue 3_4 Yes, yes! $ENTITY So you would like to $ENTITY build your house here? $ENTITY Yep! Here! No.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY That's perfectly fine! $ENTITY Please take your time. $ENTITY There's no rush at all.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hm, yes, to give you an idea of how much space you need for building your new house... . $ENTITY From where you're standing now, you'd need to be able to take about $ENTITY four $ENTITY steps left, right, and back. $ENTITY Without that much space, even if you planned to expand in the future, you wouldn't be able to do so.... We can move plants and trees when doing the construction, but we can't move rocks or buildings, no, no. $ENTITY When you're looking for a place to build, $ENTITY please keep that in mind, hm?
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmmmm... No, no. This is too close to a public works project. $ENTITY I'm sorry, so very sorry, but you don't have enough space to build a home here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmmm... No, no. This is too close to another planned building. $ENTITY I'm sorry, so very sorry, but you don't have enough space to build a home here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmmmm... We'd have to tear down a public works project, but if that's OK, I think we can build here, yes.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmmmm... We'd have to tear down some public works projects, but if that's OK, I think we can build here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Yes, yes. $ENTITY There's plenty of space to build a house here!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the town hall, so it's just the spot for you, mayor.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the town hall, so it's very convenient!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the train station and shopping area, $ENTITY so it's really convenient if you like to shop!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the beach. $ENTITY It's a dream location if you like the ocean.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the recycle shop, $ENTITY so it's convenient if you like changing up your home's look.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the caf, $ENTITY so it's perfect if you like coffee!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And it's close to the police station, $ENTITY so you don't have to worry about safety.... I think... .
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And there are plenty of neighbors nearby, $ENTITY so it's the perfect place for socializing!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And there's a river nearby. $ENTITY If you like fishing or being in nature, it's the perfect spot!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And there's a space nearby for festivals and events!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Oh, yes, yes! This spot is really close to the train tracks, so I'd highly suggest it to railroading fans!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY And there aren't many buildings around, $ENTITY so it's perfect for those who like peace and quiet!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... This spot is too close to the river to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... This spot is too close to the pond to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... This spot is too close to the cliff to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Umm... This space is too close to your neighbors, $ENTITY so there isn't enough room for a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... Looks like ... is in the way, so we can't build here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... This spot is too close to the train tracks to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Umm... This area has a large rock in the way, so there is no room to build your home, no, no!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hmm... This spot is too close to the plaza to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Umm... There is another building nearby, so there isn't enough room for your house here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY A different space would be a better choice. $ENTITY There isn't enough room here to accommodate potential future remodels.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Hold on a moment. $ENTITY Let's see... It will look something like this... .
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY We'll need to move trees, flowers, and any buried items in order to start building. $ENTITY But if you're OK with that, we can start right away!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY So? $ENTITY Does this location suit your needs? Hm? $ENTITY Yep! Hang on a sec...
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY That's quite fine. $ENTITY Take your time.
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY OK! $ENTITY It's decided then! $ENTITY It will take a bit of time to build your house, so for today, let's reserve the space for you... There we go! Yes, yes! Wonderful!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Ta-da! $ENTITY And with that, this space is officially yours, ... Umm, $ENTITY including the cost of the land, materials, building costs, $ENTITY et cetera... Well, the calculation is complicated, so I can't come up with it just now. $ENTITY I'll tell you the total later. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I'm sure you're very busy, since you just moved here... Once you've taken care of other things, stop by my store again to get the bill, hm? ... Ah, but I suppose you still need a place to rest your head, right?... Give me just a moment... 
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY That does it then! $ENTITY Yes, I'll have the moving company get right on moving your things, so wait just a moment... 
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Thanks for waiting! $ENTITY We've relocated it! Inside and out, it's just as it was before the move! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I must head back to my shop, $ENTITY so I'll say my good-byes for now. $ENTITY , you'll be heading back to the town hall $ENTITY after this, yes? $ENTITY Now that you've got a place to live, $ENTITY you have to take care of your resident registration with $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Well then, thank you for using $ENTITY Nook's Homes $ENTITY for all your housing needs!... I appreciate it, yes indeed!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Ta-ta-ta-DA!... I'll let you borrow this tent so you have somewhere to sleep! $ENTITY I've also put up a mailbox, so you can even start receiving mail!... It's a little shabby looking, though... $ENTITY I bet you rarely see a tent with a mailbox, right?... Oh ho ho ho ho! $ENTITY 
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I'll be returning to my shop, so let's part ways here. $ENTITY , you need to head back $ENTITY to the town hall $ENTITY , hm? $ENTITY Now that you know where you'll be living, $ENTITY you have to get registered as a resident, so talk to $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY . $ENTITY In the meantime, I'll work out the numbers. Come by my shop again later. $ENTITY Thanks for your business! $ENTITY I do appreciate it, yes, yes!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY I'm so glad you found a nice spot!
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY What's wrong? $ENTITY Don't you need to go back to the town hall right away?
NPC Prologue 3_4 $ENTITY If you ever want to talk about remodeling your home, $ENTITY just come see me in my shop, hm?
NPC Prologue 3_4 Once you wrap things up at the town hall, $ENTITY come see me in my shop. $ENTITY I'll be able to tell you how much your down payment will be when I next see you, yes I will!
