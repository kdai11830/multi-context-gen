HA ApD Moving I tried to wash my face this morning, $ENTITY and the water was frozen. $ENTITY It's waaay too cold here... . $ENTITY Maybe I should move to a warmer town. $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY That's the plan! $ENTITY I'm outta here on the $ENTITY of this month!... Don't go! See ya!
HA ApD Moving Ahh... it's the end of the year. $ENTITY I wonder if everyone will do their year-end cleaning and stuff? $ENTITY But more importantly, $ENTITY how can I get out of year-end cleaning... I got it! $ENTITY That's it! $ENTITY I can just move out! $ENTITY No need to clean if I'm not there, right? $ENTITY Hah hah! $ENTITY What a great idea! $ENTITY Well, I better get ready! $ENTITY I think I'll leave on the $ENTITY of this month!... Don't go! Good-bye!

HA ApD Moving Well, summer's over, $ENTITY and I think it's time for me to leave ... Yeah! $ENTITY I've made up my mind! $ENTITY I'm outta here on the $ENTITY of next month!... Please don't go! Good luck!
HA ApD Moving I went to wash my face this morning, $ENTITY and the water was frozen! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY too cold... . $ENTITY I need to move to a warmer town. $ENTITY Hey, that's what I'll do! $ENTITY I think I'll leave on... the $ENTITY of next month!... Stay here! Have a nice life!
HA ApD Moving Awww... Time for year-end cleaning again already?! $ENTITY How can I get out of this? $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY That's it! $ENTITY If I move out, I won't hafta clean, right? $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY What a great idea! $ENTITY Well, I better get plannin'. $ENTITY I think I'll leave on the $ENTITY of next month!... Don't go! Nice knowin' ya!

HA ApD Moving $ENTITY 
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY I need to get more serious about training. $ENTITY What I really need are some high-altitude workouts... Why does $ENTITY have to be so close to sea level? $ENTITY I hate to break it to you, $ENTITY but I'm outta here on the $ENTITY of this month!... Don't go! Who are you again?
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY I've done about as much damage as I can do in this town. $ENTITY I think it's time for a change of scenery. $ENTITY Yeah... The $ENTITY of this month seems like a perfect move-out day, don't you think, ... I expect I'll be celebrating my big win in the $ENTITY championship that day too!... Don't go! See ya later!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY I should probably get ready to make some big moves... $ENTITY Gotta leave my mark on the world, you know? $ENTITY I'm past due for my big-time debut, don't you think? $ENTITY But for that, I pretty much have to leave town. $ENTITY So I'm thinking the $ENTITY of this month is a good day to move out. And that is that. $ENTITY Don't go! Good luck!
HA ApD Moving Hey, ... Have I told you I'm thinking about moving? $ENTITY I want to go check out other towns and learn about some new training methods. $ENTITY It'll be like a training tour! $ENTITY So anyway... $ENTITY Gotta strike while the iron is hot! $ENTITY I think the iron will be hot on the $ENTITY of this month! $ENTITY Don't go. I'll miss you. Have a nice tour!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Hmm... $ENTITY I'm looking to change my image a tiny bit, $ENTITY but I think I need a big change of scenery to do it. $ENTITY Everyone always expects me to be Mr. Positive. $ENTITY But what if I just feel like being moody sometimes? $ENTITY As long as I'm in this town, $ENTITY I'll never be able to just sit with a cup of tea and have a good sigh. $ENTITY Alrighty! $ENTITY In a new town, a teensy bit of quiet emotion will make me so much more cool! $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY I'm gonna set the $ENTITY of this month as my move-out date! I've made up my mind!... Stay here! Enjoy the new you!
HA ApD Moving I want to refresh my mind a little.... So I'm thinking about moving out. $ENTITY Living in a new town will be perfect for helping me focus on more intense training, ... Let's see... The $ENTITY of this month would be nice!... All right! I'll move out on that day! $ENTITY Don't go! Good luck!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY I'm not getting the high-altitude training I need here in ... Why do we have to be so close to sea level? $ENTITY Can't you do something about that? $ENTITY Haha! $ENTITY I'm just kidding! $ENTITY I'm trying to lighten the mood. I'm movin' on the $ENTITY of next month!... Wait. What? Don't go! Go reach new heights!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Man, I think I've done everything there is to do in this town. $ENTITY The question is, should I move out? $ENTITY Yeah... definitely. $ENTITY I'm leaving on the $ENTITY of next month! $ENTITY I should be celebrating my big win in the $ENTITY tourney that day too, ... Don't go! Take care!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Well, it's past time for me to let the rest of the world know who I am. $ENTITY I need to break into the big time, and I'm thinking I should start by moving to another town. $ENTITY Yep, that's the way to go. $ENTITY I think I'll move out on the $ENTITY of next month! $ENTITY Don't go! Good luck!
HA ApD Moving So. $ENTITY Hey.... I'm thinking about moving out of this little town. $ENTITY I want to go on a training tour of some different places, maybe teach a little buffness theory abroad. $ENTITY Alrighty! $ENTITY I'm pumped up to do this! $ENTITY I'll leave on the $ENTITY of next month. $ENTITY But we'll miss you! Have fun!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Somebody told me I've toned every muscle in my body except my coolness muscle! $ENTITY Can you believe it? $ENTITY And no matter how hard I work out, I can't strengthen my image. $ENTITY So I guess they were right. $ENTITY The sad truth is, I need a new town. $ENTITY I need a place where no one knows me and I can practice looking cool. $ENTITY Alrighty! $ENTITY A move is just what I need! $ENTITY I'm looking at the $ENTITY of next month $ENTITY as my new coolness birthday!... Be cool here! Be cool elsewhere!
HA ApD Moving I gotta renew my focus. $ENTITY And I think moving away is my best chance for doing just that. $ENTITY Living in a new town will be good for my focus muscles! $ENTITY I'm not sure where the focus muscles are, but... Well, I'll figure it out later. $ENTITY In my new town, ... Let's see... $ENTITY The $ENTITY of next month would be nice.... Alrighty! $ENTITY It's settled. That's movin' day! $ENTITY Don't go! Good luck!
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY 
HA ApD Moving ... I see. $ENTITY Just can't let me go, huh? $ENTITY Honestly, my plan was to stay, $ENTITY but only if you asked me to. $ENTITY Heh heh! $ENTITY OK, I guess I can stay in this town and look out for you a little while longer, ... 
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Oh, come on! $ENTITY You're making it really hard for me to leave! $ENTITY OK, I give up! $ENTITY I can't move now.... I'll see you around, $ENTITY !
HA ApD Moving ... Ha ha! $ENTITY Well, if you're gonna miss me that much, $ENTITY I guess I won't go! $ENTITY Ha! $ENTITY You're crazy! $ENTITY !

HA ApD Moving $ENTITY 
HA ApD Moving Well, I guess I can leave this town with no regrets... Wait! $ENTITY I just realized we'd be closer if we had talked a bit more. $ENTITY Hmm... $ENTITY I just can't leave things like this,... I'm changing plans! $ENTITY I'm staying. And we're gonna work on our friendship! $ENTITY I can always move out and work on my own stuff later, ... 
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Did I detect a sigh of relief? $ENTITY Hey, wait a sec! $ENTITY You're not gonna go easy on the exercising after I'm gone, are you?! $ENTITY If that's the case, I can't move!... Yeah. No way I'm moving now. $ENTITY !
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Oh, man! $ENTITY I really thought you'd try to stop me, since we're such good friends and all. $ENTITY Or are you just thinking of what's best for me? $ENTITY Hmm... I just can't read you like I thought I could. $ENTITY Yeah, I can't move now. $ENTITY Obviously I need to stick around and help you help me read you better... Right?! $ENTITY Until then, this town is stuck with me, $ENTITY !
HA ApD Moving $ENTITY Thanks for everything, ... I'm excited about my life's journey. $ENTITY Just don't let me hear about you slacking off in your training, OK? $ENTITY
