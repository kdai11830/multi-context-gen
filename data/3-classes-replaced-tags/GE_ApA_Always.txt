GE ApA Always * $ENTITY 
GE ApA Always $ENTITY This might be really out there, but... $ENTITY if you dropped an axe in a magic pool, $ENTITY ... and a goddess appeared and she said she'd transform it for you, $ENTITY which one would you choose?... #x0; $ENTITY Golden axe! Glitter axe! What? Leave it alone!

GE ApA Always $ENTITY 
GE ApA Always Really? Wait... $ENTITY did I ask it right? I thought BOTH options were pretty great. $ENTITY Yeah, I totally asked it wrong. I'll try again sometime, ... When you least expect it!
GE ApA Always Uh, what? Wait... $ENTITY I think I messed up the whole multiple-choice thing. Yes, for sure! $ENTITY Next time I'll do better! If you're going with none of the above, I'm not giving you very good options!
GE ApA Always $ENTITY So I ate some $ENTITY earlier, and now I'm WAY too hyper! $ENTITY How can I slow down, ... Run until tired. Bonk on the head. Pitfall, pitfall!

GE ApA Always $ENTITY Waitwhat? You DO mean with one of those toy-hammer thingamajigs, right, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY How is THAT supposed to settle me down? Those things are a menace to society!
GE ApA Always $ENTITY What? You want me to jump into a pitfall to chill out? That's pretty extreme, $ENTITY . $ENTITY But now that I think about it... $ENTITY Pretty darn effective. $ENTITY You're a genius, $ENTITY !
