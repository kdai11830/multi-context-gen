GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Get a load of you, $ENTITY ! You're looking, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY almost kinda stylish today!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY You really think so? $ENTITY I'm... $ENTITY I'm very flattered.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY 
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY But you'd look even trendier $ENTITY if you added some snazzy accessories. $ENTITY Accessorization is, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY KEY.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Really? But I'm not much for flashy things. $ENTITY I don't even know HOW to accessorize!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY it's totally easy. $ENTITY Purses are the perfect accessory. $ENTITY You don't even have to carry stuff in 'em! $ENTITY That's what we stylish girls like to call $ENTITY "making a statement." You should try it sometime!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY But you'd look even BETTER if you'd only snazz up your image a little bit! $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY with an attitude!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY An attitude? $ENTITY You mean, $ENTITY like, $ENTITY a BAD attitude? $ENTITY I'm really not sure... $ENTITY 
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Not a BAD attitude, really. $ENTITY Just... an edgy one. $ENTITY Otherwise folks'll think you're all sugar and spice!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY But you could really use a new wardrobe. $ENTITY You've got to dress to impress, $ENTITY and I am NOT impressed!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Well, it's not really my goal to impress everyone I meet with my clothes.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY You have no idea what you're saying! $ENTITY I can totally tell that you're on the cusp of utter stylishness... $ENTITY But you have to trust me and update that wardrobe of yours! $ENTITY I'm saying this for your own good!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Now that I think about it... I really am happy just the way I am. $ENTITY I don't think I need to change at all!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Sheesh! $ENTITY Never mind then. But you should know that most folks would pay $ENTITY BIG money to hear my advice!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Hey there! $ENTITY I need to come up with names for my new album. $ENTITY Can you help me?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Sure! $ENTITY Let me hear what you've got.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Great, $ENTITY thanks! $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY the first name I came up with is $ENTITY Sings Songs and Stuff!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Isn't that a little... on the nose?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Well, duh. $ENTITY It's $ENTITY SUPPOSED to be. $ENTITY Never mind. It's probably too sophisticated for my audience. $ENTITY How about $ENTITY 's Super Sing-Along? $ENTITY Except I hate when my fans sing along with me! RUDE!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY That might be considered false advertising, $ENTITY then.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY 
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Maybe I should just go the diva route and call it simply... . ... That's epic! Who's $ENTITY ?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Maybe I should be, $ENTITY like, totally esoteric and call it $ENTITY Tonal Preludes in the Chord of $ENTITY . $ENTITY Do you like that one, ... I don't get it. That's brilliant!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY 
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY I think I already own an album by that name...
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY But... why would you name your album that?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Whatever. You obviously don't know what you're talking about.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Why did I even bother asking?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY We don't talk enough. $ENTITY Hey, let's have some girl chat, $ENTITY !
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Girl chat, you say? $ENTITY That sounds like fun. $ENTITY How do we $ENTITY "girl chat"?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Well, we can talk about clothes... or boys... or makeup... or boys... I dunno $ENTITY all sorts of things!
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY Well, I don't know very much about those $ENTITY other things...
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY FINE! $ENTITY Is there something you DO know a lot about? $ENTITY And don't make me regret asking!
GE 3P Fu &amp; $ENTITY 
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY As a matter of fact, there IS something I know a lot about. $ENTITY I just read a book about $ENTITY dinosaurs. $ENTITY Fascinating creatures, really. $ENTITY Did you know that some were tiny?... You could hold them in your hand! $ENTITY Imagine me with a $ENTITY pint-sized dino. $ENTITY I'd name her $ENTITY Chompy. $ENTITY So... does that count as girl chat?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY As a matter of fact, there IS something I know a lot about. $ENTITY I just read a book about $ENTITY gyroids. $ENTITY You know how gyroids really like to dance? $ENTITY It's because they all have the same song stuck in their heads. $ENTITY An entire race of items with the $ENTITY SAME song stuck in their heads! $ENTITY I wonder what it sounds like... So... does that count as girl chat?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY As a matter of fact, there IS something I know a lot about. $ENTITY I just read a book about $ENTITY aliens. $ENTITY It made me question whether or not extraterrestrials $ENTITY really exist. All signs point to... maybe. $ENTITY What if they're looking down at us $ENTITY from their faraway planets? $ENTITY We must look like ants to them! So... does that count as girl chat?
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY +
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY This is the weirdest girl chat I've ever had.
GE 3P Fu $ENTITY I can NOT talk to you!
