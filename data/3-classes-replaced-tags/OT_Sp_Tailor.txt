OT Sp Tailor $ENTITY Anyone can put on a suit or a fancy dress and look good. $ENTITY But it takes real fashion know-how to put together a casual outfit that's comfy and flattering.
OT Sp Tailor $ENTITY Why don't you try on something a little more daring. $ENTITY Say, $ENTITY an open-backed dress? Heh. $ENTITY The only problem is I'm not sure there are many places in $ENTITY to wear it... 
OT Sp Tailor $ENTITY Good to see you here,... It's fun to shop with someone else who appreciates fashion. ... let's go crazy and max out our Bells! $ENTITY Or ... not. $ENTITY Just an idea... 
OT Sp Tailor $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY having a wardrobe full of designer clothes doesn't make you automatically stylish. $ENTITY Think quality, $ENTITY not quantity. $ENTITY It's not about how many fancy foreign names are on the label. In fact... sometimes the people with the worst taste have the most clothes.... It's not fair, $ENTITY I know.
OT Sp Tailor $ENTITY That's good! $ENTITY Black is THE classic color. $ENTITY It's slimming, and it goes with everything. $ENTITY Black is the new black!
