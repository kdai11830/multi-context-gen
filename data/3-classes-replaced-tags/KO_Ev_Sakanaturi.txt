KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY I wish the $ENTITY Fishing Tourney $ENTITY would hurry up and start already. $ENTITY I'm anxious to catch a bunch of fish and blow away the competition!
KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Today's the big $ENTITY Fishing Tourney... I'm just going to warn you though $ENTITY don't get in my way, all right?!
KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Today is the $ENTITY Fishing Tourney... Well, $ENTITY even though we both know I'm gonna win, $ENTITY you shouldn't give up!

KO Ev Sakanaturi Are you after a trophy $ENTITY too?! $ENTITY I'll let you get the silver one! $ENTITY That gold one is mine!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY How goes the fishing?... You won't win if all you're catching are small fry, you know? $ENTITY Either way, I don't see how you can win against me!... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Is it better to patiently stay in the same spot, or should you try a bunch of different spots... ? $ENTITY I think everyone has their own way of doing things! $ENTITY I'll just say this: $ENTITY if you don't see a fish's shadow, $ENTITY then there ain't a fish to catch! $ENTITY GAHAHA!
KO Ev Sakanaturi $ENTITY Hmmm? $ENTITY You don't look like you're feeling the pressure at all! $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY don't tell me you already caught something big?! $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY I just remembered something I have to do! $ENTITY I don't have time to stand around shooting the breeze with you!... See ya!... !
KO Ev Sakanaturi When you cast your line into the water, $ENTITY are you paying attention $ENTITY to the way the water's flowing? Or $ENTITY are you watching the way the fish's shadow's facing? $ENTITY I suppose it's kind of rude to lecture you on the basics, huh?... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO Ev Sakanaturi The $ENTITY Fishing Tourney $ENTITY is gonna end pretty soon, ya know? $ENTITY Are you sure you have time to waste chatting with me?!
