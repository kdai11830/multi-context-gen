HA Sp Museum_Fossil This is such a nice space, but there aren't a lot of fossils here!... Oh, I know! I should probably stand here instead! $ENTITY Rawr! I'm a big $ENTITY fossil!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil Oh... I wanted to see more fossils, ... At this rate, I'll turn into a fossil before they get some new ones!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY The collection here is simply amazing! All the nooks and crannies are filled with fossils!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY This is like a dreamland where we can find all kinds of cool fossils! $ENTITY Ohhh! This is crazy! I wish I could live here!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY If I had encountered dinosaurs when they were alive... I bet we would have been good rivals!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY Eventually, I plan on getting as big as a dinosaur. $ENTITY So say hello to a future fossil!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY This is really awesome... Dinosaurs are so big and strong looking! I hope to be one someday!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY It must have been quite a chore to polish these fossils! $ENTITY Oh! And they probably had to be really careful not to break anything!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY I bet some of these turned into fossils $ENTITY while being out and about just like you are now!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil $ENTITY They say if you find a new type of fossil, you'll get to name that dinosaur! $ENTITY If I were to name one, it would be Super $ENTITY -a-Saurus! $ENTITY That's the perfect name for the strongest dinosaur, don't you think?
