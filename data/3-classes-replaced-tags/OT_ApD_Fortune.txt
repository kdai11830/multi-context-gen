OT ApD Fortune $ENTITY I'd like to tell you something. $ENTITY You know I'm a fairly picky $ENTITY , right? And I'm really picky when it comes to friends.

OT ApD Fortune ... Oh, what's come over me? ... I didn't want to say any of that. It just slipped out!

OT ApD Fortune $ENTITY Hold on.... Why did I just say that? $ENTITY Hmm. It must be one of those days, $ENTITY .
OT ApD Fortune ... Oh, what was all THAT about?!... Why did I say it? It just popped into my head, $ENTITY !

OT ApD Fortune How curious.... I like giving gifts, but I'm not sure what that was all about, $ENTITY .
