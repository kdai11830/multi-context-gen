ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I can't wait to serve my homemade dishes to everyone,... ! $ENTITY I hope I didn't forget anything...
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I guess I don't yet have ... My dish won't be complete if I don't have it,... If you can bring it to me, $ENTITY I can give you another ingredient in exchange,... !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Did you bring me $ENTITY ? Do you have one I could use? $ENTITY Yup, here you go! Nah, I don't have one.
ZK Ev Harvest Hmm. I don't seem to have a single $ENTITY . My food isn't the sam $ENTITY without it! $ENTITY Here you go! I don't have it.
ZK Ev Harvest If you could just give me ... I'd share an ingredient as well... .
ZK Ev Harvest Actually... I already collected various ingredients for today,... If you and I trade a few, $ENTITY we could cook completely different things!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey, why do you feel the need to tease people like that,... ?
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY This is... Well, I don't need it, so I'll pass on it for now,... What I need more than anything is $ENTITY !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yep, yep! $ENTITY That's it! $ENTITY This is exactly what I needed!... Well, $ENTITY I should give you an ingredient as well. All right, here you go! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY I gotta continue cooking!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Here's a smart piece of advice $ENTITY from $ENTITY . Listen up, $ENTITY !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you ever find yourself making $ENTITY , try adding $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY as a secret ingredient. It'll create a really refreshing taste! Pretty clever, huh,... ?
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY If it's $ENTITY you're making, try adding a chopped $ENTITY apple $ENTITY as a secret ingredient. $ENTITY It'll make things nice and crispy!

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Once I'm done cooking, $ENTITY maybe it'd be a good idea to go and check out the food table at the plaza... .
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I heard that girls like men who cook, $ENTITY but I wonder if it's really true... Oh, $ENTITY uh, don't worry about it! $ENTITY I was just talking to myself,... !
ZK Ev Harvest You're asking what I want to cook?... Well, if I had to pick something... Probably some fish cookies? $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Your mom never made you fish cookies when you came home from a long day at school?!

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY What do you think? $ENTITY Does this look good on me?... ?
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everyone seemed to really like my homemade cooking,... !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I realized... the reason why I cook is to see the smiles on people's faces!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Phew... I was standing the whole time I was cooking, and now I'm quite exhausted,... .
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks to you, $ENTITY I managed to finish cooking! $ENTITY I appreciate it,... !
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you hadn't shared that ingredient with me when you did... that dish would've been woefully incomplete! $ENTITY Thanks,... !

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I cooked something, $ENTITY but I wonder if anyone liked it...... ?
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is nice, since it brings the town together in a feeling of unity,... . $ENTITY But this year $ENTITY the top chef, $ENTITY Franklin... didn't show $ENTITY what he's capable of... I hope next year... he really gives it all he's got!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I cooked something, $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY but I couldn't make much. There weren't enough ingredients for a lot... Everyone seemed happy, though!... Seeing people smiling after they eat always encourages me to cook... 
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking this year $ENTITY was so delicious, $ENTITY but I felt like there wasn't enough food to go around. $ENTITY I kinda wish there was something like some kind of huge cake... And all the cake'd be for me!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I tried cooking some food for everybody,... But I didn't have enough ingredients and couldn't prepare something I could proudly serve... Even so, $ENTITY I liked my food quite a bit!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY All of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's dishes this year $ENTITY were really good, $ENTITY but there was no main dish... If there was something with tofu, $ENTITY perhaps it would've been nice, $ENTITY don't you think? $ENTITY Hah ha!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I cooked for everyone in town,... seemed to really like the main dish I made! Heh heh!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY All of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's dishes $ENTITY tasted really good, $ENTITY but I feel like something was missing... Oh, I know! $ENTITY There was no dessert!... Having a dessert after your meal makes you much more satisfied!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I served what I cooked to everyone in town,... Special Appetizer,... Special Soup,... Special Pasta... And to conclude, $ENTITY Special Dessert! $ENTITY Plenty of $ENTITY specials today. The more $ENTITY you add, $ENTITY the more delicious things get!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY the dinner we had this year was truly fabulous! $ENTITY That's exactly what you can expect $ENTITY from a combination of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's $ENTITY and your cooking, though!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY I cooked food for everyone in town,... People loved my food just as much as they loved the stuff $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY made,... . $ENTITY You probably didn't get to try any though since it was gone so fast!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Nobody $ENTITY except for a top chef like $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY would think about serving a huge meal in ... And his assistant chef at the time was you, right, ... I bet $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY is really happy with the work you've done!... Of course, $ENTITY we're all thankful as well!
ZK Ev Harvest Food with $ENTITY oysters $ENTITY in it has a unique kind of smell that some people don't like, right? $ENTITY Well, fear no more!... Squeeze a $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , and pour the fresh juice over your dish... . $ENTITY Your food will be refreshing and much easier to eat,... !

ZK Ev Harvest If you choose $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY as the main ingredient in your salad, $ENTITY sometimes it feels like that's not enough, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY At times like that, $ENTITY put in honey taken from a $ENTITY beehive...

ZK Ev Harvest A salad with lots of ingredients just mixed in haphazardly will usually have an indistinct taste, right? $ENTITY For cases like that, $ENTITY use a little $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY to give your salad some sass! $ENTITY It adds tanginess and brings a sense of harmony to the individual flavors!
ZK Ev Harvest When you put $ENTITY fish $ENTITY in a salad, $ENTITY people usually complain about the fishy smell, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY So $ENTITY don't forget to add in some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY to get rid of the smell, OK,... ? But $ENTITY your salad will still need a bit of a kick... And that's where the $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY comes in! $ENTITY That will give it a fresh, $ENTITY citrusy taste, $ENTITY making your salad even more delicious!

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY For soup with $ENTITY clams $ENTITY in it, $ENTITY I really recommend adding some $ENTITY butter... It makes your soup mild, yet rich. Clams and butter just go really well together!... ! $ENTITY They're like a couple... that's been together forever!
ZK Ev Harvest You can greatly change the taste of soup with $ENTITY fish $ENTITY in it by simply adding something to temper the flavor. $ENTITY Perhaps something like the sweet, $ENTITY citrusy flavor of some types of fruit would work...

The sweetness of the lobster... . $ENTITY You can just add in whatever else you have on hand to cause a flavor revolution! $ENTITY The sweet taste that flows all over your taste buds... You can't escape its charm! $ENTITY The scent of the tropics... . $ENTITY Oh yeah! $ENTITY If you added some $ENTITY coconut... I bet it'd kick it up a notch in flavor!
ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Sauted fish $ENTITY gets a bit oily since it's fried with butter... But if you squeeze a $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY over the fish... you can enjoy a refreshing taste with a lemony smell!
ZK Ev Harvest The center of a good $ENTITY pan-fried olive flounder $ENTITY is pretty juicy, as it's fried with flour on the outside part... . $ENTITY But if you pour a little bit of $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY on top of it... you'll be able to enjoy the dish with a fancy kick,... !
ZK Ev Harvest With $ENTITY fish $ENTITY dishes, $ENTITY getting rid of the fishy smell is vital,... Usually people use $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY to get the job done... Huh? $ENTITY So which one works better?... Well, I guess that depends on how you like it tasting!
ZK Ev Harvest The inside part of $ENTITY pan-fried dab $ENTITY is pretty juicy, $ENTITY as it's fried with flour on the outside. $ENTITY If you pour a bit of $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY over the top of the dish before serving... you'll get an extra kick to enjoy your fancy meal,... !

ZK Ev Harvest Baking pies that make the most of the sweetness of $ENTITY fruits $ENTITY is a good idea more times than not. $ENTITY But I do recommend using honey... taken from a $ENTITY beehive...

ZK Ev Harvest When you bake a pie with $ENTITY lots of fruits... the taste tends to be a bit indistinct, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY At times like this, $ENTITY #x2;lemon $ENTITY juice for a tart bit of flavor! $ENTITY It brings out the sweetness of the fruits and allows each distinct flavor to shine through!
ZK Ev Harvest When baking $ENTITY coconut tarts... you need to be careful about adjusting the sweetness. $ENTITY I recommend using honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY if you get the chance. $ENTITY The flavor and natural sweetness of honey will add a little kick and make it even more delicious!

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yes, I know. $ENTITY Today is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY I'd rather go and enjoy eating rather than cooking,... Heh heh. $ENTITY Let's see how deliciously everyone else can cook!

ZK Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking this year $ENTITY was really good, $ENTITY but I felt like something crucial was missing... That's right! $ENTITY There was no dessert!... Girls love it when there's dessert!
