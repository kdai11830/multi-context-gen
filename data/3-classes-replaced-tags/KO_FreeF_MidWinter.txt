KO FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY When we go from fall to winter, the days get colder and colder... And then the season really kicks in at the $ENTITY Winter Solstice... Things are just gonna keep getting more and more bitterly cold as we move toward the inevitable spring! $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Planet! $ENTITY Why don't you just make up your mind and keep things the same!... Sheesh.
KO FreeF MidWinter I feel like it starts to get really cold right after the $ENTITY Winter Solstice... We'll both have to be careful not to catch colds,... !
KO FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY "The shortest day of the year." $ENTITY Hearing that when I was a kid would always get me excited!... It made me think I could start staying up even past sunset! $ENTITY Nowadays... it just feels like a safety hazard that I don't wanna deal with! $ENTITY Ugh. It's hard becoming an adult.
KO FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY They say the sun rises later in the winter, but... I hardly notice it! $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY why should I care if I'm asleep during sunrise?... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF MidWinter $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY doesn't today seem especially chilly to you?... Is it 'cause the sun won't come up? $ENTITY I suppose it's not very mature to whine and complain all day... but flib-flabbert, I'm old and I'm cold!
