Do you know what day it is today? $ENTITY Yep, yep! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY April Fools' Day $ENTITY , the day of pranks and tricksters! $ENTITY Although $ENTITY the tricksters you have here in $ENTITY aren't very good! $ENTITY I'll show you the skills of a true professional trickster! $ENTITY What am I gonna do? $ENTITY I'll $ENTITY change myself to look just like someone $ENTITY in this town, $ENTITY and then I'll pay that person a surprise visit! $ENTITY Sounds like fun, don't you think?! ... Huh? $ENTITY Do you think I'm lying? $ENTITY Hee hee! $ENTITY If you don't believe me, just you wait for the fun to start! $ENTITY Let's see. $ENTITY Whose house should I begin with today... Oh, before I forget!... When the ticket gates are open or when someone's visiting, my fun stops, OK? $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY Let's cause some mischief!
NPC Mysterycat Are you having fun playing with all the tricksters on $ENTITY April Fools' Day... Today, $ENTITY I'll make myself look like various people in town $ENTITY and pay them all a $ENTITY surprise visit! $ENTITY Eh?! $ENTITY Think I was lying just now?... Hee hee! $ENTITY If that's what you think, come and watch the fun in a bit! $ENTITY Let's see $ENTITY whose house I should pick for my first trick of the day... Oh! $ENTITY And remember, $ENTITY when the ticket gates are open or you have a visitor, the surprise has to be postponed! $ENTITY Then $ENTITY let's get this going!
NPC Mysterycat ... Or $ENTITY I would,... but it's already too late to start now! $ENTITY Well, I guess you'll have to wait until next year to enjoy the fun!
NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY You've got a good eye for tricks! $ENTITY I thought I was the master of disguise... But it looks like you've got skills even greater than mine to see through my tricks and traps!... Well, don't get cocky! You might have had the upper hand this year, but that doesn't always last! $ENTITY Just be prepared for next year, $ENTITY 'cause I'll be coming back strong!
NPC Mysterycat I was gonna surprise you, but you ended up $ENTITY finding me every single time without fail... How did you manage to do that?! $ENTITY I worked so hard to fool everyone, and you saw right through me! $ENTITY Did you cheat? I bet you cheated! There's no other way around it!... I'm sorry. That was rude of me. $ENTITY I've just got to admit $ENTITY you're the real master of disguise!
NPC Mysterycat My disguise was pretty good, huh? $ENTITY People in town seemed to like my little surprise,... so I'm rather happy!
NPC Mysterycat I should polish my skills more $ENTITY so everyone will enjoy my fun prank again next year too!
NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY You've got a pretty good eye! $ENTITY And I was so confident in my disguise skills too... 
NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY That was pretty entertaining, right?... Though I'm a little bummed you saw through my disguises.
NPC Mysterycat Hey there!... Do you know what day today is? $ENTITY Yep, yep! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY April Fools' Day $ENTITY , the day of tricks and pranks! $ENTITY I have a big surprise prepared for everyone in town today... Once the ticket gates are closed and the town isn't hosting any guests, $ENTITY I can carry out my plan! $ENTITY My prank is pretty sneaky, but I don't want anyone to interrupt it! $ENTITY Remember, $ENTITY when ... is showing on the bottom left of the screen... $ENTITY it means $ENTITY wireless communication is still activated, so people might decide to butt in! $ENTITY I don't mind if best friends want to chat with you and such, just as long as they stay at home! $ENTITY If you need to shut that down, $ENTITY talk to $ENTITY Porter $ENTITY at the station to stop all that wireless communicating!
NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY Today $ENTITY tricks are everywhere and pranks are plentiful! $ENTITY Although, $ENTITY compared to me, $ENTITY all other tricksters and pranksters are just rank amateurs!
NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY Huh?... Are you thinking about playing a trick on ME, by any chance?! $ENTITY There's no way I would fall for any tricks by amateurs! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I have quite a big surprise for everyone! $ENTITY I'll show you once the ticket gates are closed and no one's visiting the town! $ENTITY Remember, $ENTITY when ... is showing on the bottom left of the screen... $ENTITY that means wireless communication hasn't been deactivated! $ENTITY I can't have visitors coming in and messing up my scheme, can I? $ENTITY If you really want to chat with best friends or something, that's fine, $ENTITY as long as they stay at home! $ENTITY If you need to, $ENTITY talk to $ENTITY Porter $ENTITY to put a stop to wireless communication!
NPC Mysterycat I'll take a rest until the ticket gates are closed and we don't have any visitors in town. $ENTITY You'll see my surprise continue when the gates are closed! $ENTITY One thing to note: $ENTITY when ... is showing on the bottom left of the screen... $ENTITY it means wireless communication hasn't yet been deactivated. $ENTITY In that case, $ENTITY just talk to $ENTITY Porter $ENTITY to end the communication! $ENTITY I really don't mind if you still want to chat with best friends, $ENTITY but I can't have anyone interrupting my prank! $ENTITY Chat wirelessly, but make them stay at home!

NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Someone's locked themselves up in their home and won't talk to anyone right now?... I have NO idea why they'd do something like that...
NPC Mysterycat Tricks abound today! $ENTITY I'll get back to my surprise once the gates are closed and all the visitors are out of town again! $ENTITY Just remember, $ENTITY when $ENTITY is showing on the bottom left of the screen... $ENTITY it means wireless communication isn't deactivated yet, and I can't have visitors distracting me! $ENTITY You can still chat with best friends though. I don't mind that. $ENTITY It's just the town visits that have to stop! $ENTITY If you need to, $ENTITY talk to $ENTITY Porter $ENTITY to end the communication!

NPC Mysterycat $ENTITY It's already gotten so late today... I guess I should take it easy with my jokes. I know you're excited and all, but $ENTITY I'm already preoccupied with ideas for next year. I'm sorry I couldn't play with you, but I hope you still had lots of fun on $ENTITY April Fools' Day $ENTITY ! $ENTITY 
NPC Mysterycat ... Zzzz... zzzz... Nngah!... I guess you can even tell when I'm pretending to be asleep? $ENTITY
