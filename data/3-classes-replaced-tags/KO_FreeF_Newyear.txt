KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You know what I'm gonna do this year? $ENTITY I'm finally gonna kick this nasty cheese habit. OK, maybe not COMPLETELY remove cheese from my diet,... but I should cut back a bit. $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY only 19 full wedges in a day. $ENTITY That's cutting a whole wedge a day!... Pff, $ENTITY yeah, $ENTITY like you're a saint.
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You know what I've always kind of wanted to try? $ENTITY Moon jumping.... Yeah, I know what you're gonna say. $ENTITY "But, $ENTITY , you're a cow. That's so clich."... Sure, fine, let's just all say that stuff's clich. $ENTITY But maybe I've never done it, OK?! $ENTITY It stinks, but hey,... that's a big jump, $ENTITY even with a New Year's boost!
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Hey, you ever just sort of get the urge to roar into people's faces when the new year rolls around? $ENTITY Yeah, me neither, $ENTITY which is strange because my mom was always on my case about roaring more. $ENTITY I may be tough, $ENTITY but I just don't have it in me to bellow anymore. $ENTITY I'm just too nice now... GAHAHA!
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You hear that?... That, my friend, is the sound of a new year upon us! $ENTITY You really can't hear it? $ENTITY It's probably because your ears are so small.... Hah, funny-lookin' small-ears. Prolly can't hear nothin' with those small ears... $ENTITY Wha'zat? You can hear me? No way!... I didn't mean it! I take it back! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY All right, so it's a new year, and that means $ENTITY it's time for me to finally change these old shoes of mine. $ENTITY I'm supposed to get 'em changed more often,... but then again I'm also "supposed to" bathe daily. $ENTITY Pff, who's got time for that?... I've got stuff to do!
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY New Year's makes me think about family.... I wonder what they're up to right about now... . $ENTITY You ever hear about how every family has a "black sheep"? $ENTITY Well the first one was my cousin! $ENTITY Ol' Alibaster McSheep, my cousin thrice removed on my aunt's side. $ENTITY I don't actually know what that means, but who cares?... He's the black sheep anyway.
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY If I had to guess, $ENTITY I'd say you were never one for swinging from tree to tree on a humid jungle night. $ENTITY The new year always makes me pine for the days when I'd swing around, $ENTITY makin' faces at people. Wait, $ENTITY WHAT?! $ENTITY Makin' faces isn't considered polite?!... Why?!... Great, there goes my New Year's plans.
KO FreeF Newyear Most New Year's, $ENTITY I get the urge to $ENTITY finally get off my duff and rally up all the birds for a revolution. $ENTITY You know, we feathered champions just haven't had a good revolution lately. Not since $ENTITY the Great Avian Revolt of nineteen-aught-six at least.... Man, $ENTITY that was one for the history books.
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY I've got a good feeling about this new year.... Something about it makes me want to $ENTITY howl at the moon!
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY All right, $ENTITY as this year's unofficial deputy mayor,... I have authority over everyone in town.... GAHAHA! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY All right, this year is a contest between me and that tree in the event plaza!... Who can grow more?! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY If you're tired of eating normal New Year's food, why not switch it up $ENTITY with some ... Worth a try!... !
KO FreeF Newyear First dream of the new year... I wanted to write down what I was dreaming so I wouldn't forget it. But I couldn't find a pen! $ENTITY 
KO FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Ah, nothing quite like a good New Year's resolution to get you going! $ENTITY You think of anything fun this year? $ENTITY I'm going with an old standby: this year, $ENTITY I'm gonna read an entire book, start to finish! $ENTITY Yup, last year I nearly got through the whole first chapter, $ENTITY so I have high hopes for this year!
