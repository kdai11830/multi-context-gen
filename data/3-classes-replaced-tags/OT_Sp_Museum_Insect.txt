OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY It's too bad that a town like $ENTITY doesn't have a better museum. $ENTITY I think this place just needs a little more support from the community.
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY There are so many interesting bugs in the world... You just won't find many of them in this museum!
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY The bug collection at this museum is getting better all the time. $ENTITY It's so exciting when a new specimen arrives. $ENTITY It makes me want to come and visit every day!
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY , $ENTITY it's so amazing to see how many different bugs there are in $ENTITY . Listen! $ENTITY Aren't the sounds they make fascinating? $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY that one was just my stomach grumbling.
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY I heard this place has at least one of every type of insect that lives in $ENTITY . $ENTITY That's amazing! $ENTITY Someone around here must have some extreme bug-catching skills.
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you picked one of the least impressive spots to visit in $ENTITY . $ENTITY This part of the museum could use a little work... 
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Our museum has really been trying to improve its collection lately. $ENTITY Seeing a new specimen arrive is exciting, $ENTITY but it also reminds me how many we have yet to collect.
OT Sp Museum_Insect $ENTITY Do you have anything like this exhibit in your town? $ENTITY Our collection is pretty good, $ENTITY but I know there are still lots of interesting species out there.
OT Sp Museum_Insect ... these little guys sure do make a lot of noise. $ENTITY I'd love to borrow about 50 of them for a completely innocent, $ENTITY non- prank-related reason.
OT Sp Museum_Insect I don't mean to brag, $ENTITY but this is one of the best museums in the world. $ENTITY In fact, $ENTITY I happen to know that this particular wing houses $ENTITY all of the known insects in $ENTITY !
