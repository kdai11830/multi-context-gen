AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY 's house is in a really nice spot!... How'd $ENTITY #x0; find it? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0;l $ENTITY #x0;ll $ENTITY probably say it was "intuition" or something like that... but I wanna ask ... #x0; $ENTITY about it! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY Yeah, so... honestly... how is tent living treating you? $ENTITY I've done it before, but I feel like I need a bit more space. $ENTITY But at least you're enjoying the outdoors! $ENTITY Hang in there, $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY Heh heh! Your place is starting to shape up, huh? $ENTITY So what are your plans? $ENTITY Are you gonna keep building and building? $ENTITY #x0; Of course! I'm fine for now.

AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY The girl who works in the recycle shop always smells real nice and is super sweet! $ENTITY I run into some grumpy people... so it's great to be treated nice! $ENTITY Oh, I don't mean you! You're not usually that grumpy!... !
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY The dude who works in the recycle shop is a real wild cat! $ENTITY Something tells me he used to be a hooligan. $ENTITY He probably turned his life around to settle down with his cute wife! $ENTITY A hardworking former bad boy! $ENTITY That's what I like to think anyway.... It's just nice that he's so cool. $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY What are you doing by the station?... Taking pictures? $ENTITY I like taking pictures here because... you can get the shopping district in the background! $ENTITY I've seen train fans on TV who were really into that! $ENTITY !

AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY Hey... do you use all the space in that house of yours? $ENTITY Just askin'... It'd be pretty amazing if you did. I have a hard time using all the space in a single room! $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Hey, don't go thinking I'm jealous or anything! $ENTITY !
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY Hmmm... Maybe I should remodel my house to be as big as yours. $ENTITY But there are other things I need to spend my money on... Yeah, forget it!... I gotta save!
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY Whew! Your house sure is big!...

So there really isn't any reason to run away... .
AN FreeB Spot So... do you use that room on the second floor? $ENTITY If so, that's amazing! $ENTITY I have a hard enough time using all the space in a single room. $ENTITY But I still want to live in a place like yours someday... 
AN FreeB Spot $ENTITY I wonder how many more Bells I'd need to make a two-story house like yours... No! $ENTITY I don't have time to dream!... Now is the time to save, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
