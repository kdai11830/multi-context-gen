OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Happy birthday,... Your present is in the mail. $ENTITY I guess that kind of narrows down the type of gift it is, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Like, $ENTITY I couldn't mail you a pet elephant. $ENTITY Or could I? $ENTITY I guess you'll have to go home and check your mailbox to find out.
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Do you know what today is, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well, I should certainly hope so... It's your birthday! $ENTITY I sent you a little something in the mail... so be sure to take a look, $ENTITY OK?
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Have you checked your mail yet today,... Oh, $ENTITY goody! $ENTITY I sent a little surprise for you. $ENTITY Because it's your birthday! $ENTITY It IS your birthday, $ENTITY right?
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Hey,... ! $ENTITY Isn't today your birthday? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY happy birthday! $ENTITY I don't have anything for you right this moment... but I still have time, right?
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Today's your birthday, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY I knew it! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY this is a very special day for me... uh... I mean, $ENTITY YOU. $ENTITY 
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Guess whose birthday it is today,... Trick question. $ENTITY It's YOURS! $ENTITY Have a happy one, $ENTITY OK?
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY You're one of the lucky ones born on February 29th, $ENTITY right?... Oh,... , $ENTITY I'm so jealous! $ENTITY You can celebrate every year if you want, $ENTITY or you can play it cool and only celebrate every four years. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY no matter what you want to do this year, $ENTITY you should check your mailbox. $ENTITY I sent you a little gift. $ENTITY It's nothing much, $ENTITY but I hope you like it. $ENTITY Have a great day!
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY So $ENTITY your birthday is February 29th, right?... But there is no February 29th this year. $ENTITY So you get to celebrate a little bit early by default. $ENTITY ! Happy birthday!
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY As if February 29th weren't special enough already... it's your birthday! $ENTITY I'm sure you're tired of people joking about how you're technically younger than your actual age. $ENTITY But it's no joke to me! $ENTITY I want to trade birthdays. $ENTITY I guess the best I can do is help you celebrate your birthday in style.... So $ENTITY I sent you a little something... 
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY February 29th! $ENTITY We only get one of these every four years. $ENTITY But you know all about that, $ENTITY don't you? After all, $ENTITY it's your birthday! $ENTITY Your REAL birthday, $ENTITY when you have to actually age a little bit. You're probably tired of people joking about that,... but it's no joke to me. $ENTITY I want your birthday! Anyway, $ENTITY have a good one. $ENTITY I'll see you around.... !
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY I feel like I'm forgetting something. $ENTITY Today is significant for some odd reason... Ha! $ENTITY You think I would actually forget your birthday? $ENTITY Have a happy one,... !

OT Re Birthday $ENTITY So $ENTITY tomorrow would be your birthday, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY But there is no tomorrow this year... You probably get used to this sort of thing when your birthday is February 29th, $ENTITY right? $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY if you're celebrating today,... I hope you have 4 years' worth of fun. $ENTITY !
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You're in $ENTITY to celebrate your birthday?... I'm so glad I got to see you! $ENTITY Have fun, and don't do anything I wouldn't do. $ENTITY Don't worry. $ENTITY That means you can still bathe in caramel and eat $ENTITY for dinner.
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY Guess what?... I got you a present! $ENTITY 
OT Re Birthday $ENTITY I hope you like it...
