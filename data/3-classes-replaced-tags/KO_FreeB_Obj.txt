KO FreeB Obj $ENTITY The $ENTITY makes me feel like the times are changing really fast! $ENTITY I suppose $ENTITY is an early adopter of new technology... Well, nothing wrong with that! $ENTITY 
KO FreeB Obj $ENTITY I usually don't wear a watch, so I'm real grateful for clocks outside! $ENTITY Having the $ENTITY lets us know what the time is, no matter what!... !

KO FreeB Obj $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY the $ENTITY is in a really great spot! $ENTITY Without it... I'd lose some of my motivation when hunting bugs! $ENTITY #

KO FreeB Obj $ENTITY Thanks to the streetlights around here, it's nice and bright, even at nighttime... It's even in the best spot for catching bugs too! $ENTITY Though, if you run around in the dark, you might not spot a pitfall until it's too late.... Always a risk...
