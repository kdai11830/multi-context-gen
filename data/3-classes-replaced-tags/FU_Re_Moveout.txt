FU Re Moveout $ENTITY I'm finally ready to move to a new town. $ENTITY I thought it over for a long time and did lots of research. $ENTITY And I think it's time to move on.... I hope you'll celebrate this turning point in my life with me!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Did you come to help me move?... Oh! $ENTITY You've been worrying about me since we talked last. $ENTITY It's all right. $ENTITY As you can see, I'm doing just fine!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY I was just thinking that I needed to come say good-bye to you! $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY it was really kind of you to give me advice about moving. $ENTITY We won't be living in the same town anymore, but I hope you never forget me!
FU Re Moveout I'm so sorry! I've been running all over the place lately... Still, $ENTITY I should have told you sooner. $ENTITY It just never seemed like the right moment. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY I want to thank you for being my friend. I may be moving to a new town, $ENTITY but I promise never to forget you, $ENTITY !
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh? $ENTITY I don't think we've met, have we?... I live here in town, $ENTITY but the truth is $ENTITY I'm actually moving soon. I may be leaving town, $ENTITY but $ENTITY I'm sure you'll love it here!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh, ... Did you come over to play? $ENTITY Unfortunately, $ENTITY I'm getting ready to move.... But I'm glad we got to chat once more before I left. Even though I won't be here to see your smile, $ENTITY I hope you keep coming back to $ENTITY to play!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh my! $ENTITY And who might you be?... I live in this town now, $ENTITY but $ENTITY the truth is I'll be moving soon. $ENTITY I won't be here anymore, but you should visit again. $ENTITY It's a great place!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh, ... I've been wanting to see you! $ENTITY Unfortunately, $ENTITY I won't be able to play with you here in $ENTITY anymore. $ENTITY I'm moving soon. The thing is, $ENTITY I don't exactly know where I'm moving to yet. $ENTITY Live in my town! That sounds rough...
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh no! $ENTITY I'll be just fine. $ENTITY I'm surprised by how freeing it is, $ENTITY not having any plans and letting the winds take me where they may. $ENTITY So, please don't worry about me! $ENTITY I hope we meet again someday.
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Are you sure about that?... Living in the same town as you sounds like too much fun! Now that that's settled, $ENTITY I'll have to change the shipping labels on all my boxes to say $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So, I'll be busy for a while, $ENTITY but once I get settled into my new home, $ENTITY we should play together!
FU Re Moveout ... What?! $ENTITY Do you mean it?... It'd be great to be neighbors again! $ENTITY Then, I'll keep getting ready to move! $ENTITY Let's talk again later.
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Have we met before?... I'm ... I'm sure we'd be good friends if we got to know one another, $ENTITY but $ENTITY as you can see, $ENTITY I'm getting ready to move. Truth is, $ENTITY I haven't nailed down where I want to go yet... What about my town? Good luck!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Thanks! $ENTITY I think leaving my comfort zone like this will encourage me to try new things. I'm looking forward to it!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Do you mean it? $ENTITY This is the first time we've met, $ENTITY but you've been so kind to me. $ENTITY I'm really touched! $ENTITY It must be fate... Well, $ENTITY I accept your invitation to move in. $ENTITY I'll see you in $ENTITY in a day or two!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY I've finally got all my stuff boxed up.... I have way too many books... 
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY If I don't label each box with its contents,... I won't know where to find anything later!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Now, $ENTITY which box did I put $ENTITY in? $ENTITY I want to reread it as soon as I move, $ENTITY so it's got to be where I can find it right away!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY I hope that somewhere, $ENTITY someday, $ENTITY we'll meet again,... .
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY By the way, $ENTITY I decided to make $ENTITY my new home! $ENTITY If you ever feel like seeing me, $ENTITY please come over for a spell!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY I'm going to be $ENTITY of $ENTITY soon. $ENTITY Please come visit me if you get the chance.
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY We'll meet again soon in ... I have a lot to learn about living there, $ENTITY so I hope you're willing to show me the ropes!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Just think, $ENTITY soon we'll be neighbors again!... I'm pleased as punch about that, ... Let's be the kind of neighbors who drop in on each other unannounced and borrow each other's things.
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY The fruit here in town is so good for making tarts. $ENTITY But I need a change of pace $ENTITY and the chance to explore a new locale. $ENTITY I sure hope there's a good town out there that I can call home... What about my town? I hear ya...
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I rather like the idea of traveling from town to town in search of something grand. $ENTITY I'm just going to stay positive! $ENTITY Please wish me luck!
FU Re Moveout $ENTITY Do you really mean that?! $ENTITY If you feel that way, $ENTITY I just know I can't go wrong by moving there! I don't even need to visit to make up my mind.... Being neighbors with you will be great!
FU Re Moveout That's a great idea!... As long as it won't be any trouble for you, $ENTITY I'd love to move there! $ENTITY This means we can get together and eat $ENTITY just like we used to!
