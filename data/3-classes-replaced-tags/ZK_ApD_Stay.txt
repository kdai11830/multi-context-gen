ZK ApD Stay $ENTITY 
ZK ApD Stay So I was thinking of moving away from town. Folks here just didn't seem to get me. $ENTITY Then $ENTITY said I should stick around, so I'm giving $ENTITY another chance! $ENTITY Maybe I'm the one who needs to make more of an effort to be friends. $ENTITY I'm a bit of an odd duck, you know.... Uh, $ENTITY but no offense to ducks of course, $ENTITY !
ZK ApD Stay $ENTITY So did I tell you that I was thinking of moving out of town? $ENTITY I felt like I didn't fit in here, $ENTITY . $ENTITY But the thing is, $ENTITY told me I should stick with it a little longer. So I am! Hey, and I just wanted to say $ENTITY let's try to be better friends, ... I know I'm a little, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY quirky. $ENTITY But I'm turning over a new leaf, and I wanted to be sure to tell you!
ZK ApD Stay So I told you I was thinking of moving out of town, didn't I? Sorry if I didn't. I know I'm not always the most perky neighbor around here.

I just wanted to tell you, so I hope we can be good friends, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'll try my best, at least!
