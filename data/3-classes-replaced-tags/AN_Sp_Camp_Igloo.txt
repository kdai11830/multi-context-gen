AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I've camped in lots of different places, but $ENTITY sure seems like a great place to live! $ENTITY Maybe it's 'cause the snowy scenery here reminds me of my hometown... You're here visiting from some place else too, right? $ENTITY Let's enjoy ourselves here, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Living in an igloo in the winter really makes you feel like you're having an adventure! $ENTITY You doing a day trip?... 'Cause even after a long adventure, the train can still get you home! $ENTITY 
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I came here 'cause I heard everyone should see $ENTITY in the snow! $ENTITY That was a good tip,... !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY When I stand in the snow, I get to thinking about things like what it really means to be strong... Haha! Dude, listen to me getting all deep in front of a stranger! $ENTITY 
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Since I've been camping here, some $ENTITY folks have been stopping by to check on me. $ENTITY They're probably wondering who's this weirdo camping outside in the snow, right? $ENTITY I bet you were surprised to see me here too, huh? ... 
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Are you from this town? $ENTITY Ah, so you're ... Nice to meet ya! I'm ... I heard this town had good camping, so here I am! $ENTITY And it's just as nice as I had heard! $ENTITY Got my bed ready... Time to enjoy my winter camping, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Oh, hey! $ENTITY Are you from this town?... I'm just here visiting. $ENTITY Might as well tell you my name! I'm ... And you're... ? Nice! $ENTITY I basically just thought winter in $ENTITY sounded cool... I took a chance, and it worked out! $ENTITY I'm really glad I decided to come here! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Hey! You're from $ENTITY , right?... Nice to meet you! $ENTITY I'm ... I've been visiting a bunch of towns! $ENTITY You're, uh... , right? $ENTITY Glad I ran into ya! $ENTITY Piling up the snow like this was a little tough, but... I think I did a pretty good job! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Now that I'll be living here, I gotta build a house somehow! $ENTITY That's my main goal right now, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I've been pretty excited since I decided to move. But I'm about to get super busy, ... 
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Now that I'm committed to living here, I should start introducing myself to my new $ENTITY peeps.
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY talked me into it... so I'm totally moving to this town! $ENTITY It'll be a little while before I'm all settled in. But look out, 'cause here I come, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Oh, right! Did you hear? $ENTITY I'm moving to this town! $ENTITY just up and invited me all of a sudden! $ENTITY So I'll be seeing you around!
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY This person named $ENTITY said I should move here... so here I am! $ENTITY Camping here really helped me get a taste for the place! You'll see me settling in soon, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo ... Who came up with that name? 'Cause I like it! It's bold and in your face! ... 
AN Sp Camp_Igloo When you're sleeping in the snow, the cold is usually what wakes you up in the morning. $ENTITY But if you can power through it and keep right on sleeping, you get nice and toasty! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Camping is $ENTITY time. $ENTITY At least that's what I heard once. $ENTITY I've got a lot of different stuff to eat, but $ENTITY now I'm really craving $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY When you're camping, ya sure do hear a lotta different sounds! $ENTITY Snow falling... Ice melting... Even I can't help feeling in tune with nature, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY I've slept outside before in the summer... but I feel like sleeping outside in winter could get rough! $ENTITY It was tough to build, but I'm sure glad I have this igloo, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Since I've been camping here, I've felt really great. Maybe this town just suits me. $ENTITY Maybe... I should just move here? $ENTITY Yeah, move here! Think it over!
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY This town has a lot of great folks in it! I bet it would be fun to live here! $ENTITY Should I just go ahead and move in? $ENTITY Yeah, move here! Think it over!
AN Sp Camp_Igloo ... Just saying the name gives me a thrill. $ENTITY Maybe I'll become a resident? $ENTITY Yeah, live here! Don't be too hasty!
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Naw, man! $ENTITY I'm not ready for that kind of commitment! $ENTITY Anyway, I'm here as a tourist. So I only see what the town is like on the surface! $ENTITY I'd need to dig a little deeper and figure out the gritty inner workings of things first, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Whoa!... Hmmm... Probably a good idea before I commit. $ENTITY I guess you only see the sunny side of $ENTITY when you're just a camper, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Camp_Igloo $ENTITY Yeah, I was only joking! For me to move here, I'd have to figure out the internal power structure first!... And I'd have to decide if I could find myself here or whatever... That's what's important, $ENTITY !
