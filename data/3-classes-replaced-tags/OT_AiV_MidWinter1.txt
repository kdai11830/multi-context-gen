OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Welcome to $ENTITY . I hope you weren't planning on seeing anything, $ENTITY . It'll be dark ALL day. $ENTITY The sun's too lazy to get up today. $ENTITY It does this EVERY year on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good morning. $ENTITY Yes, $ENTITY I said morning. You'd never know, would you? Because it's still pitch black out! $ENTITY Why the sun doesn't bother to rise this day every year is beyond me.... Well, don't walk into anything, OK?
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Well done, coming all this way to $ENTITY so early in the morning, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I'm sorry to say the sun isn't going to light up our lovely town for you. Why? $ENTITY It's just like that today.
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Visiting $ENTITY today? How nice for us! I wish someone would have told the sun you're coming. $ENTITY Then maybe it would have shown up today! I can't WAIT to give it a piece of my mind tomorrow.
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good day,... That is, $ENTITY if you can call THIS "good" or "day." $ENTITY The $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY always keeps the sky dark from dawn to dusk. $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY try to have a good day, $ENTITY OK?
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Hi there,... . Welcome to our lovely town where the sun didn't bother to rise today. $ENTITY Sorry. Can you tell the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY bugs me? If I had to get up today, $ENTITY why didn't the sun?
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Good evening, $ENTITY . Glad you made it to $ENTITY in time for the longest $ENTITY night $ENTITY ever. We didn't really have morning, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY this morning. But it's always this way on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY .
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Oh, how lovely to see you here in $ENTITY . $ENTITY At least there's been ONE bright light in my whole day! We didn't get a single ray of sunshine today. $ENTITY Except for you, $ENTITY . So, $ENTITY well, $ENTITY thanks.
OT AiV MidWinter1 Welcome to ... Where the sun never rises, $ENTITY so the nights are twice as long! $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY I'm sorry. $ENTITY I just get like this on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY . Everything will be back to normal tomorrow.
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY What brings you way out here to $ENTITY so late at night,... ? $ENTITY Did you realize it's been night FOREVER today? What a relief the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is almost over!
OT AiV MidWinter1 $ENTITY Oh? How strange to run into you so very late, $ENTITY ! Then again, it's been a strange day here. The sun never came up, $ENTITY and so it never set either. $ENTITY It's thrown my internal clock ALL out of whack.
