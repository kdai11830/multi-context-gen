OT Ev Setsubun ... , an ogre?
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I knew this day would come... One of you ogres was bound to track me down eventually... 
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY So $ENTITY you think you can surprise me by... dressing up like an ogre? $ENTITY Wrong! $ENTITY I've been waiting for you!
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Ogre, $ENTITY ogre, $ENTITY go away. $ENTITY Come again another day. $ENTITY Or, $ENTITY don't.
OT Ev Setsubun Oh, $ENTITY did that hurt? $ENTITY Sometimes I don't know my own strength.... Plus, $ENTITY you seem like a strong ogre.
OT Ev Setsubun So $ENTITY do you think this year's $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY will keep $ENTITY safe from bad fortune until next year? For your sake, $ENTITY I sure hope it does.... Otherwise you'll be the one getting pelted with more beans!
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Throwing beans like that is oddly satisfying. $ENTITY Stand still. $ENTITY Let me throw some more! $ENTITY 
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY What's this? $ENTITY An ogre... with beans?... , that goes against everything I know about $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY Why don't you pick a side, $ENTITY and we'll pretend this never happened.
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Oh no, $ENTITY an ogre! $ENTITY You'll never take me without a fight. $ENTITY Waitare those beans in your hand? $ENTITY That's not fair! $ENTITY Everybody knows ogres don't throw beans.... !
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY What do we have here... another ogre? $ENTITY What's up with that? $ENTITY Didn't anyone teach you the rules?
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY I wish it were socially acceptable to throw beans at people in $ENTITY every day... 
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY C'mon, $ENTITY ogres! $ENTITY I've got a pocket full of beans and no one to throw them at. $ENTITY Believe me, $ENTITY I'll be throwing all these beans, $ENTITY even if it takes a couple weeks.
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY The longer I have to wait to throw my beans, $ENTITY the harder I am going to throw them.
OT Ev Setsubun Hey there, $ENTITY . $ENTITY What exactly are you planning to do with those beans? Oh, right $ENTITY throw them at an ogre, $ENTITY of course. $ENTITY I just wanted to make sure you knew the rules for $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY .
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Say... are those beans you have there? $ENTITY You weren't planning on throwing them at me, $ENTITY were you? $ENTITY Because two can play at that game. $ENTITY The bean-throwing game. $ENTITY On guard!
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Beans, $ENTITY beans, $ENTITY the magical fruit. $ENTITY Throw 'em at ogres and steal their loot. Er, $ENTITY wait.... Is that how the song goes?
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY , we're both loaded up with beans. $ENTITY Now if we could only find an ogre or two... 
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Throwing beans seems innocent enough... but what's next? $ENTITY Before you know it we'll be throwing tomatoes. ... And maybe one day, $ENTITY avocados. $ENTITY I for one don't want to live in a $ENTITY where people throw avocados at one another.
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY Got a bunch of beans and nowhere to throw them, $ENTITY eh, ... Me too. $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY is more exciting when the ogres show up. $ENTITY Trust me.
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY You're lucky I don't feel like cleaning up a bunch of splattered beans right now... 
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY We couldn't have $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY without our tireless ogre volunteers. $ENTITY So... thank you, $ENTITY ogres of $ENTITY !
OT Ev Setsubun $ENTITY , $ENTITY that's actually a pretty scary look on you. $ENTITY If this weren't $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY , $ENTITY I'd be terrified!
