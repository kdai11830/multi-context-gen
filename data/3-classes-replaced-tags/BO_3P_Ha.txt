BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Howdy,... Have you noticed that $ENTITY always seems to be shouting? $ENTITY Like, even when he's just talking?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY I don't think I'm that loud... Maybe you just have extra-sensitive ears or something.... What do you think, ... Am I really that loud? $ENTITY You're super loud. You're normal. You're super quiet.
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY See!... I told you, ... You're so loud, you sound like you're talking into a megaphone! $ENTITY It'd be great if you could turn it down a notch,... .
BO 3P Ha Well, $ENTITY if even $ENTITY thinks I'm super loud, $ENTITY I guess I should pipe down a little... Ahem!... How about this? $ENTITY Better? $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY What did you just say?! $ENTITY I can't hear you!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY I said, "IS THIS BETTER?!" $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY You really think his speaking voice is normal? $ENTITY He sounds like a sonic boom to me! He's so loud that hearing him talk for too long makes my head hurt. $ENTITY Oh, I know! $ENTITY How about from now on, $ENTITY we don't speak and just communicate telepathically instead? $ENTITY Sound good? $ENTITY OK, let's telepathize! $ENTITY Mooooom $ENTITY moom $ENTITY mooooooom... .
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Ooo $ENTITY oooo $ENTITY oooo $ENTITY !
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Cool! $ENTITY Did you understand what I just said to you?!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Uh... "Moom moom moom"?... What the heck does that even mean?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You really think he's that quiet, $ENTITY ?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Well, in that case, $ENTITY I'd better start training my vocal cords. $ENTITY Ahem!... UGH!... AUGH!... RAWR! $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Augh! $ENTITY You're blasting out my eardrums,... 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Hey!... Hey, $ENTITY did you hear? $ENTITY There's a rumor going around that $ENTITY is really strong!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY That's no rumor! $ENTITY That's just the plain truth! $ENTITY I'm so strong, $ENTITY I could move a mountain without even breaking a sweat!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Really?! $ENTITY That's awesome! $ENTITY And actually pretty convenient for me. $ENTITY See, I wanna move my house! $ENTITY But just a little bit. Think you can help me with that, $ENTITY ?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY You want me to move a house?! $ENTITY Are you serious?!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY It just needs to go about a foot south. $ENTITY If you could do it sometime this week, that'd be great,... 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Whoa! $ENTITY You're serious... Well, I can probably help you with that. $ENTITY As long as $ENTITY here helps ME out,... 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Hey,... , why are you always training so hard?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Why do I train so much?... Well, uh, it's obvious. $ENTITY I train 'cause... Um... Uh... Hey, $ENTITY ! Help me out here! Why do I train so hard? $ENTITY To build your body. To build your mind. 'Cause you want to.
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY That's it! $ENTITY To strengthen my body! $ENTITY Understand, $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY That's such a weirdly obvious answer... .
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah, $ENTITY I guess you're right... Hey!... Give me a less obvious thing to say! $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY Training fortifies your mind just as much as it does your body! $ENTITY You gotta exercise your willpower muscle and buff it up!
BO 3P Ha I don't think I have a willpower muscle. $ENTITY And even if I do, I bet it's pretty flabby.
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Not me! $ENTITY My willpower's so strong, it's made of steel! $ENTITY You can't tell right now, but I'm totally flexing! $ENTITY Thanks for helping me out!... You're a lifesaver! $ENTITY 
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Because I want to!... Yeah, that's it! $ENTITY I just like training! $ENTITY You like eating, right? $ENTITY Do you have a good reason why?
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY I like to eat, so I eat! $ENTITY That's the only reason!
BO 3P Ha $ENTITY Right! $ENTITY Just do the things you like, and don't let anyone question your reasons,...
