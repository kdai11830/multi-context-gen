FU Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY What is it?! $ENTITY Why did I need to come right this instant?!
FU Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY What do ya want so bad that I was forced to rush over here?
FU Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Well, I'm here. $ENTITY Now what do ya want with me?

FU Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Forgive me if I'm mistaken, $ENTITY but did you lose something near my house? $ENTITY This looks like it might be yours, ... Although I don't know why I keep finding your things in the middle of my flower bed... 
FU Q04 3P_Ko $ENTITY Oh! ... In your flower bed. $ENTITY Huh, yeah. $ENTITY I don't remember being in your flowers or anything, $ENTITY but that must be mine, $ENTITY so I'll just take it.
