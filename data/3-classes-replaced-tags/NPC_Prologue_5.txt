NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY Welcome back!
NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY Ah!... , your birthday's on February 29th, right?! $ENTITY This year isn't a leap year... Well, it's a day early, but happy birthday anyway! Becoming mayor, $ENTITY moving to a new town, $ENTITY and now celebrating your birthday today... . It's quite an eventful day!... Ah, I'm sorry!... The thought just made me so happy that I got a bit carried away... .
NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY Oh!... , your birthday's on February 29th, right?! $ENTITY This year isn't a leap year... But might as well celebrate a day early, so happy birthday!

NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY So $ENTITY did you find the perfect spot to call home? $ENTITY Yeah! It's OK. Perfect, but...
NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY Wonderful! I'm very happy to hear that! $ENTITY You're in temporary housing for now, right?

NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY Not knowing how much the house will cost is unsettling? $ENTITY And you're currently staying in a tent as well? $ENTITY I'm sure your mood will change once you move into your nice, new home. $ENTITY Don't let the idea of a home loan get to you.

I filled in all I could, $ENTITY but there's just one more thing. $ENTITY Can you tell me when your birthday is, $ENTITY ?
NPC Prologue 5 $ENTITY So, $ENTITY how did things go? $ENTITY Did you find $ENTITY a nice spot to call home? $ENTITY Yeah, it's perfect! It's OK.
