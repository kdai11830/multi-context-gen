GE Dt Museum_Fossil $ENTITY Fossils are crusty in the ground, but they really come to life in here, $ENTITY !
GE Dt Museum_Fossil $ENTITY I wonder.... are these fossils crunchy like a really good snack, $ENTITY ?
GE Dt Museum_Fossil $ENTITY I love standing next to all these dry fossils! It makes me look so fresh, $ENTITY !
GE Dt Museum_Fossil $ENTITY Just thinking about dinosaurs makes me nervous! They'd either stomp on me.... or eat me, right?
GE Dt Museum_Fossil $ENTITY Will I be a fossil someday?... I bet I'd make a cute one, $ENTITY !
