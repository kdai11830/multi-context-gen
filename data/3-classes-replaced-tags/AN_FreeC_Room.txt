AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Mmmmmm! This place is starting to smell just like you! $ENTITY I guess that makes sense. A house usually ends up smelling like the people in it, right? $ENTITY Maybe that goes for my house too.... Heh... That's kind of embarrassing when I think about it, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Heh hee! I can totally imagine you just chilling out here! $ENTITY For real! $ENTITY But could you imagine $ENTITY here? ... Ha ha! Don't know why, but that's a funny image, ... 
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY What do you think is a better cleaning technique: wiping up and down or side to side? $ENTITY Hah! No, I'm not thinking of cleaning up this place. $ENTITY I'm just trying to figure out the fastest way to do my own cleaning at home. $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Stuff gets dusty really quick if you don't keep up with the cleaning!... What the heck is dust anyway? Why can't we just eliminate the source and be done with it? $ENTITY Oh, wait! Forget I said that! I live alone, so I guess I must be the source! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY If you start getting into interior decorating, there's no end to it! ... And it's expensive too! $ENTITY But I'm really impressed when folks make their homes look cool without spending much, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Super-Charged Miracle Soap! $ENTITY That's the stuff they sell on TV late at night, right? $ENTITY Does that stuff actually work? $ENTITY I'm really curious! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room So, uh... Up until recently I thought indirect lighting was some kinda secret or something! $ENTITY It seems like only high-level interior decorators know about it.... Plus it sounds like a ninja technique!
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY You can pick up dust from a carpet using tape! $ENTITY Stick that tape down, peel it off, stick it down, peel it off... Keep on going until you zone out! $ENTITY It's a good way to clear your head when you're riled up, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Having two extra people here makes it feel real lively, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY You know, back home my place was always the main hangout for folks... So I'm used to having lots of peeps around. I wouldn't even mind it if a few more were here!
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Don't be shy! Go ahead and take a load off! $ENTITY Heh, I didn't think anyone from this town knew how to hold back! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Does $ENTITY seem a little on edge to you? $ENTITY Well, with you and me here, maybe we'll help $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY on edge about us, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY Hmmm... This place really suits ... I guess a person's home really reflects their personality, huh? $ENTITY When I think about my own house... Yikes! What is it saying to people? $ENTITY ?
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY likes fussing over guests. $ENTITY I always feel so welcome!
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY You two seem kinda similar somehow... the way you open doors and stuff! $ENTITY But, hey! That's great! They say friends start picking up each other's habits, $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room Can this house really hold this many people? $ENTITY The floor might give out! $ENTITY But that might be kinda funny! $ENTITY It's a bit cramped, but enjoy yourselves! $ENTITY !
AN FreeC Room $ENTITY This many people makes it feel a bit cramped in here... but that's OK! $ENTITY !
