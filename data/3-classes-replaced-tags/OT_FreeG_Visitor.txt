OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY 
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY I love traveling and picking up souvenirs everywhere I go. $ENTITY But I used to have a hard time carrying everything back with me to my hometown. $ENTITY Luckily, $ENTITY they have this new system down at the train station that's incredible! $ENTITY Just put something in a train-station locker in any town, $ENTITY and they'll ship it back to your hometown! $ENTITY I don't know how it works, and I don't care. $ENTITY It's fantastic. $ENTITY You should give it a try!
OT FreeG Visitor ... I'm so happy to hear that.... I'd love to come visit your town sometime as well.
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY That's what I thought you'd say.... Not every town has all the features we boast about in $ENTITY . $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY bountiful fruit trees, $ENTITY a lazy river, $ENTITY ocean views... You have all those things in your town too? $ENTITY Must be a neat place.
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY so you prefer your hometown?... But does it have a Main Street like we have here in $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I see.... 
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, really? $ENTITY But this town has a recycle shop!... Surely you don't have one in your hometown. $ENTITY What? $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY I give up.
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you certainly do speak your mind.... I can respect that. $ENTITY I'm just curious... If you dislike $ENTITY so much, $ENTITY what exactly are you doing here? $ENTITY It must be the $ENTITY trees. $ENTITY Am I right?

OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Dodging the question, $ENTITY are you? $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY that's OK. $ENTITY I suppose you're just trying to spare my feelings. $ENTITY I do wish everyone back there the best.
OT FreeG Visitor $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY please. $ENTITY You're just saying that to make me feel better. $ENTITY I appreciate the thought, $ENTITY but I'd rather have everyone be happy than miss me. $ENTITY Including you, $ENTITY .
