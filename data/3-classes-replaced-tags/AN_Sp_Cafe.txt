AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY People making a ruckus outside always get super quiet and timid when they come in here. It's weird. $ENTITY I guess they must be intimidated by how quiet $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY is. Think so? $ENTITY ?
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Every Friday I come to the caf and look back on the week. Or at least that's my plan. $ENTITY Course I end up just hanging around and not doing any real reflecting at all, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I use Saturday at the caf to come up with an action plan for Sunday. $ENTITY First I relax with a cup of coffee... Aaaaand that's usually as far as I ever get.
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Come here on Sundays, and you can talk with all sorts of weird people. $ENTITY Course if you get too rowdy, you'll get the evil eye from $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's coffee is the perfect thing to wake you up in the morning. $ENTITY I'd like to come in every morning... but I usually end up oversleeping. $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY There's nothing like chilling out during the day with a coffee... It makes me feel so sophisticated! $ENTITY Think about it! Everyone else is outside working themselves to the bone, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Yaaawn... Hanging around here has got me all sleepy. $ENTITY What should I do for dinner? $ENTITY I'll think about that after I wake up with another coffee, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always come here when I've got some thinking to do at night. $ENTITY There are too many distractions at my house, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's coffee is just the thing for an all-nighter! $ENTITY Down one cup, and you'll be up till morning! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always get the $ENTITY Blue Mountain... It's a real high-quality brand known for its rich aroma. $ENTITY Heh. At least that's what $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY just told me, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always have the $ENTITY mocha... I don't really understand all the different flavors, but I like the smell! $ENTITY You should ask $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY if you wanna know more, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I always drink the $ENTITY Kiliman... The real name is $ENTITY Kilimanjaro... but we call it $ENTITY Kiliman $ENTITY around here. $ENTITY We call it that 'cause that's what $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY calls it, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I only drink $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's original $ENTITY blend... It's a real mild, easy-to-drink blend for people like me who aren't used to super-strong coffee. $ENTITY You should ask $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY if you wanna know more, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I definitely like $ENTITY a whole lotta milk $ENTITY in my coffee. $ENTITY A real gentle flavor where you can't really tell where the milk ends and the coffee begins is the best!
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like $ENTITY just enough $ENTITY milk in my coffee. $ENTITY I like it so you get that pretty little swirl going on in the coffee. That's the best, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Just $ENTITY a tiny bit $ENTITY of milk is all you need for coffee. $ENTITY Just enough to soften the flavor of the coffee just a tad! $ENTITY I think it's best that way, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY You've really gotta take coffee without milk to appreciate it. $ENTITY Yeah, black coffee... That's a drink for grown-ups, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like my coffee so sweet that it gives me the shakes, so I always put in $ENTITY 3 sugars $ENTITY . $ENTITY Any more or any less is just not as good, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like my coffee on the sweeter side, so I put in $ENTITY 2 sugars... My coffee is always a lot sweet and a little bit bitter, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I like my coffee to be just a teensy bit sweet and a little bitter, so I only take $ENTITY 1 sugar $ENTITY . $ENTITY But I think that's way better than drinking it $ENTITY black $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY I'm a big fan of the bitter stuff, so I take my coffee with $ENTITY no sugar... Heh! I guess my nickname should be No-Sugar $ENTITY ! My tastes are mature, $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Isn't it weird? When we were kids, coffee was this weird, gross, black liquid. $ENTITY When did you start liking it? $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY !" At birth Just recently
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY So about $ENTITY Brewster... They say he can hear everything that gets said in this place. $ENTITY So no matter how hard we try to be secretive, $ENTITY he hears it all. $ENTITY Like... #x0;
AN Sp Cafe . $ENTITY 1
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY So you skipped right over baby formula and went straight to the coffee? ... Quit kidding around! $ENTITY Man, if some little kid next to me in a caf ordered a black coffee, I'd be totally shocked! $ENTITY Course, if I were a kid ordering coffee in a caf, I'd probably get it black too! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Yep, yep. I know what you mean! $ENTITY Right about that age when you want to act more grown up! $ENTITY I remember thinking it tasted terrible but pretending to like it! $ENTITY It's weird. Once you've faked it for a bit, you actually start to be able to drink it!
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Oh! That's pretty late, huh? $ENTITY But it makes sense. There's not much chance you'll find any really good coffee when you're a kid. $ENTITY You don't want your first cup to be nasty, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Does that mean your first coffee was at $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's? $ENTITY You're lucky! $ENTITY This place has pretty great coffee, so you probably won't like it anywhere else, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Hmmm... Yeah, I get that. One day you're just suddenly able to drink it, and you kind of crave it. $ENTITY I remember when I really wanted to be able to drink it and I just forced myself to get it down.... I think the first coffee that tasted good to me was at $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's. $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Huh? Seriously? So maybe you're not quite used to it yet. $ENTITY You should ask $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY . I'm sure he'll look into finding something to suit you. He may look all cool... but he's relentless about matching people with their perfect coffee! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY 's coffee is the best in the whole wide world! $ENTITY Hey! $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY ! You hear that?
AN Sp Cafe ... 
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY See! $ENTITY Look! He's blushing! $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You can't tell? $ENTITY You just have to look real close. $ENTITY Yeah, right now he's blushing like crazy! $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Hmmm... So today's coffee is just kinda so-so, right? $ENTITY #x4; Brewster $ENTITY ! You hear that?
AN Sp Cafe ... 
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY See! Look how worried he looks!... Huh? You can't tell?... Just look! He's all distraught and stuff! $ENTITY Sorry, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY ! It was just a test! I was only kidding! Coffee's great, as usual, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY The music in here is really fancy! $ENTITY Is this, like, jazz or something? $ENTITY #x4;Brewster $ENTITY ! You hear that?
AN Sp Cafe ... It's not jazz.
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Whoa. He spoke! And it's not jazz! $ENTITY Embarrassing, dude. $ENTITY .
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Spring always makes me want to drink coffee all of a sudden. $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , that spring blend you were working on... What did you end up naming it?
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY This might sound weird, but I always get a hankering for some hot coffee in the summer. $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , that summer blend you were working on... What did you end up naming it?
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY For some reason, the fall always makes me crave coffee. $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , that fall blend you were working on... What did you end up naming it?
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Winter always makes me want some nice, hot coffee. $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY , that winter blend you were working on... What did you end up naming it?
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY 7
AN Sp Cafe ... 
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY No way! Top secret, huh? $ENTITY I hear it means he's got a really good blend going when he doesn't want to talk about it, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe ... Coffee.
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY Huh?! $ENTITY That's it? $ENTITY I mean, that's $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY for you: direct and to the point! And the point is good coffee, $ENTITY !
AN Sp Cafe ... Storm.
AN Sp Cafe $ENTITY What?!... Brewster $ENTITY , is everything OK?! $ENTITY Is it safe to drink? $ENTITY OhmygoshIwantsomerightnow! $ENTITY !
