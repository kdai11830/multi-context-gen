GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... or as I like to call it, the FEASTival! $ENTITY Everyone in town is gonna get a taste of my tasty home cooking!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Gosh, now the panic is starting to set in! I hope I have enough time to finish cooking my food!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Cooking is fun and all, but I thought it'd be a little easier than this! $ENTITY It's, like, a real skill, you know?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ooh! I just realized I need to add some $ENTITY to this dish I'm working on! Think you can get your hands on some, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I'll swap you for a different ingredient! $ENTITY C'mon, do $ENTITY a solid.
GE Ev Harvest Can you help $ENTITY out? I need $ENTITY and I thought ... Don't make me beg! $ENTITY Here you go! Sorry. I'm all out.
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Eek! What am I gonna do? I need $ENTITY or my dish will be absolutely ruined! $ENTITY Heretake mine! Wish I could help you...
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY No hard feelings. I know it's not easy to get your hands on ... .
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Boo! Well, if you come across any, I'll trade you for another ingredient. $ENTITY I got your back, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Aw! Why did you have to get my hopes up like that, $ENTITY ?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Uh, thanks and all.... But what I really need to get my hands on is $ENTITY .
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yay! You've made this $ENTITY so happy. $ENTITY Here. You can have my $ENTITY in return!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY All right! $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY I'd better get back to cooking now.
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Since you helped me out, $ENTITY I'll let you in on one of my cooking secrets...
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY So I heard about this from a friend of a friend of a friend, but it's, like, totally true. Cross my heart! Ready? $ENTITY Lemons $ENTITY . They're the secret weapon! $ENTITY Just a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice and the flavors explode!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY So I came up with this recipe one day when I was nomming on a yummers $ENTITY ... I was, like, how much cooler would it be if you added $ENTITY apple $ENTITY pieces? $ENTITY So much cooler. And crunchier!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY OK, my friend made the yummiest $ENTITY in the whole world! $ENTITY I'm SO not exaggerating. $ENTITY The secret $ENTITY according to my friend, of course $ENTITY is to add a drop of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY ! I just had a brilliant idea. $ENTITY You should totally give that honey trick a try!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY So, like, I've got this friend who's an awesome cook. $ENTITY She made this delicious $ENTITY ! $ENTITY No jokeit was to die for! And you know what made it so yummers? $ENTITY A touch of $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! Who knew? Hey! $ENTITY Maybe you should give that a try, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY So here's the trick to making the best $ENTITY ever! My friend taught me the secret... $ENTITY But I think I can share it with you! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY butter $ENTITY ! Just a tiny little pat of butter! $ENTITY Big secret, right? Anyhoo, you should totally try it out, $ENTITY . $ENTITY I mean, it couldn't hurt, right?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY So my friend taught me how to make killer $ENTITY . No jokeit's crazy good. $ENTITY She said the secret to getting it all mild and yummy is $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY ! Can you believe it? $ENTITY But I can totally see how a little coconut would yum it up, right? $ENTITY You should try it, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I hope there's enough room in my belly to take a taste of all of the food I'm cooking today!
GE Ev Harvest I am, like, utterly pooped from toiling away in a hot kitchen all day. $ENTITY But it's worth it! One taste of this dish, and $ENTITY I bet someone'll offer me my own cooking show! $ENTITY I'll be a star!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Presentation is so important! $ENTITY I gotta make sure my food looks as good as it tastes!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks for swapping ingredients with me. My cooking was totally nom-nom worthy, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks oodles of poodles for trading with me, ... My cooking tastes even better than it normally does, all because of you. $ENTITY Nom nom nom! $ENTITY !

GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Cooking is tough! $ENTITY I know I make it look easy and all. But that's just 'cause I know how to keep my cool! $ENTITY Thanks for all of your help today, $ENTITY . $ENTITY Together we pulled off a successful $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY This $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is all about the YUM. $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY really set the bar high this time, huh?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY This has been the absolute best $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ever! $ENTITY Food and food and food and more food!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is totally, like, one of the best days of the year. $ENTITY There's just sooo much food! $ENTITY But I'm kinda wondering why $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY even bothered showing up... It's not like he cooked anything!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY This has been a totally awesome $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY My tummy is, like, completely stuffed. I'm a little sad that I can't fit any more food in there. $ENTITY Is that crazy or what, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm totally gonna give $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY a big ol' high five next time I see him. $ENTITY He did such a good job! $ENTITY I'm gonna force him to work in my kitchen making me more yummies! $ENTITY Hahaha! Totally kidding about that.
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY It's been a nice $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY and all. But I'm kinda surprised $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY didn't make a main dish! Unless... he DID make a main dish and I never got a bite of it! $ENTITY But that would never happen...
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Is it just me, or was $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's meal a little light on the food this year? $ENTITY Oh, but I'm not complaining. $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I ate enough food to feed an army, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oof! Mmm! My tummy is SOOOO full, it feels like it's about to burst! $ENTITY Of course, I could always cram a little more dessert in there. There's always room for more dessert!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Now, that's what I call a successful $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! Mmm! $ENTITY I should cook more often, don't you think?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY That was, like, the most awesome $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ever! I think I ate my body weight in yumminess! Oof. Maybe I shouldn't dance with such a full tummy. $ENTITY I think I'm gonna explode, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Mmm! That meal was way better than, like, dinner at the trendiest restaurant in the big city. $ENTITY You must be $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's secret weapon, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY His food has never tasted so good, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm so stuffed I can barely move. $ENTITY I guess that's the sure sign of a successful $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY And $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY , like, totally didn't skimp on dessert this year. You've gotta have dessert, right?
GE Ev Harvest I'm literally so stuffed that I can't move a muscle. So full...but so worth it! $ENTITY Hey, you helped $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY cook up that amazing feast, didn't you? $ENTITY I'm so jealous of you, $ENTITY !
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY It sounds kinda fancy, $ENTITY but it's, like, the best. Just make your $ENTITY oysters $ENTITY with a squirt of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice on top! $ENTITY Deeeeelish, right? You've gotta try it sometime. It makes, like, all the difference.
GE Ev Harvest So get this... $ENTITY Mushrooms $ENTITY are totally yummers and all, but when you put 'em in a salad, it gets a little bland. $ENTITY And who wants a bland salad? Not me, that's for sure! $ENTITY That's why I always add a handful of $ENTITY apple $ENTITY pieces to my $ENTITY mushroom salad $ENTITY . $ENTITY You should try it!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Did you know there's a kind of salad made almost entirely out of $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Is that crazy or what? $ENTITY Either way, $ENTITY fruit salad $ENTITY is delicious. Some people only add vinegar... but you need more than that! $ENTITY The real secret is adding a bit of honey straight from the $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It's the only way to go.
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY See, you can't just throw a bunch of stuff in a bowl and call it a salad. $ENTITY Well, I mean, you can... $ENTITY but you shouldn't! Especially when it comes to a $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY . $ENTITY That recipe needs something special! $ENTITY And here's the secret to a delicious $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! Crazy, right? $ENTITY But it really brings out the flavor!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I totally adore $ENTITY fish $ENTITY . I completely adore salad. $ENTITY Then why don't I adore $ENTITY fish salad $ENTITY ? 'Cause of the fishy smell! $ENTITY But I know how to get rid of that icky odor $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Huh? You already knew about the lemon trick?
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I never thought anything could make $ENTITY mushroom bisque $ENTITY more yummers than it already is. $ENTITY But then I discovered $ENTITY butter $ENTITY . $ENTITY Yup, just a little pat gives it that extra oomph, you know? $ENTITY MMMMMM!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY There's one thing that's, like, practically guaranteed to make me drool $ENTITY shellfish chowder $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Just saying it makes me dizzy with hunger! But you can't eat it plain. $ENTITY That would be madness! $ENTITY Nope, you've got to add a little pat of $ENTITY butter $ENTITY . $ENTITY Just enough to give it some creaminess and depth. Yum!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I bet you think there's nothing you could possibly do to make $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY taste any better... $ENTITY But if you add a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice right before serving, it'll really brighten the palate. $ENTITY Deeeeelish!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I got this secret to delicious $ENTITY fruit soup $ENTITY from my favorite magazine, Healthy $ENTITY Weekly. $ENTITY You simmer a bunch of different fruits until they get all gooey and yummers. Doesn't that sound good? $ENTITY But then you've got to add a little squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY ! That's the secret to bringing those flavors together!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that you've gotta take the sweet with the sour! $ENTITY When it comes to cooking up a bowl of $ENTITY tom yum kung $ENTITY , you've already got the sour... $ENTITY So you need to add a little sweet! $ENTITY That's where a dash of $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY milk comes in handy. $ENTITY Just think about itfresh lobster, a bit of $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY you can't get any tastier than that!
GE Ev Harvest Now, if you're cooking with $ENTITY fish $ENTITY , $ENTITY you should definitely add a dash of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY . $ENTITY But the trick is to only use ONE of thosenever both!

GE Ev Harvest Now, if you're cooking with $ENTITY fish $ENTITY , $ENTITY you should sear it first and then add a dash of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY . $ENTITY But the trick is to only use either $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY never both!
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Now, I bet you think I adore all things sweet, but that's not exactly true... When it comes to $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pies, I hate all that syrupy, gooey sweetness. $ENTITY But here's the perfect solution: $ENTITY honey! Just a dab of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY evens out the flavor. $ENTITY That way, you get a dessert that's perfectly sweet and adorable $ENTITY just like little ol' me!

GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY who knows what she wants. $ENTITY And what I want is a pie filled with $ENTITY all sorts of... fruits $ENTITY ! Of course, that can be a dangerous dish. $ENTITY Sometimes, too many fruits means too many flavors! $ENTITY But if you add a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , each flavor really stands out $ENTITY just like me! Give it a try sometime!

GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY if it's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , does that mean I'll be able to snack on a bunch of yummy foods? $ENTITY I sure hope it does! I love it when I get to spend the whole day going "nom nom nom!"
GE Ev Harvest $ENTITY Like, wow! Everyone is holed up in their houses cooking up a storm. $ENTITY Prepare for battle, chefs! $ENTITY I wonder if they'll share any of their extra ingredients. $ENTITY It'd be a shame to let food go to waste!
