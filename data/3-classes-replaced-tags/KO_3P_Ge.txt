KO 3P Ge ... Huh?!... 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , I'm not one to talk, but... you should really watch what you eat!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY You wanna know how to keep your room all clean? $ENTITY That's obvious, isn't it? ... If you use something, you gotta put back something else. $ENTITY If you get something out, you put away whatever you were using before... If you can follow that rule, then the number of things you have out never changes, right? $ENTITY It's that simple!
KO 3P Ge ... Yeah! $ENTITY Your outfit today totally screams $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh. You think so?... Exactly what part makes you think of something like $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY What?... Oh, I don't know!... It's, like, an overall $ENTITY impression I'm getting! $ENTITY Isn't that good enough? Huh?... Prince of $ENTITY Hey, $ENTITY , back me up. Doesn't $ENTITY look like the Prince of $ENTITY today? $ENTITY Yeah, he does! $ENTITY ? Prince...?
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Awesome! $ENTITY All hail the new prince!... Oh, but... maybe you look a bit more like a president than a prince? $ENTITY That'd be cool too! $ENTITY It sounds all official-like either way.... Hail to the chief, President $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... All right, I accept! $ENTITY Make me a president or a prime minister or whatever you want! $ENTITY I'll hear you out until your throat is sore! $ENTITY Unless of course your ideas are dumb.... GAHAHA!... 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY That's got a nice ring to it too! $ENTITY Prince of ... I'm, like, totally a genius! $ENTITY Now, before we continue... Oh man! You don't look like a prince at all! $ENTITY I should have said president! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... Geesh.... And what exactly does this president do, huh? $ENTITY Can you stop getting carried away and talk in a way that normal people can understand,... ?
KO 3P Ge ... Huh?! $ENTITY Should I have gone for something with more power? $ENTITY Do you think I was rude? $ENTITY Hmmmm... $ENTITY Higher than a prince would be... Oh yeah! $ENTITY A king!... I declare that today $ENTITY is the King of $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... A king?!... I'm not really sure what you're going on about, but being a king sounds pretty good to me! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Are you trying to lecture me?... You don't need to worry, because I DO pay attention to what I eat! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY I make sure to eat a lot of different foods to get a totally balanced diet! $ENTITY So, like, I eat $ENTITY in the morning and $ENTITY in the afternoon!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Uh... huh...
KO 3P Ge ... Huh? $ENTITY What's wrong, ... Is all this food talk making you super hungry?
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY No. $ENTITY I just don't really know how to respond to that... 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY After all, I make sure I eat lots of really hot food! $ENTITY Because they say cold food cools you down and... that's bad for your digestion or something? $ENTITY So I always make sure to heat up my $ENTITY before I start eating it!
KO 3P Ge Say... Why don't you give me some advice about foods I already eat on a daily basis? $ENTITY or ... Which is better for you?
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY So basically what you're saying is... to you, those two things are really similar? $ENTITY Hey, ... I'm passing this off to you! $ENTITY Tell her which food is better for her!... ? $ENTITY ? Moderation is key!
KO 3P Ge ... I could totally eat that morning, noon, and night! $ENTITY Thanks! I'll do my best!
KO 3P Ge ... In more ways than one, $ENTITY you're unbelievable! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... I could totally eat that morning, noon, and night! $ENTITY Good idea, $ENTITY !
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Hmmm. You might be right.... Then... after eating $ENTITY , I'll treat myself with some $ENTITY for dessert! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... You're so right!... Wow, $ENTITY , you're, like, super smart!... That makes so much sense to me!83 $ENTITY #x0;
KO 3P Ge Oh, $ENTITY ummmm, isn't there a phrase I can use at times like this? $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY "I've seen the light!"
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Well, look at you!... Never thought I'd see the day when the idea of cleaning made sense to you! $ENTITY Haaaa! $ENTITY All that time I've spent teaching you has finally paid off!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY HA HA HA!... that's not light! That's tears!... 
KO 3P Ge Oh, $ENTITY ummmm, isn't there a phrase I can use at times like this? $ENTITY That's right! $ENTITY "It's like casting pearls before swine!"
KO 3P Ge ... You mean "see the light," right?
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh? $ENTITY Really?... Well, whatever works best! Go with that "light" one! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... This is all an act, right? You're not really this clueless in real life... ?
KO 3P Ge Oh, $ENTITY ummmm, isn't there a phrase I can use at times like this? $ENTITY Oh! That's right! $ENTITY "Use a small fry to catch a big fish."
KO 3P Ge ... I think I get what you're trying to say here. $ENTITY What you mean is, $ENTITY "The scales have fallen from my eyes!"
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY I was so close!... But since they're both fish related... I get some credit for that, right?
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY GAHAHA! $ENTITY Sure!... Besides, I never thought I'd live to see the day you started speaking in idioms!
KO 3P Ge Oh, $ENTITY ummmm, isn't there a phrase I can use at times like this? $ENTITY Something that means "I feel so great now that I know the answer"? ... Ah! $ENTITY It's on the tip of my tongue!... Hey, $ENTITY , do you know what I'm talking about?... "Seen the light"? ... Ask $ENTITY .
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh! That's it! $ENTITY I've seen the light! $ENTITY Awwww, man! $ENTITY That bites! $ENTITY I was so close to remembering it too!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY I never thought I'd hear those words come out of your mouth! $ENTITY All you needed was a few minutes, right?... You were so close! $ENTITY You'll get it next time!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Whoa, $ENTITY thanks! $ENTITY That's so sweet of you!... I'm not going to see light $ENTITY I'm gonna see tears!... 
KO 3P Ge ... Huh?! $ENTITY Why aren't you saying anything? $ENTITY I need your help! $ENTITY Oh, whatever!... Tell me!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Nah! $ENTITY This is a great chance for you to learn something on your own.... go look it up! $ENTITY I'll just stick right by your side until you do.
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY No way!... 
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY Huh?!... I can't do that!... He'll just start to lecture me! $ENTITY 
KO 3P Ge ... Hey! $ENTITY I can hear you! $ENTITY Why do you think I'd lecture you? $ENTITY The reason you can't remember is 'cause you give up too quickly and depend on other people! $ENTITY You should look things up on your own sometimes!
KO 3P Ge $ENTITY See? He's started lecturing me all over again! $ENTITY Why?!...
