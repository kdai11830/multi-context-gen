OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, ... was just explaining what she likes in a best friend. $ENTITY She's notorious for being picky when it comes to friends.... so this should be good.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY I'm the picky one? $ENTITY Well, whatever. $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY , you're more than welcome to listen in! $ENTITY Sure, I'm all ears! Ugh, don't care.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Now, a good friend should be.... Hey, why did you even ask me? Do you want to be best friends?
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Maybe I do, and maybe I don't. $ENTITY Just answer the question!
OT 3P Ge What do you like in a friend? $ENTITY Come on now $ENTITY we're waiting to hear, $ENTITY !
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY OK, fine. $ENTITY I like friends who will tell me that my $ENTITY is the best in the world.... Yeah, even if it tastes like a dirty, ol' $ENTITY . Friends should always be nice like that!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, I guess we'll never be the very best of friends then, will we?... I never flatter my real friends.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY OK, I'll never make you my famous $ENTITY then. $ENTITY So there!
OT 3P Ge What do you like in a friend? Tell us. $ENTITY We're waiting to hear!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY All right then. I like friends who will always let me be better than them at $ENTITY . $ENTITY Yeah, even if they're way better than me, they'll let me shine!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY I guess we'll never be the very best of friends then. $ENTITY I wouldn't be less than perfect for you!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY It's not like you'd ever be better than me at $ENTITY anyway! $ENTITY So.... whatever!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY What? $ENTITY You don't care? $ENTITY But.... but.... I thought everyone wanted to be my best friend. $ENTITY Well, whatever!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, dear, we all want to be your friend.... but you can have only one best friend. $ENTITY Chew on that, OK?
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, you're just in time! $ENTITY was about to tell me about a strange dream she had!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY It's really funny.... or awful, depending on how you look at it, ... 
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY So, $ENTITY it was a hot summer day, $ENTITY and I was having a wild $ENTITY battle with a mysterious stranger.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY On a summer day? $ENTITY That sounds like it could get sweaty!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY So, $ENTITY it was a weird winter's day, $ENTITY and I was having a wild $ENTITY battle with a mysterious stranger.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY On a winter's day? $ENTITY That sounds like it could get really cold!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Anyhoo, $ENTITY we were tied, $ENTITY so we were going to go into sudden death overtime, $ENTITY when someone.... burped! And the referee said.... Oh, $ENTITY yeah, ... I almost forgot that part!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY Me, referee? At your $ENTITY battle?
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Totally! You were there! $ENTITY Anyway, $ENTITY you said that whoever burped lost the battle!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Well, that hardly seems fair. But I'm not a fan of, you know.... surprises like that. $ENTITY Tell us then. $ENTITY Who won?
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY I did, of course! $ENTITY I haven't burped in my whole life. Shows how much you know me!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, please. That hair conditioner you're using is a scam.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY No, it's not! It's made with high-quality $ENTITY to make me shine and sparkle!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY I read in the latest issue of Chic $ENTITY Monthly that it isn't worth the money.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY what do you know? $ENTITY Just check this out.... See, $ENTITY you can't beat THAT kind of sparkle and shine!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY You're being so silly! That's your natural sparkle! $ENTITY Your schmancy conditioner doesn't work!
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY You're just jealous of my sparkle.
OT 3P Ge $ENTITY Jealous? $ENTITY Me?! $ENTITY Well.... I don't think that was sparkle anyway. $ENTITY That was glittery dandruff. $ENTITY Yes, dear, $ENTITY that $ENTITY conditioner is giving you a VERY bad hair day. $ENTITY So there!
