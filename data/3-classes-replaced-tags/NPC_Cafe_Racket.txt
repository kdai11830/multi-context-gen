NPC Cafe Racket Oh, hey,... Thanks for always listening to my little brother. I 'preciate it a lot.
NPC Cafe Racket Hello there,... Nice to see ya again!
NPC Cafe Racket Hey, hey,... It seems like we're always here around the same time! You a big coffee fan?
NPC Cafe Racket You know, $ENTITY I'm a firm believer that a coffee shop should be judged primarily on its house blend. By the way, the $ENTITY blended coffee $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY makes $ENTITY is definitely the best! There's no question!
NPC Cafe Racket I just think it's a shame to add milk to the coffee $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY makes here. $ENTITY I absolutely $ENTITY don't put any $ENTITY in mine.
NPC Cafe Racket Coffee is fine when it's bitter, $ENTITY but I usually put $ENTITY 3 spoonfuls $ENTITY of sugar in my cup. I've got a theory sweet coffee helps relax your body and mind better than the bitter stuff.
NPC Cafe Racket $ENTITY Sonny $ENTITY nags you all the time, $ENTITY doesn't he? $ENTITY Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. $ENTITY Sonny $ENTITY 's a handful. $ENTITY But you know, $ENTITY usually he's always dwelling on something whenever he's by himself. $ENTITY I think he's getting really stressed out about the gap between his job and the changing social trends... 
NPC Cafe Racket $ENTITY Sonny $ENTITY and I are brothers, $ENTITY but even though we eat the same things, $ENTITY we look completely different. My guess is it has a lot to do with the WAY he eats stuff. $ENTITY When I eat,... I chew slowly to relish my food, $ENTITY but when he eats, $ENTITY he's $ENTITY exactly the opposite... . $ENTITY He shovels food into his mouth and chokes it down without chewing properly. $ENTITY He's like a competitive eater! $ENTITY It can't be good for him. $ENTITY Eating fast can be hard on your digestive system. $ENTITY It doesn't do a body good at all! $ENTITY 
NPC Cafe Racket It's nice to have a place like this to enjoy a cup of coffee and relax in.... I'm very grateful! $ENTITY Our bodies would break down if we were all constantly stressed out, $ENTITY never takin' time to relax. If we don't calm down once in a while, we're all headin' for an early retirement. $ENTITY And I don't mean that as a happy sort of retirement, if you get my drift. $ENTITY I'm talkin' dirt nap! $ENTITY Yeah, let that sink in. Maybe you'll relax a bit more. You hearin' me? That's what I thought.
