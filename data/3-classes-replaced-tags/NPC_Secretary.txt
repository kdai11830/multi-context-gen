NPC Secretary Hello, $ENTITY Mayor $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Hello! $ENTITY Welcome to the $ENTITY town hall service counter!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Is there something I can help you with today? $ENTITY &#xF; $ENTITY ( Citizen satisfaction. Town tune. Town flag. Problematic citizens. Nothing.
NPC Secretary All right then. $ENTITY If there is anything I can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh! ... I hope you're settling in well. $ENTITY At the town hall here, we address inquiries about a variety of issues in $ENTITY . So if you have any questions or requests, $ENTITY please don't hesitate to ask!
NPC Secretary Unfortunately, the counter is closed at the moment. $ENTITY I'm sorry, but I hope that you understand. I get so busy when we have visitors or are expecting company, $ENTITY so I can't run the counter at the same time. $ENTITY I'll be more than happy to help you when everything is nice and quiet in town though!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Speaking of which... .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Sorry, but the counter is actually closed right now while we prepare to receive out-of-town visitors. Please come back later when the train station's ticket gate is closed.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Sorry, but the counter is actually closed right now. $ENTITY It closes anytime we have visitors from out of town. If you have questions about $ENTITY , please stop by some other time.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh! Mayor ... Have you settled in and finished unpacking? $ENTITY All done! Not yet.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY Really?!... You must be really efficient when it comes to moving! $ENTITY My bedroom is completely full of unpacked cardboard boxes, and it feels like I moved so long ago! $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I understand. It's a lot of work! $ENTITY My bedroom is still full of unpacked cardboard boxes, and I feel like I've lived there for AGES! $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Sorry! Please don't tell my brother! I don't let him into my room for just this reason!... Ahem! $ENTITY Right!... I was going to tell you about the town hall!
NPC Secretary For starters, right now I'm standing at the service counter. This is the information hub of $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary OK, for starters, the area where I usually stand is the service counter. It's the hub for all $ENTITY info!
NPC Secretary At the service counter, I also take requests to change the town tune or flag design. Oh yeah! I can also provide information about citizen satisfaction. And, of course, $ENTITY I always welcome direct input from our great mayor!
NPC Secretary However, to get advice or provide input, you'll need to stand at the counter just like everybody else. $ENTITY Where you're standing now is perfect, actually!
NPC Secretary However, to get advice or provide input, you'll need to stand at the counter just like everybody else. $ENTITY I can't go bending the rules just because you're the mayor, after all!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Now then, moving on to your responsibilities as mayo... AH! I almost forgot! $ENTITY Before you can start laying out your vision for $ENTITY , you'll need a town-development permit! Getting the permit takes a bit of work, but don't worryI'll help you out! $ENTITY That's what I'm here for! $ENTITY Sounds good! You sound pretty busy.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY I just love your can-do attitude, Mayor $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Me? $ENTITY Busy? $ENTITY Don't worry about it! $ENTITY I got a whole hour of sleep last night, $ENTITY so I'm just raring to go!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Now then, $ENTITY there's a very special chair in the back of this room that's reserved for the mayor.... That's you! $ENTITY When you need to work on official mayoral business, just sit in that chair and I'll help you out!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, look! $ENTITY Your mayoral instincts must be really good,... because you're already sitting in the mayor's chair! $ENTITY When you want to work on official mayoral business, just sit in that chair and I'll help you out!
NPC Secretary Oh! $ENTITY But you know what? $ENTITY I forgot to mention that I $ENTITY can't help you with things when we have or expect visitors to $ENTITY . I just get so busy is all.... I hope you understand and come talk to me when everything is nice and quiet.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY And come see me when I'm not overly busy so we can get started on your town-development permit!
NPC Secretary Is there something you'd like to... inquire about?&#xF; $ENTITY Advice for living here. Citizen satisfaction. Town tune. Town flag. Problematic citizens. Nothing.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Umm... $ENTITY Hi. Did you need something? $ENTITY I know it's silly, but if you want to talk about $ENTITY , you'll need to talk to me over the counter. Or if you want to flex your mayoral muscle, you can sit in the mayor's chair.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You want to know how satisfied the citizens of $ENTITY are?
NPC Secretary Here in $ENTITY , we believe that the citizens deserve to be heard. $ENTITY That's why we've established a committee to gauge the needs of the population! So, $ENTITY without further ado, $ENTITY here are the results of the latest survey... .
NPC Secretary Sure thing! Here's what the citizen- satisfaction committee had to say:
NPC Secretary The survey also says $ENTITY has a good balance between natural areas and developed areas. However, citizens think the town still feels a bit barren overall, so additional development is desired.
NPC Secretary They'd like to see Mayor $ENTITY dedicate more time and resources to public works projects.
NPC Secretary They'd like to see you dedicate more time and resources to public works projects.
NPC Secretary The citizens also say they feel there isn't enough greenery in $ENTITY . They want more plants in the town!
NPC Secretary The citizens also say that they feel $ENTITY is underdeveloped. $ENTITY They want more public works projects!
NPC Secretary In addition, the citizens complained about the cleanliness of town. $ENTITY All the weeds and garbage make them feel like they're "living on a landfill." $ENTITY Their words, not mine.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I know you're not the mayor, but please see what you can do to make $ENTITY even better!
NPC Secretary The fate of $ENTITY lies in your hands, $ENTITY Mayor $ENTITY . $ENTITY I just know you'll do us proud!
NPC Secretary The survey also says the citizens feel $ENTITY is the $ENTITY best $ENTITY town $ENTITY ever! $ENTITY They never want to leave!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Mayor ... You've finally done it! $ENTITY Everyone loves $ENTITY ! $ENTITY On behalf of the citizen-satisfaction committee, I'd like to thank you for all of your hard work. In addition, the committee would like to propose a few special public works projects. They'd like to $ENTITY remodel the town hall $ENTITY and also build a new $ENTITY flower clock... If you're interested in either of these, please consider them for upcoming public works projects! $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary The citizens have been completely satisfied with life in $ENTITY for 15 days straight! To commemorate this event, the citizen-satisfaction committee would like to give you a gift... Please accept this $ENTITY golden can $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Let's both work hard to make sure $ENTITY is always a great place to live!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Let's both do our best to ensure that $ENTITY is always a clean, happy place to live!
NPC Secretary The survey also says that citizens feel that $ENTITY is a good place to live, but it can still be improved. With a little work, $ENTITY could become the best town ever!
NPC Secretary You want to know about $ENTITY 's flag? $ENTITY It's displayed in front of the town hall and inside the train station. $ENTITY Do you have a flag design that really captures the spirit of $ENTITY ?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You'd like to submit a new design for the $ENTITY flag? $ENTITY Great! $ENTITY Please show me the design!
NPC Secretary Oh, you changed your mind?... Well, if there's anything else I can help with, please let me know!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Wow! $ENTITY It's perfect! It really captures the spirit of ... We'll use this design as our new town flag.... Thank you for your excellent submission!
NPC Secretary Well, the ... town tune $ENTITY plays in multiple places around town and serves to tell us what time it is! Our current town tune is OK, but I always like change, so if you have ideas for a new one, let me know! Even if you're not a musician, you should try to compose a theme that captures the essence of $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You want to compose a new $ENTITY town tune? $ENTITY All right!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Allow me. Ahem...
NPC Secretary Um... this town tune is the same as our current one,... isn't it? $ENTITY It's like I always say: $ENTITY if it's not broken, don't fix it!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh my! What a wonderful theme! It's lik $ENTITY music to my ears! $ENTITY Literally! $ENTITY I'm sure this will be a big hit with the townsfolk. $ENTITY We'll start using it right away!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY AH! Mayor ... You came at a great time! $ENTITY Your town-development permit is here!... You can finally get to work!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh! Mayor ... I've been waiting for you! $ENTITY You're finally ready to start work on improving $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary As mayor, you have two primary ways to influence the growth of $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY The first is $ENTITY ordinances... By enacting ordinances, you can change the way $ENTITY is run. $ENTITY Of course, you can't just enact any old ordinance you feel like enacting. $ENTITY That would make you a dictator! Instead, you're able to choose an ordinance out of a list provided to you. Try to choose ordinances that match up with the lifestyles and needs of $ENTITY 's residents.
NPC Secretary The second way to exercise your mayoral power is by starting $ENTITY public works projects $ENTITY . $ENTITY Public works projects add buildings and features to ... I've already taken the liberty of putting together a list of requests from the town citizens... . $ENTITY If there's a request that really speaks to you, $ENTITY please select it to begin development!
NPC Secretary That's all I have for you right now, $ENTITY but when you decide to start on either of those, $ENTITY I'll explain further.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY When you'd like to work on official mayoral business, just sit in your mayor's chair and I'll help you out!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY When you'd like to work on official mayoral business, just sit in that chair and I'll help you out!
NPC Secretary In addition to giving advice, I also provide other services when I'm at my post in the town hall. $ENTITY So let me know if you ever want to change the town tune or flag, or learn about citizen satisfaction!
NPC Secretary I provide a variety of services at the service counter, $ENTITY such as giving people $ENTITY advice for living in town $ENTITY . I also listen to requests to change the town tune and flag, $ENTITY and I report on citizen satisfaction!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's work on ordinances!... At present, there are no ordinances in effect in $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's work on ordinances!... The $ENTITY Beautiful $ENTITY ordinance is currently in effect.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's work on ordinances!... The $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY ordinance is currently in effect in $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's work on ordinances!... The $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY ordinance is currently in effect in $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY let's work on ordinances!... The $ENTITY Bell Boom $ENTITY ordinance is currently in effect in $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary To enact an ordinance, $ENTITY a processing fee of $ENTITY 20,000 Bells $ENTITY is required. $ENTITY Once enacted, ordinances can be canceled for free. Shall we continue? $ENTITY OK! On second thought...
NPC Secretary All right. $ENTITY Let me know if you change your mind!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh, uh... it seems that you're a bit short on funds, Mayor. $ENTITY I should have mentioned that the law says you need 20,000 Bells on hand when changing ordinances.... I'll prepare the necessary forms, so let me know when you have enough Bells.
NPC Secretary Now then, $ENTITY what kind of town would you like $ENTITY to become?&#xF; $ENTITY ( A beautiful town. An early-bird town. A night-owl town. A wealthy town. Never mind.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Great idea, Mayor!... I can see it now...
NPC Secretary $ENTITY A town where flowers live forever $ENTITY and weeds hardly ever grow. $ENTITY And no garbage or cockroaches!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY A town where citizens wake up early $ENTITY feeling refreshed and ready to seize the day!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY A town where the stores stay open late $ENTITY and the citizens socialize until the wee hours of the night!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY A town where the economy is rock solid $ENTITY and you can sell items for more Bells than you can imagine!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY That's your grand vision for $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY Exactly! Not so much.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh ... Well, what kind of town do you want $ENTITY to be then?&#xF; $ENTITY ( A beautiful town. An early-bird town. A night-owl town. A wealthy town. Never mind.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY The... ordinance is already active, $ENTITY so let's keep beautifying $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY ordinance is already active, $ENTITY so let's continue waking up early each and every day!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY ordinance is already active, $ENTITY so let's continue enjoying the local nightlife!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY the $ENTITY Bell Boom $ENTITY ordinance is already active, $ENTITY so let's keep working hard to boost the town's economy!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK! So you want to sign the ... ordinance into law... Let's do it! I changed my mind.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK! So you want to sign the $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY ordinance into law... Let's do it! I changed my mind.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK! So you want to sign the $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY ordinance into law... Let's do it! I changed my mind.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY OK! So you want to sign the $ENTITY Bell Boom $ENTITY ordinance into law... Let's do it! I changed my mind.
NPC Secretary Gotcha. $ENTITY Signing legislation is a big deal, so you should think it over carefully.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Then it's official! The ordinance will go into effect tomorrow morning! $ENTITY I'll let the townsfolk know.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I see... If that's the case, $ENTITY let's circle back once your vision for $ENTITY is crystal clear!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I see... Well, $ENTITY do you want to cancel the current ordinance, or do you want to keep it? $ENTITY Keep it. Cancel it.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Understood! $ENTITY We'll leave things the way they are for now!
NPC Secretary I'll get right on it! $ENTITY The cancellation should go into effect by tomorrow morning. $ENTITY By the way, $ENTITY there's no extra fee for dropping an ordinance, as it's built in to the original ordinance fee.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I'm still working on the paperwork for a new ordinance. It should be all ready by tomorrow morning.
NPC Secretary Mayor ... I haven't heard anything back yet about your town- development permit. $ENTITY It'll take one day at the very least to get it approved, but it could take a few days longer... . $ENTITY I'll let you know as soon as it goes through, $ENTITY so don't worry!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Hi, $ENTITY . Mayor! $ENTITY Is there something I can help you with? $ENTITY Development permit. No, thanks.
NPC Secretary Hi, Mayor ... Is there something I can help you with? $ENTITY ( Public works projects. Ordinances. Nothing, thanks.
NPC Secretary Is there anything else $ENTITY I can help you with right now, Mayor? $ENTITY ( Public works projects. Ordinances. Maybe later.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Ooh! Public works projects are exciting! Allow me to explain the fascinating process. $ENTITY First, choose a project you'd like to work on from the list of requests citizens have made. $ENTITY Once you've chosen a project, we'll go search for a place to build it!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Once we've found a spot for it, we'll need to raise the construction funds by asking for donations. Then, after we've collected enough donations to fully fund the project, $ENTITY the structure will be built! $ENTITY Please keep in mind that we only have the resources to work on one public works project at a time. Well then, $ENTITY let's dive right in!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Here are the current requests from the townspeople.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh, nothing for now then?... OK, $ENTITY that is totally fine.
NPC Secretary Would you like to start work on the $ENTITY Let's do it! Not now.
NPC Secretary You won't be able to demolish the $ENTITY project once it's finished. $ENTITY #xE; $ENTITY Let's do it! Not quite yet.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Yay! $ENTITY Let's go find a place to build!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Great! Maybe we should have the donation gyroid sit inside the train station this time?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Yay! $ENTITY I'm s... excited! It's long overdue, if you ask me! $ENTITY Considering this is the place we're remodeling, why don't we just have the donation gyroid set up here?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Great news, Mayor ... We've met our collection goal for the $ENTITY project! $ENTITY It should be complete tomorrow! $ENTITY Why don't you take the rest of the day off? You've earned it!
NPC Secretary Sorry, $ENTITY Mayor. $ENTITY I'm trying to get the $ENTITY project canceled, so my schedule is full. $ENTITY Any new projects will have to wait until tomorrow. Sorry about that!
NPC Secretary Ugh. $ENTITY I'm so swamped with work right now. $ENTITY I'm setting up the demolition of the $ENTITY project, so I don't have time for anything else. $ENTITY Any new projects will have to wait until tomorrow. Sorry about that!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You want to work on a public works project? $ENTITY I'm happy to help!
NPC Secretary We're currently collecting donations for the $ENTITY project. We can't start a new project until the current one is finished, $ENTITY but can I help you with something else? $ENTITY Stop donations. Demolish a project. Not at the moment.
NPC Secretary We're currently collecting donations for the $ENTITY project. We can't start a new project until the current one is finished, but $ENTITY can I help you with something else? $ENTITY Stop donations. No, thanks.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY There isn't any room in town for a new project, $ENTITY but can I help you with something else? $ENTITY Demolish a project. No, thanks.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY What would you like to work on? $ENTITY Start a new project. Demolish a project. Nothing.
NPC Secretary You want to demolish something? $ENTITY Well, that's unfortunate, but I suppose it's necessary sometimes. Please let me know what you want to demolish from this list.
NPC Secretary You've changed your mind? $ENTITY Well, let's just forget this conversation ever happened then!
NPC Secretary It will cost $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY to destroy the $ENTITY . $ENTITY Are you sure you want to do this? $ENTITY No, I want to keep it. Yeah, tear it down!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh my... You don't have enough Bells to pay for the demolition, Mayor. We can't ask for donations to cover the demolition fee, so it'll have to come from your own pocket.
NPC Secretary I, $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY , hereby affirm that I have received $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY from you for the purpose of demolition. We'll demolish it overnight so that the town is neat and tidy by the time the residents wake up.
NPC Secretary Whoa... . You'd like to cancel the $ENTITY I'm sure you have your reasons. $ENTITY By law, the donations cannot be returned to the donors. $ENTITY You're sure you want to cancel it? $ENTITY No, leave it be. Yes, please cancel it.
NPC Secretary Understood.... I'll make sure that the project is completely stopped by tomorrow morning.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I'm pretty sure I mentioned this to you before... but the cost for all of $ENTITY 's public works projects are covered entirely by donations. $ENTITY Of course, you're more than welcome to donate your own money as well, Mayor! $ENTITY Truth be told... if you don't, $ENTITY I get the feeling it'll take a lot longer to gather up all the money we'll need.... Thanks in advance for your help and cooperation!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY You wanted to work on official mayoral business today? $ENTITY But what about today's event? We can't sit here in this stuffy office building while the rest of the town is enjoying the festivities! It's not healthy to work so much, Mayor! $ENTITY Why don't you just take the day off instead?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Zzzzzz... AHHHH! $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY }Mayor ... 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY It's not what it looks like! $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY it's exactly what it looks lik... But I was dreaming about work!... I promise!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Ooh! $ENTITY That reminds me! $ENTITY We had a visitor earlier who suggested a new public works project. She wants us to put a Dream Suite on Main Street where you can take naps with vivid dreams!... Cool, huh? $ENTITY She needs support from the town before it can open, $ENTITY so this is where you'd be a big help.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I'll go ahead and add it to the list of public works projects under the name $ENTITY Dream Suite... 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, if it isn't Mayor $ENTITY from ... Welcome to our fair town!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well now, would you look who it is!... from $ENTITY , right?... Welcome to our fair town!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Please enjoy $ENTITY today!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I hope you're enjoying your stay in $ENTITY so far. Please make yourself at home!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY If I get some time off, I'd like to visit $ENTITY sometime. $ENTITY I hear there's a really nice young secretary working there who's supposed to be stunningly beautiful. $ENTITY Hmm... I wish I could be that beautiful someday.
NPC Secretary I love your enthusiasm, Mayor, but why don't we prioritize getting your house built first? I'm sure you're ready to move out of that tent, and it needs to be done before you can get your permit.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, your house isn't ready yet, but you've paid your down payment, so that's good. $ENTITY However, in order to receive your development permit, you'll need an approval rating of 100 percent. According to a recent survey of the townsfolk, your mayoral approval rating is at $ENTITY percent $ENTITY . $ENTITY Hm. Let me think of a good way for you to gain the citizens' approval...
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Your house isn't ready yet, but according to a recent poll, your approval rating $ENTITY is $ENTITY 100 percent $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So now all we can do is wait for your house to be finished. $ENTITY Provided you've already paid the down payment, your house should be ready by tomorrow!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Hi, Mayor ... Let me guessyou'd like to work on the application for your town- development permit! $ENTITY Well then, let me explain the prerequisites for the permit. $ENTITY The first requirement is that you $ENTITY own a house $ENTITY in town!
NPC Secretary You're still living in a tent, so you'll need to put together the down payment for a house first.
NPC Secretary Since you already own a house, $ENTITY you're all set there!
NPC Secretary OK, $ENTITY the second requirement for the town-development permit is to $ENTITY gain the approval of the citizens $ENTITY ! In order to gauge citizen approval, $ENTITY I'll regularly survey the townsfolk to see what they think of you. The best way to raise your approval rating is to improve the town and the lives of those who live here! Now, $ENTITY according to a preliminary survey, $ENTITY your current approval rating is $ENTITY percent $ENTITY . The law requires that all applicants have a $ENTITY 100 percent $ENTITY approval rating,... so let's make that our goal!
NPC Secretary Talk to me from your mayor's chair anytime you want to know what your approval rating is. I can also give you advice on how to raise your approval rating. $ENTITY That's all there is to it! Good luck, Mayor $ENTITY !
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You'd like to know how much progress you've made toward getting the development permit? $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, your house isn't finished yet, $ENTITY and according to a recent survey, your approval rating is $ENTITY percent $ENTITY . $ENTITY Why don't you begin by paying the down payment on your house? $ENTITY I'm sure it shouldn't be too hard to earn the money for a down payment.... Good luck!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, your house isn't finished yet... $ENTITY But according to a recent citizen survey, $ENTITY your approval rating has reached $ENTITY 100 percent $ENTITY ! Congrats! So all that's left is collecting the down payment on your house! $ENTITY Good luck, $ENTITY Mayor!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, you already own a house, and according to a recent survey, your approval rating is $ENTITY percent $ENTITY . $ENTITY So all you need to do now is gain the approval of the citizens! $ENTITY Hm. Let me think of a good way for you to gain their approval...
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well, $ENTITY you already own a house, $ENTITY and... Wait a minute! $ENTITY According to a recent citizen survey, $ENTITY your approval rating is... 100 percent... Wow! $ENTITY Mayor ... #x0; $ENTITY I'll submit your application for the town-development permit right away! $ENTITY The approval process will take one day at the very least, but it could take up to a few days. $ENTITY If you could come by and check on its approval status from time to time, I'd really appreciate it!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh! $ENTITY Is there a citizen who's troubling you? $ENTITY Yeah. Nope.
NPC Secretary Phew! That's a relief.... I don't like confrontation... $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary Which citizen seems to be causing all the trouble?
NPC Secretary What don't you like about $ENTITY &#xF;... language is rude. $ENTITY clothes are wrong. ... #x0; has a naughty letter. Never mind.
NPC Secretary Oh my... So $ENTITY hasn't been speaking politely lately?
NPC Secretary Oh my... So $ENTITY hasn't been dressing very nicely lately?
NPC Secretary Oh my... So $ENTITY is carrying around a bad letter?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Do you want me to ask $ENTITY to stop this behavior? I have the authority to do that, you know. $ENTITY Yes, make ... #x0; $ENTITY stop! Nah, it's fine.
NPC Secretary OK, but if a citizen is breaking the rules, please let me know so I can make him or her knock it off.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Say no more. $ENTITY I'll make sure to wash $ENTITY 's mouth out with soap. $ENTITY Just kidding! $ENTITY That would be gross!... But seriously,... I'll have a stern talk with ... #x0; $ENTITY .
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Say no more. I'll make sure $ENTITY changes $ENTITY clothes right away. $ENTITY I should make ... #x0; $ENTITY have to wear a barrel for a day to learn to respect the clothes on $ENTITY back! $ENTITY Hee hee, $ENTITY I'm only kidding!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Say no more. I'll make sure that $ENTITY disposes of $ENTITY naughty letter right away.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Oh, Mayor!... I just remembered! $ENTITY The townsfolk would like to hold a ceremony to celebrate completing the $ENTITY project. And considering you're the one who made all this possible, $ENTITY we want you to attend! $ENTITY What do you say? $ENTITY I'd be happy to! I'm gonna pass.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY I was really hoping you'd say that!... Because I kind of already finished the preparations. $ENTITY Heh...... All right, then let's head to the site of the ceremony, shall we?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Hooray! $ENTITY We're going to hold the ceremony in front of the town hall this time, $ENTITY and it starts right now, so, $ENTITY uh...... SURPRISE! $ENTITY Heh...
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Hooray! $ENTITY The ceremony will be held outside at the train station, $ENTITY so can you please come with me?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY You can't make it?! $ENTITY Well, I guess I'll have to attend the ceremony in your place. $ENTITY I hope the townsfolk aren't too disappointed.
NPC Secretary Ahem... Hello everyone! $ENTITY Welcome to the grand completion ceremony for $ENTITY 's vital $ENTITY project! $ENTITY Thank you for joining us for this momentous occasion. $ENTITY I'm $ENTITY Isabelle... and I'll be your host today!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Thank you. $ENTITY Thank you. $ENTITY You're too kind! $ENTITY We're going to keep this short and sweet, so let's jump right in. $ENTITY First up, we have an incredibly short speech from our very own mayor!... Take it away, Mayor ... , We did it! Hooray for everyone! On to the next project!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Well said, $ENTITY Mayor! $ENTITY You have quite a way with words... OK, moving on... $ENTITY Everybody, please locate that item we passed out earlier and get ready.
NPC Secretary And now... To celebrate the completion of this public works project... $ENTITY and all the hard work that made this possible... READY? $ENTITY SET! $ENTITY POP! $ENTITY 
NPC Secretary That concludes our ceremony! $ENTITY Thanks, everyone, for all of your hard work $ENTITY and for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Why don't you try mingling with the town citizens? $ENTITY Nothing builds trust like good old face time! It should be easy, $ENTITY because everyone in town is very interested in getting to know their new mayor! $ENTITY Sure, some of them will ask favors of you, $ENTITY but as long as you just smile and nod, $ENTITY it'll be a piece of cake! $ENTITY OK, $ENTITY you should probably actually help them,... but make sure to do it with a smile on your face!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY How about cleaning up the town?... It'll send a message to the citizens that you care about $ENTITY ! Ooh, try this: while fishing, you'll sometimes pull up garbage, which makes the ocean and rivers cleaner! But make sure to take any trash you find to the recycle shop so they can dispose of it properly. You don't want people to think you don't actually care about the environment, after all.
NPC Secretary $ENTITY How about pulling up any weeds around town? $ENTITY After all, no one likes weeds. Just keep an eye out for them while you're strolling around town, and pull up any you see. Easy peasy!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY How about watering any flowers around town? $ENTITY It'll show the citizens that you care about $ENTITY . Plus, $ENTITY people just love seeing public officials get their hands dirty! $ENTITY Just water any flowers around town that aren't looking too hot. $ENTITY Or any that ARE looking too hot, $ENTITY I guess!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY That's it! $ENTITY You could send a message to the town citizens via the $ENTITY bulletin $ENTITY board $ENTITY in front of the train station! $ENTITY You can use the bulletin board for whatever you want, so why not post a friendly hello as their mayor? $ENTITY It could be an excellent forum to introduce yourself and tell them your plans for $ENTITY 's future!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Why not compose a new $ENTITY town tune $ENTITY for the town? $ENTITY Everybody loves a catchy jingle! $ENTITY Every time the citizens hear it, they'll think about you and how much you care about $ENTITY ! Just talk to me at the service counter to try your hand at composing a new town tune!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Got it! You can design a new town flag for ... The flag flies in front of the town hall and inside the train station, $ENTITY so everyone will see it! Just tap on the Touch Screen to start your design. Then see me at the counter to submit the design!
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Um, why not make a donation to the $ENTITY local museum $ENTITY ? $ENTITY The townsfolk would really respect that! You should really visit the museum, if you haven't already. It's located on the edge of the shopping district. It's really great. It holds things like bugs, fish, fossils, and works of art. $ENTITY And it's all items donated by the citizens of $ENTITY , so why don't you donate something as well?
NPC Secretary $ENTITY Ooh! Why don't you sell some stuff at the recycle shop? $ENTITY If you haven't been to the $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY recycle shop yet, you should really check it out. Selling stuff at the recycle shop is much better for the environment than simply throwing it away. Plus, recycling will set a good example for the rest of the town, and the people will love you for it!
NPC Secretary There you have it! If you follow that advice, you'll have a $ENTITY 100 percent approval rating $ENTITY in no time!
