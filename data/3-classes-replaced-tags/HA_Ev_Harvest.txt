HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today I'm going to try as hard as I can to make a delicious dish!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today I'm gonna put my cooking muscles to use and make the best dish ever, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest I've cooked before, you know. $ENTITY It did not go well, ... #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;d... Cooking is difficult!
HA Ev Harvest The dish I'm working on could really use a touch of ... I gotta have that one special ingredient to make my cooking pop!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Hey! I know you brought me the $ENTITY I asked for, right?! $ENTITY Sure! Right here! I kinda forgot...
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY All gone! $ENTITY All gone! $ENTITY All gone! $ENTITY How am I out of $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY Take mine! I'm out too!
HA Ev Harvest No $ENTITY ?! Well, if you get some, let's make a deal. Tradezies? $ENTITY ?
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I've gathered various ingredients to prep for the big holiday. $ENTITY We should maybe see if we have any mutually beneficial trades we could make! $ENTITY ?
HA Ev Harvest Hey! Don't play with my emotions!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Yeah... That's not what I need. $ENTITY I believe I asked you for some ... Come on, $ENTITY ! Come through for me!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY All right! Thank you! With this, I will concoct a mind-blowing dish! $ENTITY How about taking my $ENTITY in return?
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I can't believe how much I enjoy cooking! It's really fun, and it's a good upper-arm workout! $ENTITY Alrighty! $ENTITY What should I make next, $ENTITY ?
HA Ev Harvest I feel like I should start a cooking- workout show, $ENTITY . I've got lots of good cooking advice!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Like, if you're trying to make $ENTITY , add a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to it for the zing factor. $ENTITY You'll be making amazing meals like me in no time, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The best way to make $ENTITY is with some crisp, fresh $ENTITY apples... You can't beat that crunchy, appley texture, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I like to add a little honey straight from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY to my favorite ... It's always nice to come across such a rare ingredient... Once you taste it, $ENTITY you know it was worth the trouble, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I found out that $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY is a great addition to ... Try it out!... Just be sure to give me credit for discovering the secret! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY When making $ENTITY , you gotta add $ENTITY butter $ENTITY , ... I think that's how my mom used to make it... Try it out for yourself!
HA Ev Harvest If you're going to make the best $ENTITY ever, you need some tropical $ENTITY coconuts $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It takes some of the edge off the $ENTITY spiciness and makes it really tasty! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh?!... I smell something amazing! $ENTITY Darn it! I've got to make something even better than whatever that is!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I made a lot of dishes today! $ENTITY I guess I'm pretty talented when it comes to cooking! $ENTITY From now on, call me Foodmaster $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest Cooking takes a lot of energy! $ENTITY Good thing I train so hard all the time, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I'm glad we swapped ingredients! You really helped me out! $ENTITY It's true what they say. You can't make stuff without ingredients! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest ... Thanks for sharing your ingredients with me earlier! $ENTITY Thanks to you, I was able to cook my favorite dish, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Did you know today is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival... I'm gonna try to whip up something special!
HA Ev Harvest It's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , one of the rare occasions when I actually cook. $ENTITY But ugh... I'm kind of falling behind this year... .
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , so I'm busy getting a dish together! No time to chat, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was so lively!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I ate so much today! Maybe a nice, long run will help my digestion?
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Cooking is really a profound experience. $ENTITY I'm just starting to understand it!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Thanks to you, I was able to finish my dish without any trouble! $ENTITY Thanks, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest I think cooking requires more stamina than sports! $ENTITY I'm exhausted! $ENTITY But I'm glad I could make such a delicious dish. $ENTITY Thanks again for your help with that!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was fun, but it sure was a tough event to prepare for! $ENTITY It made me realize how amazing my mom was, always cooking for me and stuff!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is really fun, because a bunch of different people make a bunch of yummy dishes. $ENTITY Sometimes the people you'd least expect are the most amazing cooks! $ENTITY 
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was really fun! $ENTITY Actually, I was looking forward to trying out $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking, but... Next year I'll have to try it for sure!
HA Ev Harvest Today's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was a little lacking, don't you think? $ENTITY And what was up with $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY ?! $ENTITY I feel like he cut a few corners this year!
HA Ev Harvest I thought I'd be able to sample a bit more of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking, but the festival is pretty much over. Hmm... Next year I'm going to eat until I burst!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking is so specialized... I'd kind of like to see a menu with a little more variety, $ENTITY .
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was pretty lively this year! $ENTITY But what about $ENTITY Franklin... I don't think he gave it his best shot. $ENTITY Next time I hope he makes the main dish!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Whew! I think I ate more than anyone in town. $ENTITY Now if only we had dessert, that would be awesome! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oh, man. I ate so much! $ENTITY I better do something to make up for all the food I ate today... Starting tomorrow I'm doing a triple dose of every exercise in my training regimen, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's dish was amazing! $ENTITY I feel like the delicate flavorings he went with really complemented the masculine style of my cooking. $ENTITY And you helped out, $ENTITY ! Nice job with the assist!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Wow! It's not every day you get to taste such yummy food! $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY isn't a macho guy, $ENTITY but he sure brings passion to his cooking! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Whew! My stomach is bursting thanks to $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking! $ENTITY I didn't know what to do when dessert came out. $ENTITY So I just started gobbling it down super fast! $ENTITY Luckily, I've been doing tons of crunches lately, so my tummy can handle the extra stress! $ENTITY 
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY You were helping $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY , right? $ENTITY Nice work! Everything was great!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Oysters $ENTITY are even better when you squirt $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on them. $ENTITY It helps take away the distinctive odor and makes them easier to eat! $ENTITY It's the ultimate secret weapon when you're making a dish that calls for oysters!
HA Ev Harvest Salads that mainly use $ENTITY mushrooms $ENTITY can be tricky. $ENTITY But I've found that $ENTITY apples $ENTITY work well in that situation! $ENTITY The crunchy texture combined with the sweetness is a nice accent. $ENTITY If you get a chance to make something, don't forget to add apples as a nice secret ingredient!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Fruit $ENTITY is good eaten just by itself, but I recommend putting it in salad. $ENTITY Some folks add vinegar to salads for a bit of tang. $ENTITY But fresh honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY is amazing! $ENTITY You only need a little bit, though. $ENTITY Too much turns a fruity salad into a dessert! $ENTITY 
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Vinegar $ENTITY goes well on salads that use a lot of different ingredients. $ENTITY Its tangy flavor nicely fuses the flavors of the other ingredients! $ENTITY Yeah! $ENTITY Vinegar $ENTITY is great for $ENTITY mixed salads $ENTITY ! $ENTITY There's no doubt about it, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you use plain fish in $ENTITY fish salad $ENTITY , it just ends up smelling fishy... So what you need to use is $ENTITY lemon... Lemon punches that fishy smell right in the face! Amazing, isn't it? ... Don't forget! Fish plus salad plus lemon equals knockout win!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Dishes with $ENTITY mushrooms $ENTITY are great this time of year, ... A nice bisque with a few kinds of mushrooms served nice and warm $ENTITY can be delicious! $ENTITY Throw in a chunk of $ENTITY butter... and boom! Food master in the house!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Soup with $ENTITY clams $ENTITY reminds me of seaside clambakes. It's so good! $ENTITY But if you toss in a little $ENTITY butter $ENTITY , the soup is even more delicious! $ENTITY Clams and butter, clams and butter. It's the ultimate combination of awesome ingredients, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Fish $ENTITY soup tastes delicious and has a nice consistency to it. I love it! $ENTITY The key is adding just a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY . It gets rid of that fishy odor and goes down nice and easy.
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Fruit $ENTITY is a really great base for soup! $ENTITY Plus, I just like the sound you get when you boil fruit! $ENTITY And if you add just a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , you get a nice citrus kick that makes it really tasty!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY If you add sweetness to hot dishes, it tones down the spiciness and just makes them all-around delicious! $ENTITY For example, $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY in $ENTITY tom yum kung $ENTITY makes for a perfect combination, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY But you need to go diving for the freshest-possible lobster to make good $ENTITY tom yum kung... It's quite a chore, $ENTITY but it's totally worth it because it's so good!

Essential, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;! $ENTITY But I'm never sure which one to use in particular situations... That's where your kitchen-intuition muscles are tested, $ENTITY . I call that "inkuitchen."

HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Huh? Why am I not making anything for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY right now? $ENTITY You think I'm a mooch, $ENTITY ? $ENTITY That's not how it is! It's just that when you're super hungry, stuff tastes better, right? $ENTITY At the moment, I'm just trying to work up a good appetite! $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Everyone's cooking! $ENTITY You should see if you can help. $ENTITY I took a peek earlier, and it seemed like a few folks were in desperate need of some ingredients!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY over in the plaza looks like he might be a master of the culinary arts... whatever that means. $ENTITY All I know is I can't wait to gobble down anything he makes, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Ha ha! $ENTITY smells really good today, doesn't it?! $ENTITY It's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , so everyone is inside cooking up a storma food storm! $ENTITY I'm doing some warm-up exercises $ENTITY before I get cooking, ...

HA Ev Harvest Ahhh, $ENTITY Harvest Festival... What a great time to pig out! $ENTITY Belch... Oops! Maybe I should stop. I think I might be full enough... .
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY Searching for ingredients was a lot harder than I thought it would be! $ENTITY Good thing I'm strong! It took a lot of muscle, $ENTITY !
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY I thought I'd see a wider variety of dishes this year... Oh well. No big deal! $ENTITY The important thing is that we keep our little tradition alive! $ENTITY As long as people have a good time, I'm good with it!
HA Ev Harvest $ENTITY The salad $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY made was really good! $ENTITY But it's weird that all we got was health food, right? ... I mean, I'm all for healthy eating, but it seems like it's OK to go a little crazy on a holiday like this.
