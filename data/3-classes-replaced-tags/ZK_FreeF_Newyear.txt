ZK FreeF Newyear We rodents get a pretty bad rap for being "disease-ridden little balls of gnarly hate."... I hate it! $ENTITY I'm not a bad guy! $ENTITY I wash regularly, get my shots, pay my loans, even say hello in a friendly way! Oh well.... At least people are talking about me.... Better than not talking about me at all, $ENTITY so happy new year!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY The calendar shifts to a new year, but I'm not content to just sit around and wait for the next one. $ENTITY Nope! $ENTITY This year,... I'm finally going to figure out how to speed time along! $ENTITY Then we get right back to holidays! $ENTITY Shouldn't be too difficult, really. $ENTITY I mean,... I'm a strong guy, $ENTITY and time seems pretty flimsy. $ENTITY One good punch should solve that whole "space-time continuum" problem right up! $ENTITY Then once we bovines control time, $ENTITY maybe someone ELSE will have to handle the milk supply! $ENTITY So $ENTITY that's just a little snippet from my graphic novel.... It's still in the rough stages.
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Tigers are awesome. $ENTITY I don't even want to argue this fact with you, because I don't feel the need. Plus,... we tigers have a bad habit of losing our cool when backed in a corner, and you don't want that. I once had a guy come to my door trying to sell me some magazine subscriptions. $ENTITY I kept saying no, but he just wasn't listening, $ENTITY just repeating, $ENTITY "no, really, you want some magazines."... Well, I was having none of that,... so I unleashed the tiger!... Yup, just closed the door right in his face. I felt bad afterward, $ENTITY so I bought 37 subscriptions, $ENTITY but, man,... I really hated my outburst of insanity.
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY I love New Year's, but my parents inevitably sent me another huge batch of carrots. $ENTITY They just keep watching the news every night and get fed the same old carrot agenda, which is sad. $ENTITY Rabbits need more than carrots!... Everyone assumes otherwise, but it's the truth!... Oh well. $ENTITY Food's food.
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Look,... This year $ENTITY I'm gonna keep running until I can't run anymore! $ENTITY After all, $ENTITY what better time than the present?... No one's gonna stable this horse! $ENTITY Hah ha!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Finally... I think sheep will really take the spotlight this year... Maybe it's just a hunch. $ENTITY But then again, it makes a ton of sense. Everyone loves sheep! $ENTITY About time we got credit!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY The new year makes me want to dance until I pass out... but that's never enough for people! $ENTITY They just assume us monkeys are always ready to perform,... but we're not! $ENTITY We need rest like anyone else! $ENTITY Sure, $ENTITY if I had anything left in the tank, I'd keep going,... but these monkey feet have limits!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You see this face?... This will be the face you associate with $ENTITY ! $ENTITY And why is that, you may ask? $ENTITY How could you NOT?! $ENTITY Look at the perfect angles!... The blemish-free skin!... The powerful features! $ENTITY I'm the complete package!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY The year's just begun, and already I have an insatiable urge to $ENTITY wag my tail like it's nobody's business! $ENTITY I have a good feeling about what's right around the corner, $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Look out, world!... is here!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY You looking forward to your New Year's dream,... The very next dream you have after the new year is supposed to be really important, you know... What, me?... I'm always dreaming,... even when I'm wide awake... 
ZK FreeF Newyear Oh boy, I get so anxious when a new year starts. $ENTITY It's fun, but there's so much I have to get done! $ENTITY And when I say that, $ENTITY I really mean there's a lot I need your help to do. $ENTITY You know how it works!
ZK FreeF Newyear ... My New Year's resolution? $ENTITY Let's see... I thought about it a lot, $ENTITY and what I want to do most this year... is dance,... !
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY They often say you gotta eat something really fancy and cultural for New Year's... But I sort of just feel like eating a juicy ... Woo! $ENTITY Hometown pride!
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY There's so much we get to do during New Year's. $ENTITY Everything's a first when you do it today! $ENTITY That's what makes the new year so much fun! $ENTITY Now, what should I do first for the new year? Maybe I should write a blog? But what would I title it... 
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY : The Hero of Time. $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Doesn't sound right... 
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY Between $ENTITY and a Hard Place. $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY Hmm. $ENTITY Not quite... 
ZK FreeF Newyear $ENTITY and the New Year. $ENTITY No, $ENTITY that's not it...
