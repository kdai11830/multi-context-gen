NPC Perio Good morning, Mayor $ENTITY !
NPC Perio Good morning, $ENTITY !
NPC Perio $ENTITY Take a look in your mailbox. $ENTITY I may have dropped a little something in there for you.
NPC Perio $ENTITY As you can see, I'm busy delivering the mail this morning.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Phew! $ENTITY I swear... $ENTITY huff... $ENTITY these people are mailing bricks to each other just to spite me.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Ya... awn $ENTITY ... $ENTITY I was up late last night thinking about $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY . $ENTITY Why do I always do this to myself? $ENTITY Delivering the mail is my livelihood, so I can't afford to be tired.
NPC Perio Good evening, Mayor!
NPC Perio Hi there, $ENTITY .
NPC Perio $ENTITY Have you checked your mailbox?... I just delivered a letter for you.
NPC Perio The evening shift is always the hardest. $ENTITY It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it!
NPC Perio As soon as I clock out, I'm going to eat this fish I've been keeping in my bill pouch. $ENTITY 
NPC Perio Man, time flies when you're not using your wings. $ENTITY It's already evening, for Pete's sake! $ENTITY Ha! Get it?! $ENTITY "For Pete's sake." $ENTITY Because of my name? $ENTITY Ha ha ha! $ENTITY Oh, man. $ENTITY I crack myself up. $ENTITY Anyway... . $ENTITY I wonder what $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY is doing tonight. Probably working. $ENTITY Oh, erm... $ENTITY Sorry. I get kind of loopy toward the end of my shift. $ENTITY Catch ya later!
NPC Perio $ENTITY AHHH! $ENTITY I'm behind schedule! Gotta get a move on!
NPC Perio $ENTITY Wow, this mailbag is HEAVY! $ENTITY Haven't these people ever heard of a phone conversation?
NPC Perio I can't make out the address on this letter because the handwriting is so sloppy. Not that I'm surprised. Most of the town's residents don't even have opposable thumbs.
NPC Perio $ENTITY No time to talk! $ENTITY Gotta get the rest of these letters delivered!
NPC Perio Sure, e-mail and text messages might be faster, more convenient, and better for the environment. $ENTITY But there's nothing quite like receiving a handwritten letter in the mail. That's why I do it!
NPC Perio Whenever I see a letter that came from overseas, I think to myself: $ENTITY "Wow, the bird who carried that must be EXHAUSTED!"
NPC Perio The residents of $ENTITY sure send A LOT of letters. $ENTITY Not that I'm complaining. $ENTITY Job security, right?!
NPC Perio People sometimes think that all the letters are just magically delivered into their mailboxes. $ENTITY That's not how it works at all. $ENTITY I deliver each letter by hand, but I work so fast that nobody sees me drop the letters off. $ENTITY I'm like a postal ninja!
NPC Perio $ENTITY You know how there are two girls working at the post office, right? $ENTITY There's $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY , who works during the day, $ENTITY and $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY , who works at night. This might be a weird question, but $ENTITY who do you think is cuter? $ENTITY Pelly. Phyllis. Umm...
NPC Perio $ENTITY The rumor about me and $ENTITY Pelly... Not true at all. $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY is a really nice person and all, $ENTITY but I just can't stop thinking about $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY . There's just something about her, you know? $ENTITY But I guess I could see myself with $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY . I don't know. $ENTITY Anyway, thanks for listening.
NPC Perio $ENTITY You know what today is, don't you?!... It's WEDNESDAY! $ENTITY Today's the day I ask $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY out to dinner! $ENTITY I hope she says yes this time...
NPC Perio $ENTITY AHHHHHHHH! $ENTITY Guess what?... Phyllis $ENTITY blew me a kiss today! $ENTITY She put her hand up to her mouth and went... mwah $ENTITY -choo! $ENTITY Then she blew her nose into a tissue and someone said bless you. $ENTITY Hmm... Whatever. $ENTITY I know what I saw.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Friday already? $ENTITY That was quick. $ENTITY I like to kick back on Friday nights and just let my feathers hang loose. $ENTITY Makes me feel as free as a bird!... I wonder if $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY is free tonight.... She's a bird too, you know. $ENTITY It'd only make sense that she'd be up for it!
NPC Perio $ENTITY Pelly $ENTITY , huh? $ENTITY Sure,... Pelly $ENTITY is great if you want a girl who's nice, $ENTITY sweet, $ENTITY and girly... But if you want a girl who's $ENTITY feisty, $ENTITY moody, $ENTITY and abrasive,... Phyllis $ENTITY is absolutely better. She can be a bit... $ENTITY prickly... $ENTITY at times, $ENTITY but that's just the way she shows affection. $ENTITY I just love the way her bill wrinkles up in disgust every time she sees me. I know what she really means...
NPC Perio $ENTITY WHOA! $ENTITY Really? $ENTITY I thought I was the only one who understood $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY 's charm and sophistication! $ENTITY The cold, unfeeling eyes hidden under those long lashes... $ENTITY The tangy smell of her feathers when she's molting...... If only she were mine...
NPC Perio "Umm"? What do you mean, $ENTITY "Umm"?... You can't decide who's cuter? $ENTITY If you're not sure, why not vote for... Phyllis... She might come off as rude sometimes, but she's not rude. $ENTITY She's just misunderstood. I really wish everyone could see what I see in her.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Weather like this makes me want to stretch my wings and fly until the sun goes down! $ENTITY I better deliver these letters quickly before the weather turns.
NPC Perio $ENTITY I won't stop until $ENTITY every $ENTITY last $ENTITY letter $ENTITY is delivered to its intended recipient.... RAIN OR SHINE! $ENTITY But I'm really glad it's sunny today. $ENTITY 
NPC Perio Hmm. $ENTITY It's pretty gloomy out today. $ENTITY Seems like a good day to stay inside and write a letter! $ENTITY This message brought to you by the $ENTITY post office. $ENTITY 
NPC Perio Oh... uh... hey, ... I know I must really look like I just stepped out of the shower , but it's only because it's raining today. $ENTITY I hope I don't run into $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY in this sad, soggy condition...
NPC Perio $ENTITY Man, $ENTITY it's raining cats and dogs out here today!... Sorry. $ENTITY Is that rude? $ENTITY I don't want to upset any of our feline or canine residents.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Br... r! $ENTITY It's $ENTITY so $ENTITY cold... I can't feel my feathers!
NPC Perio $ENTITY This blizzard is intense, $ENTITY but I'll never give up! $ENTITY I'll never quit! $ENTITY Wherever mail sits undelivered... $ENTITY Wherever letters lie unread... $ENTITY That's where I'll be! Because I am a postman in the great city of ... and the mail $ENTITY MUST $ENTITY #x0; $ENTITY BE... DELIVERED! $ENTITY Man... $ENTITY I wish $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY was here to hear that.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Such beautiful and, $ENTITY uh, $ENTITY fragrant $ENTITY weather we're having today. $ENTITY It makes working so much $ENTITY more $ENTITY r ... g...
NPC Perio Hey! You have a letter from ... Oh, $ENTITY but it looks like you have too many letters already and can't receive this one. Why don't you clear out some of your old letters, and I'll stop by later to deliver this one. All right?
NPC Perio You have a letter from ... !
NPC Perio OK, looks like you're all set!... See you later!
NPC Perio $ENTITY So many letters! $ENTITY So little time!
NPC Perio $ENTITY Read any good letters lately?... Any with some juicy gossip? $ENTITY Sorry. $ENTITY None of my business.
NPC Perio I still have a lot of deliveries to make...
NPC Perio People say I talk too much while I'm out making deliveries. $ENTITY I disagree.
NPC Perio A lot of people ask me why I walk instead of fly when I deliver the mail. Well, $ENTITY flying is pretty exhausting when you're carrying a bag full of mail and packages. Also, there was this kid at my old job who used to knock me out of the sky with a slingshot. $ENTITY Kind of ruined flying for me.
NPC Perio $ENTITY Oh, ... Great timing! $ENTITY I have an express delivery for you from ... I'll just stick it in your mailbox, so make sure you check it ASAP! $ENTITY Catch you later!
NPC Perio $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY great timing, ... I have a bunch of letters addressed to you, but I can't deliver them because your mailbox is full! $ENTITY Please clear out some of your old letters so I can deliver the new ones!
NPC Perio $ENTITY Oh, $ENTITY great timing, ... I have a bunch of letters addressed to $ENTITY 's mailbox is full! $ENTITY Could you ask $ENTITY to clear out some old letters so I can deliver the new ones?
NPC Perio $ENTITY I'm counting on you!
NPC Perio Also, please ask the other players who have full mailboxes to clear them out. $ENTITY Thank you!
NPC Perio It would be a shame if a really important letter went undelivered because of a full mailbox. $ENTITY I'm counting on you!
NPC Perio Well, $ENTITY back to work!... See ya!
NPC Perio I'd love to stay and chat, maybe have a cup of tea. But $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY would be really upset. $ENTITY She has eyes everywhere... $ENTITY
