HA Ev HalloweenB Apparently, $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY 's in full swing outside! I might keep workin' out inside, though. $ENTITY Bu- $ENTITY but $ENTITY it's not 'cause I'm scared or anything, got it?!
HA Ev HalloweenB Apparently people will come to your house and scare you if you're there. $ENTITY Bring it on! $ENTITY I'm ready!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Scaring people and playing tricks on 'em... Halloween $ENTITY is a weird holiday. $ENTITY 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Think you've got $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY skills? $ENTITY Try to scare me!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Anyone who tries to scare me is gonna get bonked on the noggin. $ENTITY But I guess if anyone super scary comes by, I can always repel 'em with $ENTITY candy... 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Stay on guard all day today, $ENTITY ! Some folks are for sure gonna try to trick you! $ENTITY But it's a whole different ballgame if you've got $ENTITY candy $ENTITY on you!... 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I'm not afraid of ghosts! $ENTITY They're all wispy, and they have, like, zero muscle! No way they can get the best of me! $ENTITY 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY A monster wouldn't be a worthy opponent at all! $ENTITY Sure, it's got a scary face and it's kinda big. But it's pretty slow too! $ENTITY If one of those things showed up here, I'd just challenge it to a race! Loser goes home! $ENTITY !
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Huh? What would I do if a giant bug showed up here? $ENTITY Well... I'd catch it in a giant net, of course!
HA Ev HalloweenB Werewolves seem like they'd be pretty fast and strong! $ENTITY I imagine they're just like me... If they stop by looking for trouble, I think it will all come down to an epic thumb-wrestling match!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Huh? Me? Afraid of mummies? Not a chance. I'd be like... "Get this guy to a hospital! His bandages are falling off!"
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Yeah, skeletons don't scare me even one tiny bit! $ENTITY Think about it! How is something with no muscle whatsoever gonna beat ME at anything? $ENTITY 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Hey! I gave you your $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ! Now make like a lemming, and step off!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I gave you $ENTITY candy... 
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Get away! Shoo!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Ha ha! That costume doesn't scare me at all! $ENTITY I should play a trick on you just for trying to freak me out. $ENTITY But I'll give you a chance to get out of it! $ENTITY You and I are gonna play a game. If you win, I give you some $ENTITY candy... But if I win, I'm gonna trick you super hard! $ENTITY !
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Whaaaaa? $ENTITY I mean... whaaaat's up? $ENTITY Heh heh! $ENTITY You didn't scare me at all, ... You're here for $ENTITY candy $ENTITY , aren't you?... In that case, we should play a game for it! Beat me to win some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY !

HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY I'll give you $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ! Just go away!... Wait! You don't have any room in your pockets! $ENTITY You know, $ENTITY with its hands full really isn't all that scary after all... .
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY What?! $ENTITY Are you trying to pull a fast one? Suddenly, you're not so scary! $ENTITY You almost had me! How could I have been so wimpy, $ENTITY ?
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Heya! $ENTITY Happy Halloween! $ENTITY Candy, please! Let's chat!
HA Ev HalloweenB Yo, $ENTITY ! Happy Halloween! $ENTITY I want some candy! Let's talk!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY If you want some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY , you're gonna have to scare it out of me with the right mask!
HA Ev HalloweenB $ENTITY Looking like that is not gonna work! I mean, your face is scary, but it's not that scary, ... You've got to put on a super-scary mask, $ENTITY #x0;o $ENTITY #x0;a $ENTITY #x0;!
