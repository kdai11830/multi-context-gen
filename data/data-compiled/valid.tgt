Be mindful of all your turnips if you want success in the stalk market . ... Oh my , see ? I tend to go on and on once I get started talking about turnips . Old habits , I suppose .

$ENTITY Uh ... Is n't that kinda personal ?
$ENTITY Nothing ? ... OK , you 're fibbing , right ? $ENTITY Maaaaaan ! $ENTITY I just do n't know what to believe anymore !

Baking pies that make the most of the sweetness of $ENTITY fruits $ENTITY is a good idea more times than not . $ENTITY But I do recommend using honey ... taken from a $ENTITY beehive ... The flavor and natural sweetness of honey will add an extra kick to the pie , $ENTITY making it irresistible ! $ENTITY Also , $ENTITY if it 's honey from the flowers in ... it 'll make it a unique $ENTITY taste !
This Saturday is the big $ENTITY Bug-Off ... I usually prefer to just leave the bugs to their own business ... So I 'm not sure how I feel about the tournament rule that forces you to give all the bugs to $ENTITY Nat $ENTITY !
$ENTITY This is quite nice ! $ENTITY I think it might be perfect if the $ENTITY coffee beans $ENTITY were the kind I originally wanted .
$ENTITY

Dinosaur eggs vary in size depending on the species , but larger ones can reach about a foot in length . If the egg was fossilized when it was just about to hatch , sometimes intact bones can be found inside . However , it is generally rather difficult to determine the exact species a fossilized egg belongs to .
$ENTITY Today at ... , right ? $ENTITY That works for me ! $ENTITY Just ... do n't be mad $ENTITY if I 'm a little late , ... .
$ENTITY Do n't mind us . $ENTITY We 're just sharing ... !

$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY My package was delivered to $ENTITY by mistake ? ... Hmm . I suppose that makes ... no sense .
$ENTITY Today I think everyone should call me ... Hey , do n't look at me like I 'm weird ! $ENTITY It 's what my outfit 's called ! $ENTITY See ! $ENTITY My $ENTITY is totally $ENTITY -style , right ?

$ENTITY Hi there ! $ENTITY My name 's ... A while back , $ENTITY I met $ENTITY over in $ENTITY , and ... # x0 ; tried to persuade me to move here ...

$ENTITY Oh , nice ! Thanks !
$ENTITY You like this sort of thing , right ? I mean , who does n't ?
$ENTITY I bet you look good in pretty much anything , ... so you should keep this ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , here 's something that only the real $ENTITY would know ... $ENTITY My words to live by !
$ENTITY A nonspeaking part ? You mean , $ENTITY like , I 'd be someone in the background , $ENTITY like a juggler ? $ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY great idea ! If you guys mess up your lines , $ENTITY I can distract the crowd with my juggle-mania !
$ENTITY Let 's see ... I know ! $ENTITY Let 's play $ENTITY charades ... # x0 ;
... But you still lose . $ENTITY 'Cause your time already ran out ! $ENTITY Too bad , ... .
$ENTITY lives on his own , $ENTITY right , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Why does he need a couch with two seats then ? $ENTITY Maybe he 's hoping for someone to ask to be his roommate ... ? Hm . I wonder if I should ask him ...
'm sick . No guests currently admitted . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Did n't $ENTITY say she rehearses for plays and stuff at home ? $ENTITY I bet she uses her big bed as a pretend stage . $ENTITY Man , she 's super committed ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What 'd you say ? ! $ENTITY Huh ? What ? ... Sorry , $ENTITY but I ca n't hear what you 're saying !
$ENTITY You 're so fit , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY How do you stay so healthy when all I ever see you do is EAT ? !
$ENTITY Ah , never mind ! $ENTITY It 's the thought that counts , not the wrapping . $ENTITY Sorry you got dragged into all this ... . Thanks ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ha $ENTITY ha $ENTITY ha ! $ENTITY Finally , ya understand ! $ENTITY Oh ! ... Looks like we 've got company , $ENTITY so let 's table this talk for now .

$ENTITY Wh-what ... ? $ENTITY , you ca n't ... You 're making a huge mistake ... , tell her ! You ca n't avoid sleep and not be sleepy ! ...

$ENTITY Oh , ... Finally caught up with you ! $ENTITY Do you remember me ? ... It 's ...

$ENTITY Huh ... ... In the late-night $ENTITY rain . $ENTITY I get it ! $ENTITY You 're one of those go- against-the-grain types , are n't ya , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY I got so frustrated earlier that I wondered if sticking my head into the snow $ENTITY might help me cool off . $ENTITY At the very least , $ENTITY it would probably take my mind off things !
$ENTITY Thanks to the ordinance , I always recycle things I do n't need anymore . $ENTITY It 's kind to the earth AND to my wallet ... . What a wonderful idea !
$ENTITY I 'm ... I used to live here ! $ENTITY One of my favorite things to do is munch on a local $ENTITY while reading a good book . $ENTITY I 'll have to get some before I head home !
$ENTITY For a $ENTITY coconut tart $ENTITY , you really want to bring out the sweetness of the fresh ingredients . $ENTITY And for that you 'll want the honey from a $ENTITY beehive ... It brings out the fruit 's true sweetness ... and then intensifies it !
$ENTITY Something about this combination seems off balance . Some items are supposed to have real star power ... $ENTITY But your outfit is putting a spotlight on the items that should be playing second fiddle ! $ENTITY Do n't worry I 'm not giving up on you just yet . Focus on balance , and bring me back another outfit !
$ENTITY Haaa ... $ENTITY There ya go again with that goofy talk ! $ENTITY Listen to me , $ENTITY Sonny ... Ya need to learn how to $ENTITY build the proper relationships with people ! $ENTITY
... =
$ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY Spill the beans ... Beans are all right , $ENTITY I guess .

$ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY thanks for everything ! ... But be careful not to get jealous of my awesome style .
$ENTITY Oh , ... Haha ! This is a rare sight ! You 're actually doing some work ! $ENTITY I feel like I should probably take a picture to commemorate this , but I do n't have my camera on me ... Hey , if you have yours , you should take a picture ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I 'm surprised you knew I was even here ! ... But unfortunately for you , it looks like the time 's up , $ENTITY so you lose this game , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Is everything OK , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY said you needed to talk to me right away !
$ENTITY I see ... In that case , $ENTITY your hairstyle should reflect your strong inner core !
I do n't suppose you 've seen ... lately ... That bug is incredibly rare ! As a lover of rare things , I just ca n't pass up an opportunity to get one . $ENTITY I 'm begging you ... $ENTITY Will you catch $ENTITY for me ? $ENTITY OK ! Impossible !
$ENTITY Ohhhhh ... Wrong answer , $ENTITY # x0 ; o $ENTITY # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Wow ! ... Awesome ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe you caught one of these !
Well , I suppose I should thank you ! $ENTITY Hmmmm ... Oh ! $ENTITY I got it ! I have just the thing ! $ENTITY Here ! Take it !
$ENTITY Happy birthday , ... Today 's a great day , $ENTITY is n't it ? $ENTITY Some people do n't like the idea of getting older , $ENTITY but I think of it as gaining wisdom and experience ! $ENTITY I almost forgot ! $ENTITY Did you read the birthday card I sent ? ... I put a lot of effort into writing neatly for you . $ENTITY
Whoa , $ENTITY went a little crazy there , did ya ? ... One is more than enough , man !
$ENTITY They were amazing ! $ENTITY You used the perfect amount of butter .
$ENTITY Oh , I get it ! $ENTITY I bet it 's because your room 's a total mess now , yeah ?
$ENTITY It 's a $ENTITY picture $ENTITY of me ! $ENTITY Signed , $ENTITY of course ... . I hope you 'll put it in a place where you 'll see it every day . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY this has been quite an odd $ENTITY April Fools ' Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY But now all the mysteries are solved , $ENTITY thanks to you ! ... would be lost without you , ... !
$ENTITY Shh ! ... We 're supposed to keep quiet in here , ... .
$ENTITY I hope the $ENTITY means that $ENTITY is going to make us tea . $ENTITY Man , $ENTITY when $ENTITY has guests over , $ENTITY she really goes all out !
ENTITY Very good , very good ! $ENTITY The money makes everything official , and work on your house can begin at once . $ENTITY You can also choose the color of your newly built home 's roof . So what color $ENTITY will it be , hm ?
$ENTITY I guess $ENTITY must have liked it if $ENTITY # x0 ; changed right into it ! $ENTITY Good to hear !
Hey , $ENTITY , $ENTITY you know $ENTITY pretty well , $ENTITY do n't you ? $ENTITY We 're acquaintances , $ENTITY but I think we could be really good friends if we took the time to hang out . $ENTITY We should plan a fun activity together sometime . $ENTITY Like ... or something .
It 's ... It 's clean , so do n't worry about that , ... .
$ENTITY Too bad ! $ENTITY So sad ! $ENTITY Not that I would n't eat that , of course . $ENTITY Here 's your last chance ! $ENTITY Hint number 3 ! $ENTITY The fruit I want to eat has $ENTITY a big seed in the middle ...

$ENTITY Here $ENTITY my way of saying thanks !
$ENTITY Wrong ! $ENTITY And that means ... Awesome ! $ENTITY I won ! $ENTITY
I 'd actually decided the price for the last item in advance . $ENTITY No hard feelings , yeah , ... ? $ENTITY But while we were playing ... you seemed cool with every choice .
ENTITY Thanks much for paying your home loan in full ! Very good , yes , yes ! $ENTITY I always had faith that you would fulfill the terms of our little agreement , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Now then ... does your home not seem $ENTITY a teensy bit on the wee side ? $ENTITY Yes , yes , I have to say $ENTITY I do feel a slightly larger home would suit you much better , hm ? $ENTITY More room for furniture delights ! $ENTITY And for gratuitous swinging of elbows too . If you 're interested , please let me know at any time , hm ?
$ENTITY likes plants , so I 'm not surprised to see she 's raising ... .
$ENTITY Whodunit ? $ENTITY No really , $ENTITY who put you up to dressing in such a ridiculous costume ?
$ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY and $ENTITY Harriet ... We just had to share with them ! Everyone who got one was happy and satisfied !
How do I look compared to yesterday ? Do I look any cooler ? $ENTITY I guess I ca n't expect to change much in just one day ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Whaa- ? ! $ENTITY Did you forget ? ! $ENTITY You asked me to teach you how to fish today ! $ENTITY I waited , but you never came over , $ENTITY so I called you here , ... !

$ENTITY ! $ENTITY # x0 ;
ENTITY Oh , that 's right . Did you notice that big sewing machine over there ? $ENTITY I 've been using this machine of mine for quite a while now , so it acts up from time to time ... . $ENTITY My sisters just could n't stand it anymore , so they got me that nice , new one as a present .
$ENTITY Ha ha ! $ENTITY You actually made it back ! $ENTITY Thanks for the effort , ...

$ENTITY There you are , $ENTITY ! I 'm always so happy to see you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , man ... I should n't have encouraged her , ...

$ENTITY It 's a little weird reading that all this time later , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I knew you would understand how gorgeous these are , ... So ... which piece of furniture caught your attention ? ... Just let me know !

$ENTITY Thank you ! $ENTITY Thank $ENTITY you ! ... Dr. Shrunk is in the house ! $ENTITY My $ENTITY Resignation Joke $ENTITY is just the thing to CURE what ails you ! $ENTITY The other day ...

Well , ... you know what I said to him ? ... `` Could I just get fries with that ? '' $ENTITY
$ENTITY Thanks a bunch for the present , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's too soon for you to feel totally relieved , ... There 's one more person for you to seek !
$ENTITY If I lived in a town like this , $ENTITY I 'd make the most out of each and every day . $ENTITY There are so many things to do ! $ENTITY Then move here ! It 's pretty boring .
$ENTITY are both scared of the same thing ! $ENTITY What ? $ENTITY You do n't think that 's useful ? ... Well , $ENTITY do n't come crying to me when you get pranked ... or worse !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY So , ... did you know the best way to cook a $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pie is with some honey ? $ENTITY It makes me wonder whether it then becomes too sweet or not ... Well , perhaps the honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY just brings out the true $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY flavors !
$ENTITY My ... I was so sure I 'd permanently lost it that I bought another one . $ENTITY Oh well . $ENTITY If you like it , $ENTITY please take it ! $ENTITY OK , thanks ! That 's all right ...

$ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle ... I was n't that excited ! I was merely caught off guard . That 's all it was ! $ENTITY And anyway ... My excitement was rendered ineffectual since you monopolized his time , Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY actually , $ENTITY since you 're here , I can just pay you directly .
$ENTITY So here we are , $ENTITY right in middle of the day , $ENTITY right , ... Well , not today , if you think about it . $ENTITY The $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY stretches the daylight way longer today than ever . $ENTITY Like taffy . $ENTITY Or gum . $ENTITY Could get sticky .
ENTITY Still , ... you have yet to see all the surprises I can muster !
$ENTITY I hope you 're happy with your purchase . $ENTITY You did get quite a bargain ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Are you really gon na abandon me right when I need you the most ?
$ENTITY Hm ... Well , $ENTITY now that I know you feel that way , $ENTITY maybe I wo n't move after all , $ENTITY . $ENTITY That 'll give us way more time to hang out together here in ... !
$ENTITY and I 'm pretty sure you should n't be the `` nothing. '' ... But I guess that 's fine ... . As long as I 'm the `` sweet '' !
... Thanks for making the delivery ! $ENTITY You 're OK , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY how did you know I was hiding here , ... ?
$ENTITY Bleh , the flavor nearly choked me , and the lasting bitterness is just as horrible ... So it should work !
Hmm . This is n't nearly as fruity of a thing as I wanted . Sorry , but I just ca n't take this , OK ?
$ENTITY # xB ;
... . I ... I feel a little bit better now ... .
$ENTITY Has $ENTITY already opened presents ? $ENTITY # x6 ; $ENTITY If it were my party , $ENTITY I 'd be anxious to see what everyone brought me .
I 'll figure out where to put it later ... . I 'm kinda picky about how I arrange my place , $ENTITY so I wan na take my time !
I like $ENTITY a lot of milk $ENTITY in my coffee ... . It tastes really delicious , $ENTITY like coffee-flavored milk , ... .

$ENTITY The awards ceremony was super exciting ! ... Next time $ENTITY I 'm gon na do even better , ... .
$ENTITY Do n't take it personally . $ENTITY This is what $ENTITY 's all about !
ENTITY You 'd like to know about the data provided from this town to other HHA members , is that right ?
That 's incorrect , ... I thought you 'd be able to understand me , but ... Too bad ... . was the correct answer !
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY what time 's good for you ? $ENTITY I can rendezvous anytime after ... .
$ENTITY You may be tempted to buy more than you need ! $ENTITY Be careful to keep your impulse buying in check today ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I 'll take ... Whoa ! ... That was close ! $ENTITY Too close ! $ENTITY I almost lost control ...
$ENTITY My favorite part of the tournament is finding out the results ! $ENTITY The suspense is , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY totally killing me !
Would you mind taking this off my hands ? $ENTITY You can have it for free , $ENTITY of course ! $ENTITY Sure ! No , thanks !
A legend states that a bunny is pounding mochi in a bowl way up on the moon ... But to me , $ENTITY it kinda looks like the profile of a woman , ... says it looks like a crab ... Perhaps we 're just seeing what we want most from life when we look at the moon ? $ENTITY So why a crab ... ?
What you ca n't see ca n't hurt you . ''
$ENTITY You 've got that darling outfit on again today . $ENTITY I know you wore it earlier $ENTITY because it left quite an impression on me , ... .
$ENTITY The moon is very beautiful tonight , $ENTITY but I must admit I find myself more enchanted by the tasty songpyeon .
If you do n't have anything else to do , why not check out the museum ? ... I think they 're open !
$ENTITY Oh , long time no see ! $ENTITY Have you grown a little taller since I last saw you ? ... That 's ridiculous , right ? $ENTITY Maybe it 's actually me $ENTITY who shrank !
$ENTITY The place I 'm headed has a sorta famous symbol of something cool called a merlion ! $ENTITY Ever seen one ? It has the head of a lion but the body of a fish . $ENTITY It 's actually a very mysterious creature . $ENTITY Hey , did you know I have the head of a seagull and the body of a seagull too ? ... That 's where you 're supposed to laugh ! $ENTITY Do n't leave me hanging ! Gah ! $ENTITY OK , ... your humor is as prickly and hard as a durian , ... which so happens to be the national fruit of this place . Anyway , what do you think ? $ENTITY Have an idea where I was headed ?
$ENTITY That was a good purchase , $ENTITY .
Do n't worry $ENTITY you 'll have more chances to win this tournament . $ENTITY All it takes is a little hard work . $ENTITY Or natural talent . $ENTITY Either one , $ENTITY really .
$ENTITY Tonight 's the $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY festival ! $ENTITY We all watch the moon and eat lots of delicious food ! $ENTITY And then we all run to the mooooon ! $ENTITY Well , that `` run to the moon '' part is really just a wish of mine . $ENTITY Ha ha !

$ENTITY Whoa ! ... What in the world happened to your gorgeous face , $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY That does NOT look good ! If you have any medicine , $ENTITY I think now is the time to use it . $ENTITY Uh ... get better soon , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Shopping is all about timing ! $ENTITY Even if something 's expensive , ... when you want it , $ENTITY you just got ta go for it !
$ENTITY Thanks ! $ENTITY I 'll be waiting !
$ENTITY Ohhhhh ... No need to say anything . $ENTITY I understand .
So tell me , ... , $ENTITY what kind of clothes do you wear when you 're relaxing at home ? ... Whatever 's comfy . I keep it stylish .

$ENTITY Ever seen a sea horse ? You might think they 'd be fun to ride , but , maaan , they do n't feel the same . $ENTITY
ENTITY Well , you already own a house , and according to a recent survey , your approval rating is $ENTITY percent $ENTITY . $ENTITY So all you need to do now is gain the approval of the citizens ! $ENTITY Hm . Let me think of a good way for you to gain their approval ...

& # x1F ; $ENTITY
$ENTITY Yar and yo ho ! $ENTITY Since ye made it this far , ... it only be customary that ye shush an ' a-listen till the very end ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Do you really think so ? ... I have to admit $ENTITY the thought of owning this is exciting . OK. $ENTITY Consider it sold !
$ENTITY I know everyone says this , $ENTITY but I really love getting presents . $ENTITY Any presents , really .
$ENTITY Did you need me for something ?
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY I did NOT just say that ! Did I ? $ENTITY What came over me ?
$ENTITY Well , I think that about wraps things up for me , ... make sure $ENTITY pays you for your trouble !
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Way to make it here , guys .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Wow ! You look kind of like Santa ! I bet $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY would be impressed ... if he ever gets his presents delivered .
I 'm pretty surprised that $ENTITY owns ... I bet he bought it by mistake .
$ENTITY Lately I 've been thinking the walls of my home need a little pizzazz , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Yeah , wallpaper just is n't enough . $ENTITY Will you find me something to put up ? $ENTITY A shelf , $ENTITY a lighting fixture , $ENTITY or something like that ?
$ENTITY A huh huh huh ! $ENTITY It 's like someone launched a giant water balloon at $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY What ? It 's fun to mess with someone who does n't want to know about a sports score . $ENTITY But if you do n't care , it takes all the fun out of it , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Whoa ! ... What a coincidence meeting you ... $ENTITY in a place like this , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Do n't you think $ENTITY is one of the prettiest towns you 've ever visited ? $ENTITY It 's probably thanks to the $ENTITY Keep $ENTITY Beautiful ... ordinance our mayor enacted . $ENTITY I 've even been cleaning my room since it went into effect .
$ENTITY I 've prepared some $ENTITY ogre masks $ENTITY for everyone to play with , $ENTITY so you should take one too , ... ! $ENTITY Would you like a red one $ENTITY or a blue one ? $ENTITY Red one ! Blue one !

The $ENTITY Early Bird $ENTITY ordinance in this town ... The negative aspect is that we 're all a bit sleepy in the morning , $ENTITY but ... the plus side is that our day feels a lot longer this way ! $ENTITY Strangely enough , ... this might just prolong our lives , ... !
$ENTITY I bet I could eat potatoes all day every day , $ENTITY !
this place , I can see the signs . Oh yes , I can ... . I see disasters and broken hearts ... .
$ENTITY Fruit $ENTITY pies $ENTITY are the kings of all desserts . $ENTITY If you want to bring out the sweetness of the $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY more , $ENTITY you can add some honey . You can get honey $ENTITY from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY , $ENTITY and it 's so worth it 'cause fruit and honey are amazing .
There is no room for two dragons in one pond . ''
$ENTITY I guess you never know until you try it on !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY If we 're talking fish and other such splishy-splashy things , I guess I 'd go $ENTITY with the tuna . Maybe a carp . $ENTITY No , not for eating ! $ENTITY I 'm talking about which one I 'd want to turn into if I ever had the chance ! Man , $ENTITY why d'you have to take it to such a dark place ?
$ENTITY Heh heh heh ... I see you like keeping me in suspense , ... !
No sweater off my back . ''
$ENTITY It 's not as convenient as using a computer or phone , $ENTITY but sending an old-fashioned letter is really fun ! $ENTITY Especially here in ... because people will actually write you back . $ENTITY Just write down a quick hello , $ENTITY or a love note , $ENTITY or whatever , $ENTITY and trusty $ENTITY Pete $ENTITY will make sure it 's delivered . $ENTITY In a weird way , $ENTITY he 's like the town matchmaker ...
$ENTITY You ever get a look at $ENTITY 's house ? $ENTITY There so much space ! $ENTITY Man , it 'd be nice to have all that extra space ... . $ENTITY .

$ENTITY I see , so you live over there , huh ? ... I 'm glad you found a nice place !
$ENTITY What is this ? $ENTITY Is it , like , $ENTITY abstract art or something ? $ENTITY No , wait ... Now that I look a little more closely , $ENTITY I can see this is clearly trash . $ENTITY Come on ! $ENTITY I mean , this is funny and all , $ENTITY but quit with the jokes ! ... My birthday is serious business !
$ENTITY Hi , ... The sound of the rain makes the night even more relaxing , $ENTITY do n't you think , ... ?
ENTITY Are you ready ? $ENTITY I 'm going to explain it in one go . $ENTITY Listen real carefully , OK ? The first thing you got ta understand is that these turnips are , of course , edible ... But it 's a fact no one here actually buys these things for eating ... No , that 'd just be silly . $ENTITY Everyone uses these turnips to make a profit in the stalk market . $ENTITY Hmmm . What else ... Right . You know about $ENTITY Re-Tail ... You can sell your turnips there . The price of turnips will go up and down every day . Very fickle . $ENTITY So selling them when the price is higher than what you bought them for ? $ENTITY That gives you a profit . $ENTITY On the other hand , $ENTITY selling them when the price is lower $ENTITY will net you a loss . Very tricky sometimes .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY How long will this last , anyway ? ... I 'm gon na punch this rain right in the knee ! ... !
...
$ENTITY Wow ! ... It feels like a freezer out here ! Good thing I do n't mind the chill .
Hey , $ENTITY , did you know ? $ENTITY That train you see traveling from town to town is fourth generation ... .

It inherited the DNA from the first generation , but ... It 's the first one that 's had a major change in design , ... The current one has various styles , such as limited and rapid designs ... I think the rapid LS012-series with that white line on the cobalt blue $ENTITY looks sharp ! It 's my favorite ! $ENTITY Are you lost yet ? Should I start from the beginning ? ... I sort of geek out on trains . $ENTITY It 's my secret thing .
$ENTITY See , ... is here for me as well , ... . $ENTITY # x4 ; ... # x0 ; even brought me a present ... # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; sure a nice person ! $ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY by any chance , $ENTITY bring me a present as well ? $ENTITY This is for you ! I 'm sorry .
$ENTITY Now . Theme challenges . They 're about expression . You ? Capture a theme . My crew ? Grades your work . $ENTITY But wait ! Interior and exterior . Not just one or the other ! Every room . All graded . Except the basement . $ENTITY And just to preempt your bustin ' of my chops : Exterior parts ? Worth more . Fewer parts , more points . $ENTITY So . Yeah . Exterior parts . Good way to get started . Kick that theme off right ! Bang !
$ENTITY Oh , ... You would n't happen to know where $ENTITY is , $ENTITY would you ? $ENTITY I have to talk to ... # x0 ; $ENTITY about something ... .

$ENTITY After going for a jog , I come to the convenience store to cool down before heading back home !
$ENTITY Did you talk to that happy , bouncy bunny guy that 's just hangin ' around the event plaza ? $ENTITY When spring rolls around , $ENTITY he always $ENTITY comes dancing in like that ... I do n't know if I trust him , $ENTITY what with all that wide-eyed smilin ' he 's doin ' ... $ENTITY But he seems harmless .
$ENTITY you just got 1 rose ... That will come to $ENTITY Bells ... Sorry about that , ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Wait . You thought I lost something , but now you 've got nothing to show me , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Then you 'll never know if it 's really mine , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Thanks for accepting my gift , ... I just hate to throw things away ... . !
$ENTITY Really ? ! $ENTITY You think I should move here ? ! ... Um ... Sorry ! $ENTITY That 's cool you 'd invite me , but $ENTITY I 'm gon na pass , ... I just feel like $ENTITY my current town has the tastiest water ... . A huh huh ! $ENTITY I always end up just chugging it .
$ENTITY Ple ... ase stop teasing me . Just take this $ENTITY and leave me alone !
$ENTITY They 're $ENTITY ladder shades ... They might make catching bugs simpler so that you do n't have to squint in the sun ! Plus , $ENTITY I think you 'd look very $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY # x0 ; e $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY e in them !
$ENTITY Yeah , this stuff is WAY too advanced ! $ENTITY 'Specially for you ! $ENTITY You still think a cell phone ... is that stuff $ENTITY you wrap sandwiches up in ! $ENTITY It 's ridiculous ! Ridiculous , I say !
$ENTITY I 'm glad you 're here ! Have fun , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY HA HA HA ! $ENTITY You still saying that ? ... It 's called half-body bathing ! $ENTITY People do it to heat up by standing in lukewarm water up to their hips for a while , right ? $ENTITY I hear it 's actually really good for your body ...

$ENTITY
By any chance , ... did you leave that one town , ... Um , what was its name again ... ? $ENTITY Man , I 've totally forgotten . $ENTITY But ... one thing 's for sure ! ... I 'll never forget the days we spent together !
$ENTITY But ... that 's OK ! $ENTITY I 'm gon na wear it for a while just to see if I can get used to it .
$ENTITY Every item that comes through here always has such special memories attached to it . $ENTITY If you think like that ... do n't you feel like even the simplest item holds a special meaning ?
$ENTITY Hello again $ENTITY . Always nice to see you , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY The moon tonight is so pretty ! $ENTITY It 's almost as if it 's saying , `` Welcome to $ENTITY ! ''

$ENTITY Oh ! ... Did I not give you your $ENTITY dango $ENTITY rice cake yet ? $ENTITY Here you go then !
$ENTITY I thought he had totally forgotten about it , $ENTITY but I guess I was wrong !
$ENTITY Besides , $ENTITY if something like that happened ... .I know $ENTITY 's favorite saying . $ENTITY It 's ...
$ENTITY DJ KK $ENTITY is really amazing ! His selection of songs is just too perfect ! $ENTITY !
Earlier $ENTITY I found a book $ENTITY called $ENTITY on the $ENTITY . $ENTITY is aiming for with his life ...

$ENTITY If you want , please take my $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You have exquisite taste , darling ! $ENTITY How much ? I 'm just browsing ...
$ENTITY I see ! $ENTITY Feels like you might be bustin ' ol ' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY 's chops just a bit . $ENTITY But , please . Decorate as you see fit !
I do own a pocket guide to fashion , $ENTITY but I always have too much in my pockets to carry it .
$ENTITY Wooooo ! $ENTITY Yeaaah ! $ENTITY The sun keeps fueling my nonstop dance party ! ... No ! I 'm not sleepy ! ! ! Not sleeeeepy !
You came all the way to $ENTITY early in the morning in the pouring rain to see me , ... ?
$ENTITY Yes , perfect timing ! ... would you like to weigh in ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ugh ... Hurry ... .
$ENTITY I 'm not sure if anything 's changed since the last time you were over , $ENTITY so just make yourself at home .
$ENTITY I think $ENTITY clothes are the best ! $ENTITY They make me look and feel very respectable .
ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You brought me another egg ? $ENTITY Well , since you went to the trouble of finding it , you should open it ! Go ahead . Pop it in your mouth !

$ENTITY OK ! ... Shall we get going then ?
$ENTITY
$ENTITY
It 's full of snacks ...
$ENTITY I took a bite of this egg I found earlier ... but there was n't any yolk inside ! $ENTITY I found a surprise instead ! $ENTITY I guess $ENTITY I 'm just one of the lucky ones , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY This might sound like I 'm cheap , $ENTITY but I 'm sort of broke myself , so I ca n't sell it for less than that ... . $ENTITY Maybe next time ! ... !
$ENTITY I 'm gon na make big things happen this year , starting with my biceps ! $ENTITY Oh yeah , baby ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Noooo ! $ENTITY You picked $ENTITY Bells ! $ENTITY You totally must 've sensed $ENTITY that was the wallet-busting card ! $ENTITY But a deal 's a deal , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Here 's your ... Bells $ENTITY , as promised .
$ENTITY Listen up , ... When you see someone 's chair , $ENTITY you can somehow guess that person 's taste in things . $ENTITY 's house ... It 's $ENTITY , huh ? $ENTITY See ? $ENTITY Now ca n't you just picture her entire decorating style ? $ENTITY My methods never lie , ... !
$ENTITY Heh heh . Well . When the girls were younger ? Did n't care to hear that . Did n't want to look like the ol ' man ! ... Said they wanted to look like little thems . Not little mes . Guess ol ' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY can understand that ... But now ? We all look back on those days and laugh . Laugh out loud . Laugh together ! Good times . Boom . $ENTITY
... # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; probably shut in ... house today , but ... Well , have you met $ENTITY yet ? $ENTITY Yeah ! Not yet .
We only allow catch and release here on the island , $ENTITY so you ca n't take any of the fish home with you . The island 's ecosystem is a sensitive thing , you know .
$ENTITY ! $ENTITY Yes , $ENTITY I 'm snooping around $ENTITY 's place . $ENTITY Wait . $ENTITY What are YOU doing here ?
Guess you do n't know how something looks until you try it on . $ENTITY But I think I 'll take this off now .
... I do n't need any more help today ... But thanks . Coo ...
$ENTITY I $ENTITY do n't feel like talking to you right now !
& # xF ; $ENTITY
$ENTITY I heard you needed something from me right away . $ENTITY What is it ?
OK , ... Now plant the sapling by hand by pressing . Put your heart in it !
$ENTITY What ? You have n't delivered that package to $ENTITY Sorry to be so impatient , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY I 'm crushing it with my outfit today ! ... This is what those fashion smarties call the `` $ENTITY `` style !
Understood ... I 'm sure my coffee $ENTITY will satisfy customers with refined tastes ...
$ENTITY Heya ! ... Yep ! $ENTITY The sun 's still up ! ... Summer Solstice $ENTITY is crazy ! $ENTITY Guess I 'm gon na be awake all night , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Lately I 've been working on an idea for a lift-and-set workout . $ENTITY Basically , I want something I can lift and set , over and over , on top of my $ENTITY . $ENTITY Let me know if you come up with anything that would be good for that ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY Birthday cake ? ! ... I ca n't accept this ! ... Take it home with you , ... .
$ENTITY I can stand to be in nice shops like this for only so long ! What if I splurge for fashion I ca n't afford ?
$ENTITY You 're pretty popular , are n't you , ... I know ! ... You can help me collect signatures for my petition , $ENTITY ! I especially need signatures from people in other towns . $ENTITY Can you help me collect 'em by the end of today ? $ENTITY OK ! Ca n't today .
$ENTITY All right , I 'll be sure to give this a good home , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I always get really excited after finding something super cool !
ENTITY `` Well , they 're certainly giving it their all ! The difficult challenge is the reason town building is so worth it ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY But if you went out on a ledge just a $ENTITY LITTLE , $ENTITY you 'd grab the attention of everyone in town . $ENTITY You 'd be , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY totally popular , $ENTITY ! I just know it !
, what in the deep blue ... Do me peepers peep our new $ENTITY mayor ? Name o ' $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Yar har HAR ! $ENTITY Ol ' $ENTITY Tortimer $ENTITY left a whale of a job to a wee minnow ... Nar , do n't pay me no mind !

$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY this is ... an autographed ... Gosh , $ENTITY who in the world would lose it ? $ENTITY Certainly not me ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe someone just threw it away like that ! $ENTITY Oh , ... Do n't you want this instead , though ? $ENTITY Hee ! $ENTITY Well , looks like I 'll just take it off your hands then !
$ENTITY They 're $ENTITY ladder shades ... It might be fun to wear these while catching bugs today ! $ENTITY It 's like your eyes are camouflaged !
$ENTITY Having flowers like my $ENTITY around is good for the soul , ... .
... Well , $ENTITY I 'll do everything in my power to make that happen !
$ENTITY Oh no ! ... it looks like you spilled something on your shirt !
$ENTITY Yo , $ENTITY You need something from me or something ? ... ?
$ENTITY Really ? $ENTITY T- $ENTITY too expensive , huh ? ... Well , how about $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY then ? $ENTITY We got a deal ! I really do n't need it .
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY decided to have $ENTITY here ... I guess that makes sense . He 'd need to know how well his training regimen is going .
$ENTITY You 're back ! $ENTITY Nice timing . $ENTITY
$ENTITY When you put dynamic pieces together , they 'll just cancel each other out . What 's the point in that ? $ENTITY So if you must mix moods , $ENTITY you have to find a way to let each individual item tell its own story , $ENTITY honey !
Half a loaf is better than none . ''
Aw , $ENTITY I wonder when I 'll get good at fishing ... Of course , $ENTITY just hanging around outside is pretty fun too .
$ENTITY Oh , wow . $ENTITY You 're the best . $ENTITY Thanks !
$ENTITY , mummy costumes are one of my biggest $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY pet peeves . I mean , $ENTITY really ... . If I ca n't distinguish between your costume and a guy in traction , $ENTITY that 's not good .
ENTITY Avast ! $ENTITY Ye do n't got the $ENTITY 1,000 Bells ... It 's quite a bar $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY gain , $ENTITY if ye ask me !
$ENTITY According to the people who run the museum , they 're gon na bring in even more interesting pieces ! $ENTITY There 's a good number now , but I guess if you come back later there might be more ! $ENTITY !
... Yeah , that 's pretty good ! $ENTITY All right , starting today that 's my new catchphrase , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 'm very sorry , ... but that 's just too crucial to my home dcor , ... .
$ENTITY By the way , you can find equipment over at $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY 's store , $ENTITY Super T & amp ; T $ENTITY , on Main Street .
$ENTITY is a friend of yours , right ? Yeah , I thought so . $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; got this sorta $ENTITY vibe about ... # x0 ; $ENTITY , so my interest is piqued . But we 're not that close . $ENTITY This is just between you and me , but I really wish $ENTITY # x0 ; 'd $ENTITY # x0 ; go out of $ENTITY # x0 ; ... way to talk to me more ... . $ENTITY I suppose these things just take time , ... !
$ENTITY No way ! Sometimes I like to talk about yummy things to drink too . $ENTITY Like $ENTITY
$ENTITY Huh ? ... What are you doing here in the middle of the night ... ? $ENTITY Oh ! Hey , it 's ... But it 's so dark , $ENTITY I ca n't tell if it 's day or night ! $ENTITY GAHAHA ! ... !
$ENTITY # xE ; I 'm really sorry , ... A while ago I borrowed something from you $ENTITY and only just now remembered ...
I wish I could have said something while I was being made ... A simple `` too big '' or `` too small '' might have made all the difference . $ENTITY But , alas ! I just could n't make myself speak until my head was on my body .
& # x1F ; $ENTITY
$ENTITY Not sure what to make for dessert ? ... A tart is always a great choice . $ENTITY And there are so many types ! One of my favorites is $ENTITY banana tart ... # x2 ; banana tart $ENTITY recipe is honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY . $ENTITY Keep that to yourself , $ENTITY OK ?
It 's a little brisk , but $ENTITY the cold air just wakes you up ! $ENTITY Would you like to join me , $ENTITY ? If we sit close together , we 'll be nice and toasty !
You have n't created any ordinances in this town , have you ? $ENTITY Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not hinting that I want a whole bunch of rules or anything ! Like , $ENTITY a limit on the amount of snacks you could buy would be really bad , ... .
I got the $ENTITY & # x1F ; $ENTITY badge ! This shows I 'm a fan of diving !
$ENTITY One thing I love about the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY is the amazing smells that still waft through town hours later !
$ENTITY Geez ! Next time some crazy person shows up on $ENTITY April Fools ' Day ... I sure hope you 'll pick the right one !
$ENTITY Hey , you 're $ENTITY , right ? I 've been hearing a lot about you . $ENTITY Only good stuff , $ENTITY I promise ! $ENTITY I 'm $ENTITY . I hope you 'll come over to my place all the time . $ENTITY It 's not a party without YOU , I 've heard !

$ENTITY Whoa ! ... Wh- $ENTITY what 's up ? $ENTITY Did I say something in my sleep ? $ENTITY Just forget about it , OK ? $ENTITY Or my dream wo n't come true !

you sure you want to sit down ? You still have items in your pockets ! $ENTITY Since someone requested to go on a tour , if you sit down now ... $ENTITY all the items you 're carrying will be traded in for Bells and the funds will be deposited into your account . This applies to anything you own that you may be holding as well . $ENTITY Items you want to keep should be placed in the $ENTITY Item Drop Box ... Understood . Gim me a sec .
$ENTITY I 'm carrying around my fishing rod $ENTITY so I can catch fish , ... Why else would I have one ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Did you see the starry sky ? ... It 's so beautiful ! $ENTITY There are so , $ENTITY so many shooting stars . $ENTITY I think there 's enough for everyone in town to have a wish come true !
$ENTITY Well , how do I know if it 's mine if I do n't get to see it ? $ENTITY !

$ENTITY If you 're going to make fish , sear it good ! The tang of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY is essential . Essential , $ENTITY # x0 ; o $ENTITY # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; ! $ENTITY But I 'm never sure which one to use in particular situations ... That 's where your kitchen-intuition muscles are tested , $ENTITY . I call that `` inkuitchen . ''

The pachycephalosaurus is known for its round , helmetlike head , the use of which is still debated . The bony dome atop its skull was nearly a foot thick , which is why mostly skull fossils survive . Some theories say the animals would smash their heads together to determine pecking order .
$ENTITY Another year , another deeeelish $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! But gim me a few hoursI bet I 'll be hungry again .

I see . $ENTITY Regardless , $ENTITY I really want to ask for your help with this , $ENTITY . Mayor . $ENTITY After all , $ENTITY I think this would go a lot quicker $ENTITY if people were asked by someone familiar to them like you . It 'd be weird if a stranger like me just started going up and saying , `` HEY ! Want a CLUB ? ! ''
$ENTITY Heh heh heh . $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY actually chose all her own furniture . Who 'd pass up that opportunity ?
$ENTITY I 'll be sure to ask you for help again . You were so reliable , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Booooo ! $ENTITY Why ca n't the next Animal Intersection game come out sooner ?
Do you want to take a break too ? $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Today 's $ENTITY Festivale ... and I 'm gon na get started on the dancing early !
$ENTITY Since you came all this way , $ENTITY I hope you enjoy both of the events going on in $ENTITY today !
$ENTITY The second I saw your outfit , I was all , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY `` I have $ENTITY GOT to get myself an outfit just like that ! ''
$ENTITY I get really excited for rainy days ! $ENTITY Even this bean brew tastes extra special today ... Yar , ai n't that right , ... Brewster $ENTITY ?
Well , if that 's what you think , $ENTITY I guess I 'll take it off .
$ENTITY We 're celebrating all night long tonight . $ENTITY Are you sleepy yet ? ... I 'm getting a little sleepy ... Yaaaaawn ... . But since this is a special occasion and all , $ENTITY I 'm going to power through it !
$ENTITY Oh , ... You 're here early ! ... I 'm pretty OK with that , though ...
$ENTITY I saw $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY not too long ago , ... But he was n't handing out any presents or anything ... I wonder if something happened . $ENTITY I really hope everything 's all right !
$ENTITY If you 're troubled about what to do , $ENTITY seeing that you just moved here , $ENTITY I could give you some advice ! $ENTITY OK , let me hear it ! Nah , I 'm fine .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Hello , hello ... Snowy nights are totally the best . Yeah , it 's cold , but it 's worth it !
$ENTITY Hmmmm ... We 'd have to tear down a public works project , but if that 's OK , I think we can build here , yes .
You caught ... It 's worth ... $ENTITY Bells ! $ENTITY Doing well ! Now release it , and move on to the next one !
$ENTITY Nope , $ENTITY that 's not mine .
$ENTITY Yo ... You seem completely unfazed by the cold . I 'm jealous , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's finally $ENTITY Toy Day ... I 've had so much fun anticipating today ... I hope it lives up to my impossibly high expectations !
You know , you like to change your mind an awful lot ...

$ENTITY
$ENTITY How 's it feel ta be the only lass here , ...
What do you think is written on our $ENTITY nobody has been able to decipher it yet . $ENTITY However , there 's no denying it has historical value , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY of course ! $ENTITY I mean , maybe if it 's in a small group at a friend 's place ... but not in public ! $ENTITY If you wan na do it , I wo n't stop ya . $ENTITY Just do n't ask me to sing in front of everybody !
$ENTITY I see . $ENTITY So this is $ENTITY 's room ! $ENTITY Yeah , it 's got a nice vibe to it !
$ENTITY Hi , ... Taking a walk before bed to clear your mind , ... ?
$ENTITY All right ! Let me explain the rules . $ENTITY I have 5 pieces of furniture here . $ENTITY You 'll have to buy 1 of them . $ENTITY I 'll tell you what each item is and say its price in sequence . $ENTITY When you get that $ENTITY `` this is the one '' feeling , let me know ! $ENTITY If you ca n't decide until the last item , $ENTITY you have to take that one even if you do n't really want it ! $ENTITY That last piece of furniture could be a real bargain or a total rip-off ... It 'll depend on your luck ! $ENTITY OK ! So here we go ! How about this nice $ENTITY for ... Bells ... That 's the one ! I do n't want it .
Now with a butterfly fish , $ENTITY you want to salt and then grill that guy right up ... . I 'm not that picky , of course , $ENTITY so I 'm just gon na scarf it raw ! ... YUM !
$ENTITY I see . $ENTITY You 're not happy with that ... Fine ! $ENTITY I spent a TON of carbs coming up with that name ! Prepare to taste my brain 's wrath ! $ENTITY Uh ... $ENTITY One of these days , $ENTITY !
Have you seen Mayor $ENTITY 's $ENTITY house yet ? ... It 's a pretty boring place to live , ya know ?
$ENTITY Oh , hey ! Are you from around here ? ... , huh ? $ENTITY Happy to meet you , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I 'm ... I 'm from a tiny little country town called ... Actually it 's pretty much like here ! $ENTITY All surrounded by nature and stuff ! ...
$ENTITY And do n't worry . $ENTITY I probably wo n't come by later asking you to pay for it ! $ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey , ... You better have a good reason to call me over here !
ENTITY It is done ! $ENTITY Done like the past ! $ENTITY Tomorrow is here ! $ENTITY The future needs not this , so you must take it .
... =
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh , ... That 's a relief ... Had n't seen you in a bit , so I thought maybe you got mixed up in something shady ! $ENTITY Good to see you 're OK ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Whoa , easy now , ... Deep breaths ... OK. $ENTITY Now tell papa what 's up , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY if I 'm not mistaken ... ... I should probably make some space on a table or something then . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I guess I can decide where to display stuff later ... .
$ENTITY Well then , $ENTITY let 's round up a few others and meet in the event plaza , ... X
$ENTITY Yo ! $ENTITY They call me $ENTITY ! You know , since that 's my name and all ! $ENTITY When I came here on a camping trip , ... practically ordered me to move to ... So $ENTITY I packed up my bags and moved ! ... I hope you 'll show me around town sometime , ... !
Man , those neon tetras , ... I could eat these while juggling chainsaws ... . It 's a bit risky for amateurs though ... . Come to think of it , $ENTITY I have no idea why I 'd want to juggle chainsaws while trying to eat ... Oh well , ... down the hatch for you !
I used to live in $ENTITY , you know . $ENTITY Do you know ... from there ? $ENTITY That $ENTITY # x0 ; y $ENTITY # x0 ; al $ENTITY is like a celebrity in ... Partly because $ENTITY # x0 ; does n't have fur or feathers . $ENTITY But also because $ENTITY # x0 ; 's a genuine ... !
$ENTITY It is SO like $ENTITY to decorate with flowers . She must love that $ENTITY smell !
$ENTITY I think I 'll take a walk around and look for a place to build my house .
$ENTITY Hey , guys ! $ENTITY Is it a party ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Say what you will about ... but our museum is second to none . $ENTITY Just look at this collection ! $ENTITY It 's quite an accomplishment to collect so many rare specimens .
Let 's just take a look ... .
$ENTITY There are times in your life when you just got ta throw caution to the wind ! $ENTITY This whole year , for instance ! $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY is gon na be my best year ever ! I 've only got 12 months , so ... chaaarge , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's $ENTITY April Fools ' Day $ENTITY , so I 've got ta be ready for anything ! $ENTITY You too ! $ENTITY Do n't let your guard down today , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Is this a symptom of a cold , or is it something worse ?
$ENTITY I totally ca n't picture $ENTITY as $ENTITY a pumped-up bodybuilder . $ENTITY But he has $ENTITY ! $ENTITY He 's probably trying to get all macho . $ENTITY I wonder if he 's trying to impress anyone $ENTITY with his muscles ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's dark , it 's wet , and it 's cold . $ENTITY It 's hard to have tons of fun when it 's raining out , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I thought the walls had their own unique smell , and then I noticed the flowers . $ENTITY Smells good , though ! $ENTITY
You know , $ENTITY I feel like there are a lot fewer weeds around town lately , ... ! $ENTITY I wonder if someone is pulling all the weeds on a regular basis ... . Huh ? $ENTITY The mayor ? ... Oh , $ENTITY I guess it 's because of the ordinance we have ... Well , either way , $ENTITY it 's nice that we keep our town all clean this way , ... .
$ENTITY I guess this is why I 'll never understand sports ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Anyway , I wonder what $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY is gon na give me this year ... I hope it 's $ENTITY carpet $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY here we go ... .
$ENTITY I picture a sort of romantic night ... What do you think ? $ENTITY

$ENTITY It 's the thought that counts , and this was a good thought ! $ENTITY It hurts to admit it ... but we girls ca n't keep fighting forever .
$ENTITY What , did you open this ? But this is n't even yours , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I bet guys fight over ya all the time , right , ...
$ENTITY Oh ! Who ... ? ... Wait . $ENTITY I know exactly who you are . $ENTITY You 're ...

$ENTITY You see a guy talking , you think he 's the smart one , but maaan , that guy who 's just listening , he 's a GENIUS . $ENTITY

$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY since you 're here celebrating $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY , $ENTITY you might as well do it right . $ENTITY If you think it 's just like $ENTITY Autumn Moon ... think again . $ENTITY We get delicious dumplings during Chuseok !
$ENTITY Look , ... I asked you here for a good reason ! $ENTITY I borrowed this thing a while back , but I forget whose it is ! $ENTITY Any chance it 's yours ?
$ENTITY I 'm trying to rearrange your room in my head ... . But I think you 've got it perfect , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Do n't worry , ... I 'm still right behind you . Keep on truckin ' . $ENTITY

$ENTITY Freshly fallen snow makes getting presents feel all the more special , ... !
$ENTITY You might spill some change by forgetting to close your wallet . $ENTITY Be sure to keep an eye on it ! $ENTITY
This unbearable heat ... I do n't think I can take anymore ! Someone turn on the air conditioner ! Hmm ? You use them inside ? That 's a shame ... .

$ENTITY Yo ! ... Heh heh ! Surprise ! $ENTITY While I was still living in my old town , $ENTITY convinced me to move here ! $ENTITY Long story short : here I am ! $ENTITY Now that we 're neighbors , I hope we can become pals ! $ENTITY !
This can hold a lot more than anyone would suspect ...
$ENTITY Main Street is kinda up on high ground , so you can see a long way ! $ENTITY If you come here around this time when there 's hardly any people , you notice stuff like that !
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY # x4 ; Reese ... I 'll take this item today !
Hello ? Oh , $ENTITY , $ENTITY are you in there , ...
I got a purple feather ! It was yearning for my net !
$ENTITY Welcome back , ... I was just worrying that maybe you were gone for good . I 'm so relieved to see you again $ENTITY that I 'm actually tearing up a little ... . Waaaaah ! $ENTITY Thanks for coming back !
$ENTITY Huh ... . Seeing your face takes me way back ... . It was over a year ago , if I 'm remembering right ... . We had a mayor who looked just like you who left town one day and never came back .

You 're $ENTITY , are n't you ? ! $ENTITY Where 'd you go to , ya big meanie face ! $ENTITY Everyone was worried that you 'd never come back !

$ENTITY Like , whoa ! I just heard the wildest story ever . $ENTITY I do n't even know if I believe it ! $ENTITY Apparently , somewhere in this very town , $ENTITY there 's a $ENTITY rock that spits out money $ENTITY when you hit it ! $ENTITY Maybe it 's a true story $ENTITY But either way , if you have a shovel , $ENTITY no reason not to try hitting rocks , right ? $ENTITY And if you score a lot of cash from some rock , there 's an easy way to gather it all up in your . $ENTITY Just open your and select the money . $ENTITY Then drag it over to the other money so that they overlap . $ENTITY Totally easy peasy ! And you 'll have a little extra space in your pockets for all that cold , hard cash !
No , I just do n't think this is going to work . It 's just not right for me .
$ENTITY But why ? I really , really wanted to go hide ! $ENTITY Oh , I get it . You do n't think you can find me ! $ENTITY Well , maybe we 'll do this some other time , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ugh ... This will never end .

$ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was really fun ! I got to eat lots ! $ENTITY But it was n't enough ! ... Next year , I 'm gon na eat ALL of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's food , ... !
$ENTITY Oh , wow , $ENTITY is that right ? $ENTITY That sounds pretty good to me ! $ENTITY But $ENTITY you said this is your first time there , right ? Does that mean you have n't even seen your house yet ? $ENTITY I 'll get a place there . I 'm sure I 'll be fine .

And , $ENTITY well , $ENTITY I just wanted to check to make sure you were n't moving away or anything in real life .
$ENTITY I 've been thinking recently ... maybe my room is clashing with the $ENTITY ? But I just do n't know what should go in the $ENTITY 's spot . $ENTITY It 's a tough situation . $ENTITY I need you to choose a replacement $ENTITY for the ... I 'm counting on you , $ENTITY !
Oh ... OK. $ENTITY I guess it was worth a try ... . Let me know if things change !

$ENTITY You only got 1 round right , $ENTITY so you have to buy my $ENTITY . The price is $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I do n't know if you believe in luck , ... but I sure do . $ENTITY There are certain items I just KNOW are lucky . $ENTITY I have one I carry around all the time . $ENTITY It just so happens my lucky object goes really well with most of my outfits . $ENTITY What a coincidence ! $ENTITY So if you find yourself in need of a lucky break or two , $ENTITY think about picking up a lucky charm . $ENTITY I 'd recommend one that matches your eye color .
$ENTITY I thought we were friends , bro ! $ENTITY How could you not know me ? !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY hello . $ENTITY It 's nice to meet you ! My name is ...

I 'm happy to meet a new neighbor , $ENTITY though . $ENTITY I hope we can chat more once I 'm all settled in !
$ENTITY Hey , ... , $ENTITY I hope you 're not thinking about lighting those fireworks . $ENTITY Setting off fireworks this early in the morning is incredibly rude ! $ENTITY People are trying to sleep .
$ENTITY Hah ha ! $ENTITY No wonder I was seeing the similarities between the two of you the other day , ... !
yum ! $ENTITY A little sweet , yet a little bitter ... I could really get used to this flavor !
I hope this gift is thanks enough for all your work , $ENTITY .

I heard that cat say that you saved everyone else in town from tricks as well ! $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY You 're definitely the hero of $ENTITY ! We 're lucky to have you here for major crises !
$ENTITY The capsule 's mixed in to the $ENTITY letter $ENTITY section of your stuff , so go bury it and come back . $ENTITY Do n't tell anyone ! $ENTITY And do n't open it , $ENTITY duh !
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems like you 've been putting in some time pulling weeds around town ... . I hope you keep up the good work and continue to keep this town free of the naughty little sprouts !

$ENTITY What brings you way out here to $ENTITY so late at night , ... ? $ENTITY Did you realize it 's been night FOREVER today ? What a relief the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY is almost over !
$ENTITY Wow , $ENTITY you found it for me ! $ENTITY Thanks ! $ENTITY I was just about to dig it up myself . $ENTITY Wait a second ! $ENTITY Did you ... Did you open it ? ... But ... opening it would have been the best part .
$ENTITY I 'm trying to create a space that keeps my mind and body healthy . $ENTITY My $ENTITY helps me relax , $ENTITY and $ENTITY it makes the air cleaner too .
$ENTITY My $ENTITY # x0 ; ... Sorry . $ENTITY I ca n't sell that even if you offered all the money in the world ... Ms. Bugsy and I are just too close !
$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY You really did it ! ... This issue might finally get the attention it deserves ! $ENTITY And I should probably give you a reward for your hard work ... Please take this ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY What would you like to sell ?

$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY Have we not met ? ... I 'm called $ENTITY , since that 's my name . $ENTITY A while ago , I visited on a camping trip when this nice person named $ENTITY I 've been in my new home for about a week now ... . Anyway , $ENTITY it 's nice to finally meet you ! ... !
Your birthday is close to a holiday , $ENTITY is n't it ? ... Does that mean you get 2 presents in a row ? $ENTITY You lucky duck !
$ENTITY I ca n't believe I placed higher than you in the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY , ... But do n't feel bad . $ENTITY I was just really on my game today .
$ENTITY I gave you $ENTITY candy $ENTITY , so you do n't have a reason to stick around , right ? ! ... In other words , $ENTITY GET OUT !
$ENTITY Hi , ... It looks like we 're both feeling $ENTITY extra cheerful this morning , ...
But I may not be so kind next time , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I hope we have an $ENTITY un $ENTITY der $ENTITY stan $ENTITY ding .
$ENTITY All kinds of craziness is possible today , so stay on guard !
$ENTITY Sometimes you have to just go ahead and eat that last cookie . Maaaan , if you do n't , who will ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Mornin ' , ... . $ENTITY But it sure does n't feel like morning ... . It 's a little bit gloomy , actually .
Today happens to be one of the days we 're putting on a $ENTITY fireworks show $ENTITY . It makes me very happy to have a special guest from out of town to enjoy it with us !
$ENTITY Whaaat , $ENTITY are you serious ? !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY You 've already got your hat on ? ... That 's the $ENTITY I know ! $ENTITY I better get mine on too !
So ... . I came up with an idea to increase the lovability $ENTITY of our humble town of $ENTITY ! ... Great idea , right ? $ENTITY I know you agree ! Oh ! And I 'll tell $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY too ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Yeah , I guess it 's really more of a dessert than a preworkout energy kapow .
$ENTITY I was thinking you might like to buy this little item . Normally you 'd pay Bells ... But today , $ENTITY your lucky price is only $ENTITY Bells ... Sounds good ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY If there are so many languages in the world , maaaan , that must get REALLY confusing for the aliens ... $ENTITY
sometimes think that all the letters are just magically delivered into their mailboxes . $ENTITY That 's not how it works at all . $ENTITY I deliver each letter by hand , but I work so fast that nobody sees me drop the letters off . $ENTITY I 'm like a postal ninja !
$ENTITY When I look up , sometimes I see floating $ENTITY feathers ... If you 're collecting feathers , I 've got a secret for you ... But I think I 'll tell you later .
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY I should be saying that to you , $ENTITY you impostor !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! ... Why ... $ENTITY are you so formal ... ? $ENTITY is watching , you know ...

$ENTITY I just realized my place might not be very clean , ... But you 're the type who can appreciate well-used living quarters , right , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Check it out , ... I 've completely recovered ! $ENTITY Thanks to you , I 'm back to my day- long workouts ! $ENTITY I got you a little thank-you gift ...
$ENTITY OK , you 're right . I 'm the one who found it , so I should return it . I 'll deliver it myself after all .
$ENTITY Even I think I 'm a bit crazy for going camping out of town $ENTITY in this cold weather ... $ENTITY But now that I 'm hooked , $ENTITY I just ca n't help myself !
$ENTITY Ugh ! $ENTITY I do n't like the sound of this ! $ENTITY Yeah , I guess flowers are OK ... What about it ? $ENTITY I do n't even want to imagine where you 're going with this !
, are you positively sure ? $ENTITY All right . $ENTITY Please feel free to talk to me when you 'd like to use a room !
$ENTITY Well , that 's too bad . $ENTITY Um , bye then , ... .

$ENTITY Happy New Year ! $ENTITY Hey , we made it through another one ! Awesome ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY has finally gotten a little warmer ! $ENTITY But if you want to get a taste of summer 's heat a bit early , sprout ... come to my island at any time !
$ENTITY If you 're not into the whole rain thing , you should take cover in someone 's house , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Do n't worry about weirding anyone out . $ENTITY Everyone in $ENTITY likes visitors , ... !
$ENTITY This letter , $ENTITY it 's got me all fired up about writing now , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Thanks for your hard work ! $ENTITY All we have to do now is let it age for a little while ! $ENTITY When it 's time to dig it up , $ENTITY I 'll want you to get in on that , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Arrgh ! This is pointless !

Remember me ? $ENTITY When I was camping here , someone from this town told me I should live here , $ENTITY so here I am ! But it does n't look like they even live here anymore ... And to top it off , I 've got a cold ! I 'm sure I 'll feel better soon , so come back then ! ... Ahchoo !
$ENTITY Welcome to ... It 's supposed to get even colder as the night goes on , ... !
I just love finding a hidden treasure in a secondhand shop like this . $ENTITY It 's so exciting ... . !
$ENTITY Hmm , $ENTITY I 'm looking for a little insight on interior design . $ENTITY I want to get something to replace my ... If you find something you think would work , $ENTITY could you please bring it over ?
$ENTITY And then you just brought it here like that ? $ENTITY You got ta lotta nerve ! $ENTITY Look , I know we 're both girls . But you ca n't just poke your nose into my business !
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I 'm glad you caught me ! $ENTITY # xE ; I had no idea you wanted me to stay in $ENTITY . Do n't worry . $ENTITY I 've changed my mind . $ENTITY I 'll be sticking around here for a while . $ENTITY As long as we can still be good friends . $ENTITY Sound good ?
$ENTITY It must be fate , $ENTITY the two of us meeting here like this ! What else could explain it , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Hey , I did n't say it was MY $ENTITY favorite phrase $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I know it 's a little goofy , but it seems to suit $ENTITY . $ENTITY What ? ... Look , I know it 's $ENTITY April Fools ' Day $ENTITY , $ENTITY but would I lie to you ? ... Do n't answer that .
$ENTITY Now , I bet you think I adore all things sweet , but that 's not exactly true ... When it comes to $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pies , I hate all that syrupy , gooey sweetness . $ENTITY But here 's the perfect solution : $ENTITY honey ! Just a dab of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY evens out the flavor . $ENTITY That way , you get a dessert that 's perfectly sweet and adorable $ENTITY just like little ol ' me !
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY This is way too big ! ... If you 've got something smaller $ENTITY , can I have that , ... ?
$ENTITY Oh , great ! Why do n't you show me what caught your eye , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY has ... And it 's even nicer than mine ? $ENTITY , this is n't fair !
$ENTITY What did you wish for , ... If you tell me , $ENTITY I promise not to tell the birthday-wish committee . But I will tell everyone else in town so we can help make it come true ! $ENTITY Will you share it with me ? $ENTITY OK . It 's ... It 's a secret !
$ENTITY What are you talking about ! $ENTITY You 're the fakebro ... bro !
I 've got a passion for a particular kind of fruit , $ENTITY , but it only grows in other towns . Yes , the ... has bewitched me . I must eat one ! Can you get it for me ? $ENTITY Well , OK ! No way .
$ENTITY So $ENTITY I 'm thinking about making ... -based art design ! $ENTITY I know it 's not a rare fish ... but it has a really cool shape to it . I could go hog wild with it ! ... you 're good at fishing , right ? $ENTITY Would you catch me ... I need to see one up close ! $ENTITY Leave it to me ! Ca n't right now .
$ENTITY
! $ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Man , look at us having fun ! $ENTITY This is a great Halloween ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Mmmm , $ENTITY it sure feels amazing $ENTITY to be outside at night like this on New Year 's Eve , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I 've been holding back a big tip until I was certain you 're the kind of person I could trust . That is , $ENTITY trust not to take pictures of me when I 'm not looking ... . Now I know you wo n't do that . Press and hold to get your camera ready , $ENTITY and then press to snap the picture . $ENTITY Easy . You can look at your pics in the $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS Camera $ENTITY application . $ENTITY Since I told you the secret , never take a picture of me unless I 'm looking my best , OK ?
$ENTITY But I really DO love the color . So maybe I 'll stick with it anyway .
$ENTITY You should pop on over to my house , and we 'll see how it stacks up to $ENTITY 's . $ENTITY !
... Oh no ! $ENTITY I 'm out of beans ! $ENTITY I guess you win , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY
Having so many shops in the area $ENTITY almost feels like we 're throwing parties all year long !
Hey , today 's that one day , right ? $ENTITY The day we celebrate the coming of spring ? $ENTITY Then you should make sure to get outside and enjoy the fresh air ! $ENTITY You might even find somethin ' good if you look hard enough !
$ENTITY Do n't tell $ENTITY , $ENTITY but I may $ENTITY steal some of his interior-design ideas , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's another step ... toward becoming a grown-up , ... !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY catching is n't going to be easy . $ENTITY But I know you can do it , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Great timing , ... I 'm thinking about changing my catchphrase . $ENTITY Got any suggestions ? $ENTITY I need help , ... I 've got one ! There 's no need .
$ENTITY What ? ... Oh , I do n't know ! ... It 's , like , an overall $ENTITY impression I 'm getting ! $ENTITY Is n't that good enough ? Huh ? ... Prince of $ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY , back me up . Does n't $ENTITY look like the Prince of $ENTITY today ? $ENTITY Yeah , he does ! $ENTITY ? Prince ... ?
ENTITY Aha ! I knew that 's what you 'd say ! ... Wait . $ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY Ya do n't have enough money for it ! $ENTITY Ya tryin ' to pull a fast one on ol ' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY ? ! Come on ! $ENTITY Stop with the bad jokes !
$ENTITY Sorry it took so long !
$ENTITY Yo , ... I was looking all over for you ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY What are you talking about ? ! $ENTITY It 's totally obvious that , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY YOU 'RE the impostor !
$ENTITY I 'm so not surprised $ENTITY has $ENTITY in his room . $ENTITY Fish have , like , $ENTITY this totally calming effect . $ENTITY I bet he just sits and stares at that thing for hours .
$ENTITY Ha ? You 'll do it for me ? ... I was sure you 'd say no ! $ENTITY In that case , $ENTITY could you please find $ENTITY boys from outside $ENTITY who are willing to sign the petition ? $ENTITY Here . $ENTITY Make sure people sign on this paper and ONLY this paper .
I guess by the tone of your voice , $ENTITY `` plain '' is n't a compliment , is it ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY next time I go clothes shopping , $ENTITY I 'll try to get something really over the top , ... .
$ENTITY When you 've got a $ENTITY mixed salad $ENTITY with lots of stuff in it , $ENTITY you 're going to want to toss some $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY in there . $ENTITY If you add a flashier flavor , $ENTITY you run the risk of it overwhelming the taste of the other ingredients . $ENTITY Give it a try ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's like a fossil party in here ! We 're so lucky to have such a great exhibit here !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY That 's even worse ! $ENTITY Then I ca n't tell anybody that I read $ENTITY ! $ENTITY So stop reading MY book ! $ENTITY Find something else to read , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Chilling out is so much better $ENTITY when you do it with other people !

Though you would n't guess it because of their size , giant trevallys are actually a type of mackerel . Unlike normally slim and sleek mackerels , giant trevallys have wide , silver bodies . Surprisingly , though , these fish can not tolerate the cold , so they tend to live in warmer places . Their jaw strength is great enough to bite off a person 's finger , so be very careful when fishing for them !

$ENTITY Right now we 're fine , $ENTITY but something is bound to happen once the town is clear of visitors ... That 's when the mystery of $ENTITY April Fools ' $ENTITY will be unleashed on us all !
$ENTITY Thank you ! ... It 's so nice getting compliments like that ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY If you use plain fish in $ENTITY fish salad $ENTITY , it just ends up smelling fishy ... So what you need to use is $ENTITY lemon ... Lemon punches that fishy smell right in the face ! Amazing , is n't it ? ... Do n't forget ! Fish plus salad plus lemon equals knockout win !
$ENTITY I did n't even say anything yet ...
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You taking off ? $ENTITY Yeah , I should probably head home then . $ENTITY See you , ... Let 's do this again sometime , $ENTITY !
ENTITY For your second-place finish , $ENTITY I give you the $ENTITY silver fish trophy ...
$ENTITY I wanted to give you something , $ENTITY but it looks like your pockets are full . $ENTITY I 'll just mail it to you , ... .
$ENTITY Get this : $ENTITY I just saw $ENTITY Jack $ENTITY with his pumpkin head on ! $ENTITY And believe it or not , $ENTITY he asked me to be his henchwoman this $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It 's a tough job , $ENTITY but it has great benefits . $ENTITY I do n't know ... I think I might say yes !
$ENTITY Hey , ... I think today 's show is gon na be super sweet , ... .
$ENTITY Cicadas have amazing stamina ! $ENTITY They make their sounds nonstop , and they do n't get tired ! $ENTITY I need to study them and learn the secret of their endurance ! ... It does n't matter what kind . Just catch me a $ENTITY cicada ... OK ! No , thanks !
Sisters [ CLOSED ]
$ENTITY Coo ... I 'm pleased to hear that ... .
$ENTITY Hey ! ... I called your bluff and decided to move here ! $ENTITY I said good-bye to $ENTITY , even though it was tough . $ENTITY That means I got nowhere else to go , $ENTITY so I 'll be relying on you quite a bunch now , ... !
Redd 's Cookie Congrats ! You got a crackle prize !
... Huh ? $ENTITY You 've $ENTITY got your pockets full ! $ENTITY So I ca n't give you any $ENTITY candy ... It 's like our little game never happened !
This year 's almost over ! $ENTITY It 's a little bit sad , but at least we have $ENTITY Countdown $ENTITY on New Year 's Eve to look forward to ! $ENTITY We can have a good time saying good-bye to ... .
$ENTITY Here 's a little thank you for that , even though it strayed a bit from what I wanted . It 's $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
ENTITY Pav $ENTITY knows how to make you move .
$ENTITY Wow , $ENTITY it 's the new mayor ! $ENTITY Welcome to ... You swept into town like a movie star ! $ENTITY And I just know you 're going to turn $ENTITY into an amazing place ! $ENTITY I hope we 'll be pals , $ENTITY so you do n't mind if I call you $ENTITY instead of Mayor , right ?
$ENTITY Checking out the town , huh ? $ENTITY News flash : $ENTITY IT 'S COLD ! $ENTITY But that 's what happens this time of year ! $ENTITY At least it gives you a great excuse $ENTITY to cuddle up closer to that toasty , warm fire !
What ? $ENTITY So you do n't know if things are cool between us or not ? $ENTITY Aw , maaaan . $ENTITY I wonder if we can still patch things up ... .
Ugh ... There 's a fancy card too ... That 's so like him , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY You lost it ? ! ... Are you just trying to be all cool and stuff ? $ENTITY Darn ... # x0 ; $ENTITY I think you took that whole `` I 'm young , so I 'm rebellious '' thing too far , ... .
$ENTITY Hmm ... This does $ENTITY NOT feel right on my tongue . $ENTITY Where 's the sweet deliciousness ? The bold boldness ? $ENTITY Listen , honey , $ENTITY I came here for the $ENTITY blended $ENTITY coffee . Not this dreck ! $ENTITY Try to remember next time .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY If you add sweetness to hot dishes , it tones down the spiciness and just makes them all-around delicious ! $ENTITY For example , $ENTITY coconut $ENTITY in $ENTITY tom yum kung $ENTITY makes for a perfect combination , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY But you need to go diving for the freshest-possible lobster to make good $ENTITY tom yum kung ... It 's quite a chore , $ENTITY but it 's totally worth it because it 's so good !
$ENTITY I see ... Yes ! That 's amazing ! $ENTITY What a concept ! $ENTITY It 's revolutionary ! $ENTITY I feel like I 'm seeing clearly for the first time in ages ! $ENTITY Truly , thank you , $ENTITY
$ENTITY I 'll be careful not to lose it again !
$ENTITY Why are you wearing ... like that around town ? ! $ENTITY Even if you 're just lounging at home , $ENTITY there 's no excuse for wearing filthy clothes !
$ENTITY I picked out something I thought would match your home 's style ... So hang it up if you like it ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Mya ha ha ! ... Well , it 's still pretty strange to decide to up and move all the way out there so suddenly . $ENTITY At any rate , I sure hope you have a really nice time living in $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
One cup is $ENTITY 200 Bells ... How about it ? $ENTITY Certainly , old chap ! Not right now .

$ENTITY A huh huh huh ! $ENTITY Thanks for the compliment ! $ENTITY It makes me feel twice as tall ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait for the Happy Home Academy $ENTITY to come judge my place now , ... .
$ENTITY Happy birthday to you , $ENTITY sweet $ENTITY ! Didja get that awesome birthday card $ENTITY I sent to you ? $ENTITY It 's seriously , $ENTITY the best card I 've ever written . $ENTITY It gets kind of emotional , so try not to cry !

Aw ... Now I got ta get more $ENTITY candy ... !
Sigh ... . It 's not easy gathering up treats , ya know . $ENTITY
for waiting ! $ENTITY If you want to open the gate for visitors , just let me know . Eek eek !
ENTITY Well , old bean , the time has come $ENTITY for the awards ceremony to begin . $ENTITY Please make your way to the tent ! $ENTITY Keep in mind that if you wait too long , $ENTITY the ceremony will be canceled . You have until $ENTITY 9 p.m. $ENTITY !
Living in a tent ... You 're pretty outdoorsy , huh ? $ENTITY What ? You 're just living in it temporarily until your house gets built ? I guess I understand . $ENTITY Living in a tent is really gutsy , $ENTITY but at the end of the day you want a nice house to live in , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh ... Uh ... I guess I just never thought of you as a baby .
$ENTITY Thanks for delivering that gift ! So tell me what happened ! $ENTITY Here 's the story ... I ca n't remember .

$ENTITY Do you know about the $ENTITY Night Owl $ENTITY law we have here in ... As you can guess from the name , it 's a rule that supports those who like to stay up late . $ENTITY Thanks to this rule , the stores stay open late ! $ENTITY It 's a huge help for us creatures of the night !
$ENTITY Oh ! Welcome !
$ENTITY This might sound strange , but ... ye look like one o ' them movie stars ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY If it 's $ENTITY you 're making , try adding a chopped $ENTITY apple $ENTITY as a secret ingredient . $ENTITY It 'll make things nice and crispy !
$ENTITY It 's not a cheap purchase , $ENTITY so I should probably listen to your advice , ... .
I know . $ENTITY You 'd never think that a grown-up $ENTITY like me would still have a stuffed bear . $ENTITY But I love it SO much ! I do n't know what I 'd do if I could n't hug my $ENTITY !
I really hope I 'll someday understand $ENTITY 's choices in furniture a little better , ya know ? $ENTITY I do n't plan on taking a peek in his stuff just to find out , though .
$ENTITY Yo ! ... I 've finally started packing up my stuff for my big move tomorrow ! $ENTITY Promise me you 'll feel a little lonely after I 'm gone , all right ? ! $ENTITY I mean , why else would I move ? $ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh , I see ... . I find it handy to include a present with my letter if I 've been too busy to visit someone .
$ENTITY NO WAY ! ! $ENTITY Really , $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY How generous of you ! $ENTITY Well then , I 'll gladly do the deal ! $ENTITY I 'm gon na get a little choked up , but here you go $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Your house sure is something ! $ENTITY It 's all anyone talks about ! ... So $ENTITY are you OK with all that attention ? $ENTITY says losing your privacy $ENTITY can totally stress you out !
$ENTITY Gah ! ... Something is following you !

This ... is the one you want , right ? ... Let 's see what your last card is ... . You got the dandelions ! $ENTITY Heh heh heh . $ENTITY I think you used up all your luck at the beginning !
$ENTITY Could I have a cup of coffee ? $ENTITY With $ENTITY a lot $ENTITY of milk please !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY decided to keep $ENTITY right in his room ... I see ... He probably uses it to help weigh his CDs so he knows just how much he loves his favorite bands .
$ENTITY There 's some interesting stuff in here ... I wonder what he does with the ... Maybe ... developed a new interest with styling his hair ? If so , $ENTITY I have a few tips I could pass on .
$ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY That 's too bad ! ... Wow , I guess I have to go deliver it myself !
... # x0 ; Q

$ENTITY
The fossils I 'd like you to find are on display in this island 's 3 $ENTITY sample rooms $ENTITY . Your job is to find the fossils on display and fill the display room next to it with the same fossils ! You ca n't just throw them in there all willy-nilly , though . $ENTITY You need to make sure the new fossils are organized in the same way as the replica fossils . If the three of you can get that done within $ENTITY minutes $ENTITY , you 'll be rewarded with medals !
$ENTITY Is that you , ... You look kind of wild ...
ENTITY In third place ... With a fabulous $ENTITY -inch ... , it 's ... ...
$ENTITY has done a pretty good job $ENTITY do n't you think ?
$ENTITY It 's not good to judge people like that , ... Especially since , well , ... I actually have a thing for $ENTITY !

Visiting $ENTITY 's place $ENTITY is giving me great decoration ideas ... . I 'm totally gon na copy some of them !

Dabs generally have both eyes on the right side of their body , though there are some exceptions . Both types of dabs begin in infancy with an eye on each side of their body . As dabs grow , the eye on the left migrates to the right , though sometimes it does n't move at all . Dabs dig in the sand to hide , which allows their eyes to stick up a bit to watch for danger . Because they live off of bugs and small creatures , their mouths are small , containing narrow , dull teeth .
