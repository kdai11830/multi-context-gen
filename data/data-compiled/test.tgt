$ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY made for me one day ... I still remember it , ... It was so good that it brought me to tears , $ENTITY though that made it taste sort of salty for some reason ...
$ENTITY
... =

The chirping sound you often hear from male crickets is emitted by the stridulation of their wings . Crickets ' ears are located just below the middle joint of each front leg . While this seems odd to us , it helps them easily pinpoint where various sounds are coming from .

$ENTITY Ta-DAAAHHH ! ! $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY ! I bet you 've been waiting for me for , $ENTITY AGES ! $ENTITY But I 'm finally here ! $ENTITY Remember what you said to me when I was camping here ? $ENTITY You said I just $ENTITY HAD to move to this town ! $ENTITY So I did ! $ENTITY I needed a fresh start , and I think $ENTITY is just the place to do it !
$ENTITY I was invited by $ENTITY . That 's how I decided to move here ! $ENTITY I hope you do n't mind if this town gets a bit noisier now that I 'll be doing my training here !
$ENTITY So I guess the plan is to put some big fossils in this area . $ENTITY There 's not much to see now , but just imagine ! Grrrr ! $ENTITY !
... Ya know , we seem to be catching each other 's gazes a lot today ! ... It 's awkward ... .
$ENTITY Good evening , ... If you go jumping into puddles , $ENTITY be sure to dry off later , ... .

$ENTITY I 'm so glad we have a place like this !
$ENTITY You 're early , ... Well , come in , come in !
$ENTITY Cough cough ... . Cough ... . Cough ! $ENTITY I ... My fever ... . Blah ... .
Now that I think of it , ... you get older , but never look older ! $ENTITY You always appear so youthful ! $ENTITY You must have some secret that you 're not sharing with us ! $ENTITY I bet it has to do with your music sense !
Huh ? $ENTITY Why not ? $ENTITY Two-story houses are so awesome ! $ENTITY You can do it ! $ENTITY Just save up a bunch of Bells , and show us how it 's done ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Sunday is my day to sit here with a cup of coffee and my calendar for the week .

$ENTITY Thanks for agreeing to bury my $ENTITY time capsule ... Did you notice I put it with your letters to keep it safe ? $ENTITY Also , $ENTITY please remember not to open it . $ENTITY I 'm counting on you to bury it without peeking .

$ENTITY Just as you 'd expect , the shopping district is pretty sparse this time of day ... . Well , there are worse things .
$ENTITY Hey , ... it 's pop-quiz time ! $ENTITY What do you think is easily the most important aspect for a man to live his life by ? ... # x0 ; ... K ... kindness ? Strength ! OORAH ! I do n't know . What brought this on ?
$ENTITY Those better be ... Bean Day $ENTITY beans in your hand , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY And I hope you know $ENTITY how to use them ! $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY just throw them around $ENTITY and drive away the ogres . $ENTITY It 's pretty easy , $ENTITY actually !
$ENTITY Yaaawn ... $ENTITY I can fall asleep anywhere ... . And $ENTITY 's place $ENTITY is so comfy , $ENTITY I get extra sleepy , ... .
ENTITY I was able to put together a fine , fine $ENTITY , all thanks to your help ! $ENTITY Every ingredient you brought was of the highest quality ! Really top shelf ! $ENTITY If only it had a little something extra , $ENTITY some hidden , maybe secret ingredient of some sort ... But , hey , $ENTITY it 's definitely good enough without it ! $ENTITY Anyway , to thank you for helping me , $ENTITY I 'd really like you to have this $ENTITY !
$ENTITY

Pondskaters distinguish themselves by having the ability to run on the surface of water . They have a mouth part that lets them suck up bugs that fall on the water 's surface . Their wings allow them to freely move to different parts of the water 's surface if the need arises . Some say they smell like candy , which is a rather curious association to make in the insect world .
$ENTITY No way ! $ENTITY I was thinking , you know , just like this ... $ENTITY Thinking about you ! $ENTITY And here you are , $ENTITY !

Dung beetles are famous for the exact thing you 'd assume they 're famous for . In fact , they use their namesake both as a source of food and a place to lay their eggs . Dung beetles are very strong and can roll things 10 times the weight of their bodies . One species can even pull objects 1,141 times its weight , which is like a human pulling 6 packed buses !
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY Are you going somewhere , ... Then I should probably leave too . $ENTITY Thanks for having me !
$ENTITY I 've camped in lots of different places , but $ENTITY sure seems like a great place to live ! $ENTITY Maybe it 's 'cause the snowy scenery here reminds me of my hometown ... You 're here visiting from some place else too , right ? $ENTITY Let 's enjoy ourselves here , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY If you 've got the inside scoop on furniture that 's on the smallish side , tell me about it !

$ENTITY , $ENTITY that 's a good one ! $ENTITY Everyone knows $ENTITY wants to be $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Come on in ! Make yourself at home , $ENTITY .
I caught a firefly ! Now I 'm glowing with pride ! ... mm $ENTITY
$ENTITY Really ? $ENTITY A huh huh huh ! $ENTITY I did n't know I could pull off this kind of outfit .

... $ENTITY That 's something special ! $ENTITY I would n't expect anything else from this caf 's house blend !
$ENTITY Yo ! $ENTITY There you are ! $ENTITY You did n't forget you told me that I should live in $ENTITY when I was done camping , did you ? $ENTITY 'Cause I 'm really here , and I really did it ! $ENTITY And that means now you 'll have to put up with me .

$ENTITY When you get tired of playing with friends , $ENTITY press $ENTITY START $ENTITY and then select $ENTITY End the multiplayer session $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Good morning , $ENTITY . Guess I made the right decision . I almost stayed in bed this morning ! $ENTITY The sun is hibernating today , after all . Glad I did n't sleep in , $ENTITY or else I 'd have missed YOU , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY So I wrote that , huh ?
He who believes he has a pure heart is probably just a beast in denial . ( # 37 )
$ENTITY Today 's hide-and-seek session was the most fun I 've had in ages ! ... Let 's definitely do it again , ... !
... You told me a real man provides a safe escort for a lady , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY That 's why I had $ENTITY come and get you $ENTITY to show you I know how to have a lady walked around ! $ENTITY So what do you think ? $ENTITY I 'm a real man now , right ? $ENTITY ?

Please let me know if you collect any more . I 'll be waiting for you !
You bought 5 oranges costing 100 Bells each , $ENTITY 6 apples costing 80 Bells each ... and 5 peaches costing 120 Bells each ... . How much do they cost altogether ? ...

Hmm ... $ENTITY I may be super strong , but I just do n't have the strength to try this on ... .
$ENTITY So I 'm just gon na give you the cash directly . Easier that way !
Pill bugs live in moist places , which is why you will commonly find them under rocks and in stumps . When they 're touched , they roll into a ball . Oddly enough , they 're part of the crustacean family . As such , and since they do n't like dry places , they can travel for a short time underwater if need be .
$ENTITY You 're too late ! ... already found me a little bit ago ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I feel like those who come to visit will get bored fairly quickly . ... please help us out if you can , ... !

$ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY is just what it sounds like . It 's a tool that you use to catch fish ! You can not use it indoors , though . When you are outside , $ENTITY equip it from your $ENTITY pockets window $ENTITY ! If you see a fish 's shadow in the water , toss your bobber out by pressing . The goal is to put that bobber right where the fish will nibble ! $ENTITY When the fish has taken the bait and the bobber completely sinks , $ENTITY press again to reel it in ! $ENTITY The point is to quickly reel it in $ENTITY before it gets away . $ENTITY So tricky ! $ENTITY Good luck !
Apparently , listening to $ENTITY makes $ENTITY all weepy . I hope he does n't start crying . $ENTITY If he does , I do n't know if I 'll be able to hold back my own tears !

$ENTITY Your home ? Dignified exterior . Just like a mayor 's place should have .
$ENTITY Huh ? Did you $ENTITY REALLY just give me a bunch of $ENTITY TRASH for my birthday ? $ENTITY I 'm , like , confused ... $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I get it ! $ENTITY It 's a practical joke ! $ENTITY You 're a funny one , $ENTITY but there 's no $ENTITY WAY I 'll accept this !

$ENTITY Now I feel bad ! ... I really have to do a better job of apologizing , $ENTITY .

You would n't have believed your eyes ! $ENTITY Make sure you always check the stump after you chop down a tree . $ENTITY Maybe you 'll see something too !

$ENTITY Hold up ! I have n't seen you before ...

Man , that sounded really dumb ! $ENTITY Come live in my town ! That did sound dumb !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Nowadays , nobody values guys who refuse to use umbrellas in the rain .
$ENTITY Be careful not to trip on any of my boxes , OK ? ... .
$ENTITY Huh , really ? ... Never mind then ! $ENTITY !
In the end , $ENTITY your cost for my furniture is $ENTITY Bells ... I really hope you like it at least !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY That was n't quite what I wanted , but here 's a little something . It 's $ENTITY !

$ENTITY I know this fun game called Cost-a-Lot . $ENTITY To play , $ENTITY you draw lots that set the price of my items .

$ENTITY Other people might call this place a mess , but if it works for you , then what 's the problem , right ? $ENTITY Home is what you make of it ! Am I right or am I right ?
$ENTITY I organized my stuff so I could make some money to pay for traveling ... Care to buy something ? $ENTITY Actually , let 's make a game out of it ! ... Let 's play Five Chances ! $ENTITY How about it ? $ENTITY Wan na play ? $ENTITY # x0 ; Of course ! No , thanks .
... So what do you think ? $ENTITY It looks good ! ...
$ENTITY Hey , ... There you are ! $ENTITY Do n't say anything ... Just follow me .
$ENTITY , $ENTITY the show 's over . $ENTITY Oh well , nothing lasts forever ... . Except for canned beets , $ENTITY of course .

$ENTITY So what did you wan na talk to me about , $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! ... Welcome to $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 'm sort of interested in the $ENTITY but I worry I ca n't afford stuff that spendy ... # x0 ; $ENTITY Do n't worry . Just buy ! Save your money .
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY did n't remember leaving it ? ! ... If I knew that , $ENTITY I 'd have just kept it ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I got something really good today ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY must really enjoy learning new things ! $ENTITY Learning how to play something like the $ENTITY is probably just one hobby of hers ... I wonder how long she 'll keep it up , though , ...

$ENTITY This place is still pretty empty , ... It 'd be kind of sad if it stayed like this , $ENTITY so I 'm thinking of displaying some of my own works .
$ENTITY Hey , ... You brought a present for me , right ? I mean , 'cause you 're my pal ... Of course ! Uh-oh .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY If she grabs my hand , $ENTITY I 'll just spin myself around $ENTITY and do a reversal like this ... and then that ... OK ! $ENTITY Got it ! ... Gim me your best shot ! ... Here ! ...
You did ? $ENTITY Uh , was there something good today ? Never mind . I 'll go there and read it myself . $ENTITY There 's often news about upcoming events or special visitors . You can leave your own notes too . $ENTITY Now , here 's a big tip . If you see a little $ENTITY bird $ENTITY on the board , that means there 's new ... . uh , $ENTITY news . $ENTITY But the weird thing is that you wo n't see that bird at night . You 'll see a ... . Well , I wo n't spoil it for you . Who will be there ? Who ? Who ? ... Hah ha ! I crack myself up !
$ENTITY You should come check out my place and compare it to $ENTITY 's ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY But ... why would you name your album that ?
$ENTITY I got ta give you something nice in return , or the world will be uneven ! ... Here ! $ENTITY Have this !

$ENTITY
$ENTITY Promise me you 'll take care of the ... OK , ... ?
You COULD just take it , you know , ... .
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Look who just got to town ! $ENTITY
Oh ... That 's too bad ... . Maybe I 'll try it on again some other time ... . But for now , it 's back to my old clothes !
$ENTITY Hey , ... Hard at work in the rain , huh ? That 's impressive ! $ENTITY It 'll be meaningless if you catch a cold , though , so do n't overdo it , all right ? ... ?
$ENTITY I just love the $ENTITY Harvest Festival ... The only bummer is that we have to wait another year for the next one !
$ENTITY All right . $ENTITY ? $ENTITY ? You kids hear that migratin ' honkbill what just passed by ? Yarrr ...
$ENTITY I feel like my room has just about all the style it can handle ... But my feng shui is getting totally thrown off as a result of the $ENTITY , you know ? ... Can you go and find me a suitable replacement for the $ENTITY ? Please ?
ENTITY Sure ! $ENTITY You are more than welcome ! $ENTITY What would you like to sell ?
$ENTITY So if I do that , $ENTITY I 'll have to take care of that other thing . $ENTITY But that other thing is a problem too ... $ENTITY Oh , you kind of caught me in the middle of working out a problem . $ENTITY Talk to me later , OK ?
$ENTITY But she 's here all the time ! Is n't that right , Mr. $ENTITY Nook $ENTITY ? Here all the time . No qualms about it . Boom .
$ENTITY Who the heck brought the $ENTITY here ? $ENTITY It 's so completely out of place in $ENTITY , but ... I ca n't take my eyes off it ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY By the way , $ENTITY , are you off to work now ? $ENTITY You 've got on a super-cool $ENTITY with the $ENTITY ! ... You 're ready to go ! $ENTITY Good luck out there , hero ! ... Protect the peace in ... !
$ENTITY Wow . $ENTITY Is my $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY working ... I feel a bit better ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Not at all . $ENTITY Let 's hear it !
$ENTITY I do n't know what 's going on here , $ENTITY but I do n't like it .
$ENTITY It 's so sunny today ... . If it stays like this , I bet we 'll be able to see a lot of stars tonight !
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY well look who it is ! $ENTITY Nice suit ! $ENTITY And happy $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY to you !
$ENTITY Aha ! $ENTITY So you ... brought the $ENTITY I asked for ? $ENTITY It 's all yours ! I 'm tapped out .
$ENTITY Let me give you a little bit of free advice that 'll help you as you move forward here . You ready ? ... You got ta keep your game face on ! $ENTITY I do n't know why , but this town is just packed full of weirdos ... Some people get freaked out at first . $ENTITY But deep down everyone 's really nice ! $ENTITY And we 're all counting on you to make this place even better ! $ENTITY Oh , and one more thing ! $ENTITY You can get good advice on living here from the folks at the town hall . $ENTITY Do n't hesitate to ask for help !
$ENTITY It 's almost countdown time ! $ENTITY This is soooo exciting !
$ENTITY is currently playing from the $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Good things will happen if you can blow out all the candles at once ! $ENTITY Do n't hold back ! $ENTITY Give it all you got !

$ENTITY Thank you so much for returning it ! $ENTITY In fact , $ENTITY I 'd like to give you a reward . $ENTITY It 's not much , but $ENTITY how about my $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY
ENTITY ? Nice place . You bought a house ? Congrats !
$ENTITY I often spill my coffee when I 'm walking around with it . $ENTITY Coffee stains are hard to get out , $ENTITY so be careful with your drink !
$ENTITY Since you found a place to live now , $ENTITY I can finally send you some letters ! $ENTITY I 'll probably write you a letter soon , ... so keep an eye out for it ! $ENTITY And , you know , you can write me a letter as well if you 'd like ! $ENTITY You can easily find $ENTITY stationery ... on Main Street at $ENTITY Timmy and Tommy 's shop $ENTITY ! They should hook you up ! $ENTITY Once you 've written the letter , ... you can send it from the $ENTITY post office $ENTITY ! Yeah , kind of obvious , right ? $ENTITY Oh , ... but do n't write anything weird , $ENTITY 'cause I 'm gon na show your letter to everyone in town , OK ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY I hope you have fun celebrating the $ENTITY Lunar New Year $ENTITY today !
$ENTITY I really hope $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY brings me a $ENTITY doll ... One with pretty hair !
$ENTITY I 'm not giving you any hints ! $ENTITY You 'll just have to wait until you open it later .
$ENTITY I 've always had the sneaking suspicion there are people living on the moon . $ENTITY Today is $ENTITY Tsukimi ... so I 'm gon na try communicating with those moon people telepathically . $ENTITY B-beep $ENTITY bee-beep $ENTITY b-b-bee-beep ... Whoa ! $ENTITY I got a reply ! ... It says ... $ENTITY `` We 're $ENTITY ve $ENTITY ry $ENTITY bu $ENTITY sy $ENTITY right $ENTITY now ! $ENTITY Call $ENTITY back $ENTITY la $ENTITY ter . '' $ENTITY Aw , man ! $ENTITY I guess I should 've known they 'd be extra busy on the day of the moon festival , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Have as much fun as ya can now . Ya ai n't gettin ' no younger ! $ENTITY
I wonder what $ENTITY is doing with $ENTITY ? That is SO not how I picture her ! $ENTITY Maybe she 's trying to become a pro wrestler or something ! Well , ... at least she has big dreams , $ENTITY right ?
$ENTITY Graack ... Aack-hack ! $ENTITY So s-s-sick !
$ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Let 's open this up !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I 've prepared a little something to go with our $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY celebrations . $ENTITY Please stop by when you 've made some room in your pockets !
$ENTITY This was great and all , but next time , be sure to bring me what I actually asked for , ... .
ENTITY Say now , $ENTITY who might ye be spendin ' yer time with on the island ? $ENTITY No one ! Other travelers . Abandon ship !
And signed ! $ENTITY Hope you get lots of people to sign it !
$ENTITY Huh . $ENTITY I did n't know $ENTITY was into ... The $ENTITY creates a really great sound too ... I feel like I just found out something new about him , ... .
$ENTITY Heh heh . $ENTITY I figured you would n't be real busy or anything !
All of the $ENTITY fireworks shows $ENTITY for this year are over now ... . But do n't worry , because they 'll be back next year !
$ENTITY Snow on $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY ... $ENTITY Good work , snow !
, chum !
$ENTITY has , like , a really good eye for art ! $ENTITY I 'm totally in love with that $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I can totally picture $ENTITY on that $ENTITY and $ENTITY chowing down bowls of ice cream !
$ENTITY Is that a no ? $ENTITY Well , I thought it was a pretty fun idea ... .
$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Here we go ! $ENTITY Summer in $ENTITY is getting fancy , ... !
$ENTITY I do n't see $ENTITY falling for that one , $ENTITY but OK ...
$ENTITY This $ENTITY kind of reminds me of ... Plush-animal owners really do look like their plush animals .
The feast is all over , ... It was one for the books !
$ENTITY Truth is , ... was pretty persistent , so I agreed to move into town here ! $ENTITY I 'm sure I 'll come by to say hi after the big move , but I just thought you should know , ... !
$ENTITY I 'd better put in more time window shopping ! I ca n't decide what to buy , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's almost time for the $ENTITY Harvest Festival ... one of my favorite times of the year ! $ENTITY I 'm going to start my preparations now instead of panicking at the last minute . $ENTITY This year will be different !
All right , $ENTITY . $ENTITY You invited me here to ... so now you have to help me find a place to live ! $ENTITY But do n't worry . $ENTITY I 'm not super picky or anything . $ENTITY Any ordinary manor or estate with an ocean view will do just fine ...
$ENTITY
I know , I know ... You 're thinking , `` Wow ! That is one resistant snowlady ! '' But I wo n't last forever ! And I hope to see you next winter !
$ENTITY Uh-oh , $ENTITY that was close ! ... You plan on bopping me with that hammer when my guard 's down , do n't you ? !
Hmmmm . $ENTITY Well then ... .
I caught a jewel beetle ! A real diamond in the rough ! ... mm $ENTITY
Man , I absolutely do n't have ... and I do n't know what to do ! $ENTITY Here you go ! Sorry . I do n't have one .
$ENTITY was talking about how she cut her nails too close , and while I was listening ... I started imagining how much it must have hurt her , and I just burst into tears ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY You 're always so nice , ... I wanted to repay your kindness with a present ! $ENTITY Here $ENTITY I got you this !
$ENTITY All right , $ENTITY what do you think ? $ENTITY Does it $ENTITY look good ? $ENTITY Looks good ! Could be better .
$ENTITY Heh ... Yeah , this is a real nice spot for just sittin ' and thinkin ' about stuff . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ugh ... S-so $ENTITY v-very $ENTITY c-cold ... I must be sick .
$ENTITY It 's almost ... # x0 ; $ENTITY something that 'll knock ... # x2 ; 0 socks off , ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Now that I 've decided to move , I 'm getting excited ! Things are about to get nuts ! ...
$ENTITY I feel like I wan na stay up all night sipping some tasty $ENTITY with you ! ... Why is that ? !
$ENTITY I better not look inside my wallet . It 's pretty empty right now .
$ENTITY
Nah , too big ! ... Ca n't you think of something the same size as my $ENTITY ?
Well , $ENTITY that does n't seem very much in the spirit of $ENTITY Festivale ... but whatever ...
$ENTITY A mole , huh ? $ENTITY That makes me think of those mole brothers . $ENTITY You know them ? ... Sonny $ENTITY and $ENTITY Don $ENTITY ? I know $ENTITY Sonny $ENTITY seems fierce , $ENTITY but the older brother , $ENTITY Don $ENTITY , is actually the scarier of the two . Do n't believe me ? Just look into his eyes sometimes . $ENTITY Pure intensity , staring right back at you .
... =
Ugh ... My head hurts so much ...
Oh , nothing ? OK , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Go on ! Scram ! $ENTITY
ENTITY Tell me now , would ye care fer a wee bit o ' mood music $ENTITY fer this pleasure cruise ? $ENTITY Sure would ! No thanks .

$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You do n't seem to have enough Bells ... And I ca n't go any lower on price , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Got my ... What 's the holdup ?

$ENTITY Heh heh ! Right ? ... is making progress every single day ! $ENTITY I hope you 're having fun with your duties as a mayor in your town ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Lavender is one of my favorite fragrances , $ENTITY but wo n't I just stay up all night sniffing my pillow ? $ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY That magazine has never led me astray in the past . $ENTITY I 'll give it a try . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Great timing ! $ENTITY Why do n't we get into a flexing contest ? $ENTITY Biggest deltoids wins it all ! ... Sure ! No , thanks ! No , you muscly nut !
$ENTITY This might seem a little weird , ... but can I ask you a question ? ... Be brutal . $ENTITY What do you think of me ? $ENTITY Super nice Super scary
$ENTITY That gets me thinking ! ... You really do n't have a specific food you eat for moon days like this , right ? $ENTITY Well , here we eat a type of rice cake we call songpyeon ! $ENTITY It 's a soft cake that looks just like the moon ! ... Kinda clever , right , ... Cake 's always clever .
$ENTITY
Hmmm ... Seems kinda strange to see a fancy picture decorating $ENTITY 's place ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY is a painting even I 'm familiar with ... You do n't think it 's real , do you ?
ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY you 'd like to put something out in the flea-market space ?
$ENTITY Well , looks like I 'm gon na be your new neighbor then ! You should think of this as a major victory ! $ENTITY Once I 'm done camping , I 'll go home and start packing . Time to get super excited , $ENTITY !
... . Oh boy . $ENTITY You think I 'm scary , $ENTITY huh ? ... But you know you ca n't judge a guy by the shirt he wears , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Sometimes you have to dig deep to discover $ENTITY qualities like kindness and sincerity , you know ? $ENTITY Of course , $ENTITY you ca n't find kindness and sincerity if they just do n't exist in someone . $ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Right here is the spot with the best breeze in ... Best place to be if you 're ever feeling down . $ENTITY The wind from the sea will hit ya and make you feel all better ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Yay ! It 's time for some $ENTITY Festivale ... I 've been dancing since I woke up this morning ! $ENTITY Sorta made breakfast a pain , $ENTITY but it was worth it !
$ENTITY Do n't you just love the smell of fresh coffee ? It 's a very grown-up aroma . $ENTITY But kids probably should n't drink it !
Speaking of $ENTITY Toy Day ... not just anyone can pull off a Santa suit . $ENTITY But on the right person , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY you know , $ENTITY SANTA for example , $ENTITY it looks great !
ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Yeah , I 'll try adding in some of this right away ! $ENTITY All right ... I 've got all my ingredients and everything now ... .
$ENTITY Well , I guess I could have made a different offer ... . But maybe I 'll just pass it up .
$ENTITY Morning , $ENTITY . I must be psychic or something . $ENTITY I totally thought it would rain today , ... .
$ENTITY Never thought $ENTITY would be the kind to have a hobby like raising ornamental plants . $ENTITY I suppose that 's all right , though . $ENTITY Everyone 's got ta have a hobby , even if it 's weird ! ... GAHAHA !
If it 's not one thing , it 's another . ''
$ENTITY I 'm thinking this will be a year to remember ! ... I better start planning my fitness routines right now ...
$ENTITY I 'm not miffed or mad or anything !
... You 're right ! ... Sometimes it 's not so bad to make an impulse buy now and then ! $ENTITY Even if said impulse buy is gon na come back and hurt me later ...

$ENTITY Hey ! Big news ! ... Pelly $ENTITY and $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY are forming a band ! $ENTITY Gon na call 'emselves $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait to hear 'em ! $ENTITY That 's so cool ! You lie like a rug !
ENTITY Just kidding around , $ENTITY huh ? $ENTITY All right , ... let 's talk later .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY That 's what I figured . They seem to just call people whatever they want , like `` boo '' or `` baby '' or `` shawty '' ... Sometimes , it can be hard to follow when you just want a love song ... At the very least it seems to refer to someone they really care about , so I suppose I 'm down with that . $ENTITY Do you get it now , $ENTITY shorty ?
... You 're full of life no matter where you are ! ... !

$ENTITY Today 's a perfect day for cleaning ! $ENTITY Not just here , but everywhere ! So it might be fun to visit other towns $ENTITY and pitch in on the weeding there too !

$ENTITY Oh , ... Heh , I totally forgot I put this thing in here ! $ENTITY What else ... Ha ! $ENTITY Look ! $ENTITY Check out this crazy , rambling letter !
$ENTITY Have you decided what you 're going to do first this year ? ... I 'm going to eat some $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Sort of far ? Smart choice . Yeah , this part of town $ENTITY right around here $ENTITY is n't optimal .
Ah , $ENTITY . ... I stayed up late last night , $ENTITY and now I 'm sleep deprived , as in $ENTITY Y- $ENTITY A- $ENTITY W- ... .
$ENTITY Yo ! $ENTITY We meet again , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I bet you think I adore all things sweet , but that 's not exactly true ... $ENTITY When it comes to $ENTITY coconut tarts $ENTITY , you can really get overwhelmed by all that syrupy , gooey sweetness . $ENTITY But here 's the perfect solution : $ENTITY honey ! Just a dab of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY evens out the flavor . $ENTITY That way , you get a dessert that 's perfectly sweet and adorable $ENTITY just like little ol ' me !
Also , as long as it 's not a fossil , $ENTITY you can take home anything you find here on the island ! If you need some other tools , go rent them from $ENTITY Lloid $ENTITY !

$ENTITY You must have gone to lots of trouble to get it . So take this , $ENTITY .
Sorry , $ENTITY . I 've got to be heading home . Let 's do this another time , OK ?
ENTITY Thank you much ! $ENTITY You 've paid your home-renovation loan in full , which is no small feat , yes , yes ! $ENTITY And you did it so fast ...

$ENTITY Really ? Well ... I guess it 's your loss . $ENTITY It 's a really fun game ! $ENTITY Lem me know $ENTITY if you feel up to it later .
$ENTITY I got ta observe everything carefully to find a good bargain !
$ENTITY Sorry . $ENTITY I ca n't let you have that . $ENTITY
$ENTITY AUGH ! ... You 're not part of the exhibit , are you ? ! $ENTITY Oh , I get it . $ENTITY You 're only here to look , $ENTITY .
Ca n't go wrong with freshwater goby , no , sir ... . Boil it , fry it ... Does n't matter ! $ENTITY Best in a soup , though ... . Or , $ENTITY you know , $ENTITY just eat 'em raw like I do ! That 's how real fishers do it ! ... OH YES , YUM !

Zzzz ... zzzz ... Nngah ! ... I guess you can even tell when I 'm pretending to be asleep ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Now I know who I can always count on when I need just the right fruit , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY It was bright all day long , like a never-ending afternoon !
$ENTITY Yeah , I kind of agree ... .
ENTITY Oh , you need someone to weed ! $ENTITY Ah , yes , I 've noticed myself how bad it 's getting out there lately ... . $ENTITY But , if you ask me right now , I think I should be able to get it all nice and happy by early tomorrow morning . $ENTITY It 's pretty bad though , so it 's gon na cost ya $ENTITY 50,000 Bells $ENTITY . $ENTITY What do you say to my offer ? $ENTITY Yes , please ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Like , how $ENTITY is really good at ... . That could help you tell them apart ! $ENTITY Only the real $ENTITY would brag about that , right ? $ENTITY Wow , look at me go !

$ENTITY Me and mornings usually do n't mix ... 'cept on rainy days ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Stick to chocolate and comic books . $ENTITY You 're too young for love anyway .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Are you out for a bit of bug catching ? ... Well , fine ! Keep up the good work , ... !

When you register someone you are playing with as your best friend , you can look at their TPC anytime . Also , when you open your ticket gate , you can determine specifically which people can visit your town . However , these restrictions can only be set when you are connected online via the Internet . When you set the best-friend restriction , only best friends will know when your ticket gate is open . Furthermore , when you become each other 's best friend , you can exchange online messages . You can do this even when you are located in different towns entirely !

$ENTITY I 'm trying to figure out where to live . $ENTITY Near the sea ? $ENTITY Or somewhere with a ton of trees ? Some stores nearby would be nice ... Man , where the heck should I live ? !
, $ENTITY so close ! $ENTITY It 's the same size as the current top fish . $ENTITY Sorry , but early entries come first , $ENTITY so yours 'll be $ENTITY listed as the second- largest fish . Rules are rules !
$ENTITY What a cute sofa , ... It looks so perfect for those times you just want to curl up and dream about $ENTITY .
$ENTITY You can tell a lot about people $ENTITY by looking at their bookcases . $ENTITY , for instance , has everything alphabetized ...
$ENTITY That $ENTITY just shows how nurturing $ENTITY is .
$ENTITY Do you think we could go hang out at your house , ... I know it 's quite sudden ... but I 'm really curious to see the inside of your place . $ENTITY Sure . Sorry , no .
ca n't edit your designs while on the island !
$ENTITY So you 've got that strange feeling too , ... There has got to be some connection ! $ENTITY What could await you in this new town ? ... Just thinking about it is enough to make my heart race ! $ENTITY , $ENTITY I 'm sure you 're gon na find something great in $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hmm ... Like it needs ... more pizzazz or something ? $ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Next time , I 'll surprise you !
Hmm ... When I 'm fishing , I think of all sorts of deep stuff . $ENTITY Like , stuff that 's out of my depth !

I just had a brilliant idea . $ENTITY You should totally give that honey trick a try !
$ENTITY Happy birthday ! $ENTITY So $ENTITY were you really surprised by your surprise party ?
$ENTITY Starting over in a new town without any friends is kind of like playing life on hard mode .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I 'm not sure if you 'll like it or not , but the three of us picked it out for you . $ENTITY I hope you 'll find a use for it !
$ENTITY I ca n't remember a morning that 's been as busy as this one ... . Festivale $ENTITY is such a raucous holiday .

Now you know !
$ENTITY Well , it 's not really my goal to impress everyone I meet with my clothes .
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY You do n't know about the $ENTITY bulletin board $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY bulletin board $ENTITY in front of the $ENTITY train station $ENTITY has all sorts of info about the town on it .

Why do n't you try writing something as a test ? $ENTITY Also , $ENTITY you should keep your eyes peeled for a $ENTITY bird $ENTITY hanging around the board . $ENTITY If you see a bird there , $ENTITY it means there 's a new message .
So you 're going to be like that ... Well , $ENTITY let me know if you change your mind , $ENTITY I guess .
ENTITY Great , great ! That 's fantastic ! $ENTITY OK , first choose where to save it in your designs , and then choose the picture you want !
$ENTITY It 's nice to just kinda $ENTITY veg out like this , ... .
$ENTITY Do n't you ever want to experience a new place , ... Of course , I love everyone in this town , but ... On the $ENTITY of next month , I 'm venturing someplace new . $ENTITY Do n't go ! Good for you !
$ENTITY You 'll do it ? Thanks , $ENTITY !

They attach to hard places , and though they look like bivalves , they are related to shrimp and crab . Some species are even edible and have a very crab-like taste to them , making them a fine delicacy . Young acorn barnacles come from eggs , do not have shells , and float around the ocean like shrimp . They gradually develop their shells as they grow into the image we usually see .

$ENTITY I 've seen some pretty big fish in the water today . $ENTITY Good thing I 've never liked swimming much .
$ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY That 's not what it means to be `` hardheaded '' ! $ENTITY It 's means your thinking is behind $ENTITY the times and stubborn and ... Wait ... $ENTITY Is that what people say about me ? $ENTITY Am I really that hardheaded ? $ENTITY Huh ... I never thought I 'd learn so much about myself at your place .
Just be careful , OK ? !
$ENTITY Every item here has a story behind it . $ENTITY Do n't I sound super deep when I say stuff like that ?
$ENTITY Listen up ! $ENTITY I $ENTITY got my present handed to me by Santa himself ! $ENTITY Can you believe he came here just for me ? $ENTITY The present he gave was n't quite what I wanted , but $ENTITY I guess that happens sometimes ! Oh well !

$ENTITY
$ENTITY I had fun playing our game , $ENTITY but now I need to focus . $ENTITY Besides , $ENTITY you ca n't scare me if I know it 's you !

$ENTITY Mmmm , what a juicy fruit this $ENTITY is !
Ya know , those guys who always talk about their town 's plans for greatness are n't always great . $ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You do n't have one of those ? !

Scarab beetles have elegant , metallic-looking bodies and are shinier even than fruit beetles . They 're so shiny that they 're said to gleam like gold . They 're very rare and can be sold for high prices . Like all beetles in the scarab family , the outer shell provides a very thick layer of protection from predators . The high value and golden shell do make them more vulnerable when it comes to Bell hunters , though .
$ENTITY This is the place to see and be seen in ... I would n't say I `` dress up '' just to come down here , $ENTITY but I definitely take a peek in the mirror first .
$ENTITY Hey , did you hear ? ... Nook ... is going on a blind date ! $ENTITY Sweet ! Not a chance .

$ENTITY I 'm so determined to be a good guest , ... it 's making me anxious .
Though typically pale in color , these aquarium fish also can be found with rather beautiful patterns . This is all thanks to very selective breeding of carp with genetic mutations , allowing for diversity . No two koi have the exact same pattern and are popularly known as `` swimming jewels '' as a result . They can be sold for a very high price , depending on their coloring and pattern . If properly cared for , they can live for over 100 years , making them a staple for outdoor garden ponds .
The yellow butterfly is similar to the common butterfly , with the two easily mistaken for one another . Males are more often a yellowish color , and females are more often white . The larvae feed on plants of the Fabaceae family , such as milk vetch or white clover .

$ENTITY I wonder what kind of things we 'd find in $ENTITY 's ... . $ENTITY I 'm guessing she has a lot of fancy imported food .
$ENTITY Can I confide in you ? $ENTITY I pressed some $ENTITY between books to make decorations later . $ENTITY Then the other day , $ENTITY I mistook them for tea leaves ... $ENTITY And I accidentally made $ENTITY drink my pressed-flower tea ! $ENTITY Please do n't tell ... # x0 ; $ENTITY about it !

... seems kinda nervous ! $ENTITY It 's like she thinks we 're over here for some sort of surprise inspection or something ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
ENTITY You look great with makeup and great without makeup , so spend your days however you like !
$ENTITY 's bookcase $ENTITY has a lot of books on fashion $ENTITY and home dcor $ENTITY and etiquette and stuff . $ENTITY I should probably read a few of her books ... I could use some tips on being less of a slob !
$ENTITY It feels good to get a good deal ! $ENTITY Good deals are good !
$ENTITY Ugh ... My body feels so heavy , I 'm having a hard time moving , ... .
$ENTITY Oh , come on ! ... Darn it , dude ! $ENTITY I was just staring down that bug ! ...
$ENTITY Just between you and me , I want $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY to bring me $ENTITY clothes $ENTITY .
$ENTITY
All right then .
$ENTITY Oh , and this is urgent , but you can do it tomorrow . No later than that , though , OK ?
$ENTITY Understood ! $ENTITY Now I know exactly what you want ! $ENTITY Let 's start $ENTITY styling !

$ENTITY Having a big hardware store like this in the area is so handy ! $ENTITY I keep on finding reasons to come here , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY That soup $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY made was amazing , was n't it ! $ENTITY I think I had about 9 gallons of it ! $ENTITY Still , if he brought out a dish with a little more heft to it , I would n't complain at all ... Either way , I 'm already looking forward to next year 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
I 'm disappointed that the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY awards ceremony was canceled . $ENTITY I wanted to congratulate everyone !
$ENTITY Happy birthday ! $ENTITY You do n't look a year older ... but I have no doubts you 're a year wiser .
$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY thanks ! $ENTITY That 's so sweet of you ! ... I 'm not going to see light $ENTITY I 'm gon na see tears ! ...
$ENTITY Course , printing 1,000 pages of content on that topic ... $ENTITY Yeah , that was maybe a little crazy . $ENTITY It was so thick , I got a workout just carrying it around ...
$ENTITY That 's enough to net you a Bronze Tortimer award and $ENTITY # xE ; * ... # x0 ; ls m $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY !
Wow , in the middle is never a good thing when it comes to style . $ENTITY That 's what I say , anyway . $ENTITY I 'm tempted to change into something else , but maybe I 'll stick with this a little longer . $ENTITY ;
$ENTITY Right now ... I ca n't exactly respond to you . I need some time . $ENTITY
Being free from the hectic weekdays , $ENTITY just spending time without doing much ... And having a nice cup of coffee $ENTITY while talking to friends ... $ENTITY This is my $ENTITY ideal Saturday !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Do n't let your guard down now just because you found me ! $ENTITY Go hurry up and find the others !
These short and stocky river- dwelling fish have a lot of slender teeth for tearing apart other fish . Freshwater gobies dig holes under rocks in riverbeds to make nests for eggs , which the males guard . Other fish breeds take advantage of this protective quality and often lay eggs in goby nests .

$ENTITY Did you know about the existence of $ENTITY high-value sale items $ENTITY at the recycle shop , $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY ? $ENTITY It 's a system where they give you more money than usual for items you sell . $ENTITY The chance of high-value resales seems to increase when you get StreetPass involved ... .

So make sure you make him look good , ... !
$ENTITY Zipper T. Bunny $ENTITY was dancing at the plaza earlier , ... I 'm actually surprised . $ENTITY He has some pretty sharp moves ! $ENTITY Though his head looks like it 's kinda heavy for all that moving ... .

... You 're not seriously $ENTITY thinking about this , are you ? ! It 's just a joke ! ... I mean , `` $ENTITY `` ? What does that even mean ? ! $ENTITY This is not really up for consideration !

These former tadpoles prefer to live near ponds and other damp and swampy places . They dwell on land , so they have lungs and skin as opposed to a set of gills . They like to stick close to water because they require a nice , moist lifestyle . Frogs are moist because they emit a liquid to protect their skin from dryness . If too much moisture evaporates from their thin skins , they could have trouble breathing . It 's better not to handle frogs , as some species are poisonous , even to the touch !
$ENTITY OK , $ENTITY get ready ... . It 's ... What do you think ? Pretty cool , right ? $ENTITY Yes , I like it ! Yuck .
Do you get along well with $ENTITY It 's not that I do n't like her , $ENTITY but when the two of us are alone , $ENTITY I 'm not sure what we should talk about . $ENTITY It 's just a little awkward , ... .

I 'm sure everyone would be happy if you took part in the event too , Mayor . $ENTITY Please join us tonight !
$ENTITY So the sun not being out today does n't necessarily make the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY the coldest day of the year . $ENTITY I guess the amount of daylight we get does n't really have any bearing on how cold it is .

I 'm sure you 've noticed , $ENTITY but things between $ENTITY and $ENTITY are pretty tense right now . $ENTITY They do n't even say hello when they run into each other on the street . $ENTITY I 'm worried about what might happen if they do n't make up soon , ... .
$ENTITY I 've always been the type not to use any special seat covers , but ...

$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY Thanks so much ! $ENTITY I 've been looking all over for one of these ! $ENTITY I hope it was n't too expensive . $ENTITY I 'll have to make something nice for you in return , ... .

$ENTITY Do you think you could teach me to be more assertive ? $ENTITY I 'd like to try speaking my mind more often .

$ENTITY # x0 ;
I got up early this morning to get ready , $ENTITY so I 'm glad to have someone stop by to check things out !
. .
Guess what $ENTITY wants for $ENTITY # x0 ; ... birthday . $ENTITY Give up ? $ENTITY # xE ; ... # x0 ; wants `` $ENTITY . '' $ENTITY I think it would be really nice if we could make that wish come true . $ENTITY What do you think , ... Can you help me let people in $ENTITY know ? $ENTITY I think the more people know , $ENTITY the more likely it is to happen .
Hey , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Sorry to cancel at the last minute , $ENTITY but I already had something on the calendar $ENTITY I completely forgot that I was planning on ... Can we do it some other time ?
$ENTITY I got a present ! $ENTITY I actually wanted something different , $ENTITY but I 'm still happy .
$ENTITY I 'm not sure about that ... . But ... basically , you prefer to have muscles that can easily master $ENTITY . ... Am I right ? !
$ENTITY Ooh , ... So relaxing ... I could go for a dip right now . $ENTITY How about a little privacy , $ENTITY eh , ... ?
$ENTITY Zzzzzz ... # xE ; ...
$ENTITY Something terrible has happened , ... My good friend $ENTITY ate the candy I was saving for later ! $ENTITY I had great plans for that candy ... . He had to know that ! $ENTITY Words ca n't describe how upset I am . $ENTITY He 'd better get on his knees and beg for forgiveness , ... !
You wo n't have much luck trying to find bugs here . $ENTITY I mean , we barely have any at all , ... . $ENTITY Why ? ... Perhaps the people in this town are n't really fans of bugs .
$ENTITY Cooking is fun and all , but I thought it 'd be a little easier than this ! $ENTITY It 's , like , a real skill , you know ?
$ENTITY Aw , $ENTITY that 's awful ! $ENTITY Chili stains !
$ENTITY
ENTITY OK , $ENTITY you 're all set ! $ENTITY Thanks for your cooperation .
$ENTITY I 've got a hankering to play some hide-and-seek . $ENTITY I really want to run around outside ! $ENTITY Will you play with me , ... I 'll play . Not today .
You can buy just about any tool you need from ... T.I.Y . $ENTITY on Main Street .
$ENTITY Guess I should be going now ! $ENTITY You 've got some stamina , $ENTITY ! We should work out sometime ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hello , hello , hello again ! $ENTITY Rainy days are just the best ! ... And me ? Even better !
$ENTITY No ! You did n't ! $ENTITY You took it from someone else 's yard ? Without asking for permission ? $ENTITY You know , $ENTITY that makes your flower much more special . $ENTITY So thanks for the thoughtful gift !
Well , to tell the truth ... . I know it 's pretty awful too , ... But it 's just hard hearing it like THAT , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY So on the spur of the moment the other day , I sorta bought ... . But to be honest , $ENTITY this is n't the sort of thing that really suits me , $ENTITY so I 'm trying to unload this item now . $ENTITY Would you want it ? $ENTITY Would you consider buying it for $ENTITY Bells ... Sure ! I do n't need it .
$ENTITY Keep it $ENTITY basic $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Do n't worry about me anymore ... But that impostor 's definitely gon na pop up in someone else 's house ! $ENTITY You 've got ta go save everyone else from these tricks , ... !

$ENTITY Please enjoy your time in beautiful $ENTITY today !
$ENTITY I wonder what kind of year the next year will be ... I hope I 'll be able to spend next year just like this one ! This town and everyone here is like family to me !
$ENTITY Aw , man ! I really wan na eat some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY now ... . $ENTITY But I ca n't ! ... Jack $ENTITY will get mad , $ENTITY !
I 'm not so sure if I can trust your sense of direction anymore , but ... OK , ... Stay focused !
$ENTITY Why is it that some furniture always makes me so relaxed all the time ? $ENTITY I suppose I 've gotten to the age where I can finally appreciate that kind of stuff ? ... ?
$ENTITY It is not ! $ENTITY That 's just something you made up . I 'm not going to fall for your dumb tricks .
$ENTITY Now it 's time for our drink report ! $ENTITY What IS the most popular drink this week , ... . $ENTITY . $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY tomorrow 's the yearly $ENTITY Harvest Festival ... I heard the guest of honor is a chef named $ENTITY Franklin ... I wonder what he 's gon na make ...

Four Fs ! $ENTITY Better make sure you 've got all of those !
$ENTITY This got sent to $ENTITY 's place by mistake ? $ENTITY It 's not like ... # x0 ; $ENTITY to just open it without checking with me ... Actually ... ...
$ENTITY I 'm starting to worry whether I 'll get anyone at MY inevitable party . You think anyone will show up ?

$ENTITY Get it done !
... Take a look at the night sky when you get the chance ... I 'm sure you 'll be surprised ! ... It 's so very romantic . It looks almost like it 's not real ...
$ENTITY I ca n't wait to see what this looks like when I get home !

$ENTITY I 'm so totally stoked that you got me $ENTITY ! You 're the bee 's knees , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY that was my first kiss ... Are you crazy ? $ENTITY What kind of story would that be ? !
ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY party 's all done . Turned out to be a lot of fun ! $ENTITY Always gets me ready for cooking ! $ENTITY Well , you know , ... MAKING food , not BEING cooked ! I 'd hate `` cooking , '' if you get my drift ! $ENTITY Gobble !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY Hah ! $ENTITY I was gon na try and surprise you ... but I guess you found me out ! $ENTITY Remember me ? ... It 's ... I just moved here recently ! $ENTITY Since you mentioned $ENTITY , I 've wanted to come and check it out for myself ... Things are still kind of a mess , $ENTITY but stop by and say hi later , OK ? $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's the $ENTITY I had in this spot until now ! $ENTITY Let me know if you like it or not !
$ENTITY I love the way fireworks $ENTITY brighten up $ENTITY even the liveliest night of the new year ! $ENTITY They totally inspire me !
$ENTITY Bring me $ENTITY horse types from other towns $ENTITY . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY But do n't get cocky ! I wo n't lose next time , ... !
$ENTITY Heya ! ... I ca n't tell you why , but I need you to come with me , ... .
It 's ... $ENTITY to use it during the day ... but it 's ... $ENTITY at night ... . What is it ? One more time ! $ENTITY It 's ... $ENTITY to use it during the day ... but it 's ... $ENTITY at night ... . What is it ?

$ENTITY What 's wrong , ... Are you nervous about something ? $ENTITY If you 're nervous because $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY is coming , $ENTITY you 'll end up ruining your health , so do n't stress ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's ... Thank you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY So , ... do you like spicy food , by any chance ? $ENTITY I love it ! $ENTITY The other day , $ENTITY I went and caught a big lobster just to make some $ENTITY tom yum kung ... . $ENTITY It 's really a great combination of flavors ! ... I may be becoming addicted to the taste ! ... Of course , I also add $ENTITY coconuts $ENTITY to it , $ENTITY mostly to temper the flavor just a little bit . $ENTITY It 's perfect , all thanks to the extra coconuts ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I want to give you something in thanks . I hope you like it ? It 's $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ha ha , sweet ! $ENTITY Thank you !
$ENTITY I was only joking ! I 'd have to figure out the internal power structure before I could move here ... . I need to know if I can be myself here ... Ultimately that 's what 's most important , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's so nice of $ENTITY to wrap something up before returning it ! ... That 's what makes her so special !
ENTITY For the final part of the meal $ENTITY the most important course , dessertI 'll make $ENTITY ! Should n't be overly complicated . I 'll just need a few things to make it . Specifically , it 'll require ... . $ENTITY , $ENTITY and $ENTITY too ... . $ENTITY Then finally , I 'll add a special $ENTITY secret ingredient $ENTITY to make the ultimate $ENTITY ! Come back once you have all the ingredients I need ! $ENTITY Take these ! I 'll go get them .
$ENTITY A huh huh huh ! $ENTITY I know you 're trying to scare me , $ENTITY but your getup is just cracking me up ! ... I really should prank you for trying to scare me . $ENTITY But let 's play a game instead ! $ENTITY If you win , I 'll give you $ENTITY candy ... But if you lose , $ENTITY I get to prank you !
$ENTITY Whaat ? ! $ENTITY Are you kidding ? Seriously ? $ENTITY The $ENTITY Bombers called it quits AGAIN ? ! $ENTITY Every time they say they 've broken up , they just change their band name and come back , ... I guess I get the desire to change yourself to fit your mood , $ENTITY but still , that 's a bummer for the fans . $ENTITY Still , you should really try listening to their songs if you have n't . It 's good to branch out sometimes !
You came a long way today ... . Oh ! $ENTITY Do you want to be a DJ too ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Welcome back , ... .
$ENTITY Did n't expect to find ... in $ENTITY 's place !
$ENTITY It looks like there 's a new house going up in $ENTITY , ... I guess that means $ENTITY someone new is moving into town . $ENTITY I 'm gon na $ENTITY save my snack from today $ENTITY and give it to the neighbor as a housewarming gift !
$ENTITY the ... So $ENTITY the one who is n't the $ENTITY must be fake , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
ENTITY Oh ? $ENTITY They are n't here ? ... That 's a real shame , $ENTITY but what can you do , nyuk ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY It 's me , ... I hope you did n't forget ... It 's been over a week . $ENTITY I was camping , $ENTITY and you invited me to move here for real . $ENTITY You remember ? $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY good ! $ENTITY Now that we 're practically neighbors , I hope we can be friends ... . !
Actually , $ENTITY I recently had a fight with $ENTITY because of something pretty silly . Yeah , my fault . $ENTITY So $ENTITY I wanted to apologize with a gift or something , $ENTITY but I do n't wan na be the one to hand it over . $ENTITY I 'm not sure if you 're the right one to do this , $ENTITY but could you deliver it for me instead ?
$ENTITY I win ! $ENTITY But it was fun to play against such a worthy opponent .
$ENTITY This is a really messy room ! $ENTITY Put your stuff away ... $ENTITY where you got it ... $ENTITY when you 're all done using it ! $ENTITY Following these steps eliminates nearly 70 percent of all the messy rooms in the world !
$ENTITY I totally love having this beautiful $ENTITY in my room , $ENTITY but there 's just one problem ... $ENTITY It makes me feel too calm and relaxed ! $ENTITY I like a little tension and stress in my life , you know ?
$ENTITY I 'm so determined to be a good guest , ... it 's making me anxious .
Blah ... This cold just wo n't go away . $ENTITY Am I ever going to get better ?
... The $ENTITY look in clothes is just the coolest !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Check out $ENTITY that stylish hat ! $ENTITY I 'm glad $ENTITY I 'm not the only one to get all spruced up for the countdown ! $ENTITY We definitely do n't want to start off the new year on the wrong foot , $ENTITY do we , ... ?
$ENTITY I 'm gon na try a taste !
$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Ready , ...
$ENTITY For the tidiness-loving people of $ENTITY , I have ... .
$ENTITY Quite a feast this year . $ENTITY Quite a feast indeed . $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY really went all out . $ENTITY If I could offer one TINY suggestion : ... a little something sweet at the end of the meal is always nice .
Hmm . Well ... . Let 's chalk this thing up to a big misunderstanding , OK , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY
Hey , did $ENTITY and $ENTITY get into a fight or something ? $ENTITY The sparks flying between those two are getting overwhelming ... I know they say let sleeping dogs lie or whatever , but ... Well , I suppose the best thing to do here is keep quiet and wait for the storm to pass .
When someone says fly , you ask how high ! ''
$ENTITY Not too much we can do about this crummy weather , $ENTITY but I hope you enjoy yourself here anyway .
$ENTITY So many floors ! So much shopping ! It 's like a dream come true !
$ENTITY Gosh , you did n't even get any dango rice cakes ? $ENTITY I thought EVERYONE knew about those yummy treats . $ENTITY How are we supposed to get into the moon-celebrating mood without any dango rice cakes ? !
ENTITY So what do ya think ? $ENTITY The prices are impressive , yeah ? Do n't ya feel like it 's time to get a little cultured ? $ENTITY It does a body good to live in an environment full of art , ya know ?
$ENTITY Our game of hide-and-seek really kept me on my toes , ... You should get a gift for playing that well . I 'll be sure to mail you something soon , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY , huh ? ... It 's a nice touch for this place ! $ENTITY It makes this house seem a little bit like a museum , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh no , $ENTITY was I sleeping ? ... I guess all my late-night reading finally caught up with me .
$ENTITY Ho ho ! $ENTITY Do n't be shy ! $ENTITY Feel free to stare all you want !
$ENTITY Hey , ... Funny running into you here , ... !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's kind of fun to watch you in your natural habitat , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Just look at them go ! $ENTITY I 'm gon na try to keep track of how many fireworks go off tonight !
$ENTITY You sure picked a great day to visit ... We 're celebrating food during our $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ! $ENTITY The more the merrier . $ENTITY That 's what I always say for events like this . $ENTITY Or is it `` $ENTITY `` that I always say ? ... I ca n't remember ...
$ENTITY I wonder if it 'll clear up later . $ENTITY Or is it going to rain ? ... This wishy-washy weather is stressing me out !
$ENTITY I 'm gon na have to take a pass . $ENTITY I want to win , but not $ENTITY THAT bad !
$ENTITY Hey , what 's up , ... What are you doing out this early ? ... I mean ... is it not really early ? $ENTITY It 's dark , but today 's $ENTITY Winter Solstice ... I think it 's going to be like this all day , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I feel so rejuvenated ! $ENTITY Dancing here really helps to clear my mind .
$ENTITY I really like how $ENTITY 's $ENTITY moves ... . It 's almost ... hypnotic .
$ENTITY You need $ENTITY signatures $ENTITY from $ENTITY other towns $ENTITY . But you should get only signatures from $ENTITY bears $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oho ! $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Good to see you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey there . $ENTITY I 'm looking to offload my $ENTITY for $ENTITY Bells ... Any interest ? $ENTITY I 'm pretty sure the two of you were meant to be together ... ... Yes , please ! No way !
$ENTITY I did it ! $ENTITY I focused on my goal and worked hard all day . $ENTITY I 'm so happy , ... !
$ENTITY Yar ... It 's good to be young ! Ya wee minnows ought ta stay that way ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Tut tut ! ... Au contraire , mon frre ! ... , are you still saying such silly things ? $ENTITY Being a foodie is about adventure ! $ENTITY Is being a coward how you want to be known and remembered ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY I just do n't feel like exercising at all today , $ENTITY .
should polish my skills more $ENTITY so everyone will enjoy my fun prank again next year too !
$ENTITY My favorite type of coffee here is the ... lue Mountain $ENTITY roast . $ENTITY It makes me feel like I 'm on top of the world .
... . Oh , Canada ! ... Yes ! $ENTITY That 's the place ! $ENTITY I 'm sure I was headed to Canada ! $ENTITY I 'm amazed you actually guessed it . $ENTITY You 're really good at this whole saving-people thing , are n't you ? $ENTITY Thank you for everything you 've done for me ! $ENTITY I feel so much better about my trip now !
If I take good care of my bug , $ENTITY do you think someday it will come $ENTITY when I call it ? $ENTITY Here , $ENTITY Skippy !
$ENTITY has a really big bed ! ... She probably bounces around it and practices her dance moves . $ENTITY Yeah , I bet this bed is like $ENTITY 's stage !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I can always find a good deal here . $ENTITY It 's my favorite place to shop .
$ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY you 're probably right ! $ENTITY Sorry for bugging you ! ... Keep up the good work then ! ... !
$ENTITY Poses ... I 've never thought about it before ! ... Gim me some advice !
... this room is SO you !
$ENTITY
'm so sorry , but only citizens from this town can put items up in the flea-market space . $ENTITY You can still shop or sell me things , though , so please feel free to ask for my help in those matters !
Since you just got here , $ENTITY you do n't have a place to live yet , right ? $ENTITY You should go to $ENTITY Nook 's Homes ... on Main Street ... . Tom Nook $ENTITY will find a house for you , ... .
$ENTITY Signature ? $ENTITY What 's this all about ... . WHAT ? ! You want a club built on Main Street ? $ENTITY Of course I support that ! I 'll totally sign that thing , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Heeheehee ! I wonder how you 'd like to change ! $ENTITY Let me hear all about the image of who you want to be !
$ENTITY Yeah ! $ENTITY Maybe one day it 'll come true , ... .
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , keep thinking of catchphrases for me , OK ? I 'm sure I 'll ask you again someday !
$ENTITY OK. $ENTITY I understand . $ENTITY I 'll just look for one on my own .
second way to exercise your mayoral power is by starting $ENTITY public works projects $ENTITY . $ENTITY Public works projects add buildings and features to ... I 've already taken the liberty of putting together a list of requests from the town citizens ... . $ENTITY If there 's a request that really speaks to you , $ENTITY please select it to begin development !
$ENTITY It smells like $ENTITY and roses ... .
$ENTITY Awesome . $ENTITY That 'll be really helpful , ... Could you go get signatures from $ENTITY people $ENTITY living in other towns ? $ENTITY This time , $ENTITY people who look like rabbits ... And have them sign on this paper right here !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Wow ! ... Where did you run off to ? $ENTITY Why did you leave us behind ? ! $ENTITY You 're the heart and soul of $ENTITY after all ... . Please do n't leave us again .
$ENTITY Huh ? You want to make ... Wow ... Look at you go ! $ENTITY You should put in some honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY ! $ENTITY That 'll really mellow it out for you ! $ENTITY !
How long is this snow going to last , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I usually do n't cook ... But $ENTITY it 's the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY today ! $ENTITY I got ta show everyone what I 'm capable of in the kitchen ! $ENTITY Should n't you be cooking , too ? $ENTITY I 've been thinking of cooking ...
$ENTITY Thanks , ... You 're a total lifesaver !
$ENTITY It 's already very late , $ENTITY so you can do it in the morning ...
$ENTITY I had no idea he would give me something like this ... I guess he 's grown up a bit ?
$ENTITY Oh , yeah ? $ENTITY You think cities have the best food ? $ENTITY You might be right . $ENTITY I heard that skyscraper windows are actually made of jelly . That 's why they bend without breaking .
$ENTITY Was $ENTITY really part of the $ENTITY generation ? $ENTITY Oh ! Do n't tell her I was asking about that ! $ENTITY She gets mad when people figure out her age !
$ENTITY
eek ! You have no friends registered $ENTITY in your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS $ENTITY riend list $ENTITY . You need to register friends in order to visit faraway towns !
$ENTITY Thanks a bunch ! $ENTITY You really should n't have ! ... !
ENTITY You know the thing about you ... ? $ENTITY You 've got an eye for ingredients ! $ENTITY So what do you say ? $ENTITY I 'm planning to whip up a soup next ... How about if you just stick with me today as my ingredient-procurement assistant ? Gobble gob ! $ENTITY If the two of us put our talents together , $ENTITY the people of $ENTITY are in for the tastiest festival ever ! $ENTITY We 'd make a heck of a good team ! ... I 've got a really great feeling about this team-up ! $ENTITY OK then , I need ... . ... , $ENTITY and ... . $ENTITY Good ? $ENTITY Great ! Gobble gobble ! $ENTITY Also , if you would n't mind , bring me a $ENTITY secret ingredient ... OK ? That way , together we can make the best ... this town has ever seen !
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Heya , ... Are you doing some shopping , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Maybe I do n't need this item . $ENTITY Sometimes I surprise myself . I almost fell for the cheap price ! That was close . Too close !
$ENTITY Hmm ? ! $ENTITY You new here ... What was that ? ! $ENTITY But it 's been so long since I moved here to ... I can barely remember good ol ' ... That 's where I was living before moving here . $ENTITY I 'm shocked to find out there are still townsfolk I have n't met yet ! $ENTITY The name 's ... Do n't be a stranger now , $ENTITY you hear ? ... !
$ENTITY Gulliver $ENTITY the seagull is passed out on the beach ! $ENTITY You 'd better go wake him up , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY When I visited your house , $ENTITY I got the sense this would match the theme you had going ! ... I hope I was right !
$ENTITY Why hello ! Lovely to see you ! $ENTITY What do you think of my place ? !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY You did n't forget , did you ? I 'm hoping you can find me some $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY . Any kind is fine .
$ENTITY It 's pretty exciting when you pull a big prank ! $ENTITY It 's not a feeling you can get every day ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY You opened this ? ! ... What $ENTITY were you thinking ? !
$ENTITY Thanks , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Whoa , I 'm really liking that look you 've got going there ... Just wearing something like that $ENTITY brings out a whole new side of you !
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems you now know all there is to know about the lives of bugs . Master of insects ! ... You look like you 're beaming with pride as you walk around with that fine bug encyclopedia of yours !
$ENTITY So are we about done here ? $ENTITY I think the three of us are a little closer now , do n't you , ... I guess I 'll be heading out now ! Not a good idea to dillydally ! $ENTITY Adios !
$ENTITY You said $ENTITY wants to see me ? $ENTITY # xE ; But wait ... . When was this again ? $ENTITY It 'd be too late if I went now ! $ENTITY Maybe you should go and apologize for taking so long ? ... !
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Are my eyes playing tricks ? That ... When you keep an insect inside your house , you got ta make sure you leave it inside a cage ... If it escapes , I might freak out and accidentally squash it ! ... GAHAHA ! ... No seriously .
$ENTITY Oh ? $ENTITY Are you from around here ? ... Good to meet ya ! I 'm ... I just moved here recently . $ENTITY I used to live in $ENTITY , but $ENTITY persuaded me to move to this town . $ENTITY Umm ... what 's your name ? $ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY So you 're $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Huh , I guess I 've improved a little ... . I do feel more confident ! $ENTITY Let 's play hide-and-seek again if we get a chance ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY Oh , really ? ... Well , good-bye then . $ENTITY Come see me again !
$ENTITY Oh ! You 're watering flowers with a watering can ? $ENTITY Watering cans full of water are actually really heavy . Your efforts on behalf of flowers ... Wow ! I 'm so moved ! $ENTITY !
I got a clam ! $ENTITY Anyone for chowder ? ... in . $ENTITY

$ENTITY I should be more like $ENTITY and keep my place company-ready at all times !
This $ENTITY is for two people , $ENTITY but she likes to sit down right in the middle of it ! $ENTITY Apparently that sense of entitlement is important to her .
're having a store-closing sale today , so we apologize if any items are sold out ! $ENTITY All gone ! $ENTITY
looks something like this . $ENTITY So then , what do you think ? $ENTITY I 'll buy it ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY It 's nice to throw kitchen equipment into the mix , $ENTITY do n't you think ? That 's what I do , anyway .
$ENTITY I was just thinking that I needed to come say good-bye to you ! $ENTITY After all , $ENTITY it was really kind of you to give me advice about moving . $ENTITY We wo n't be living in the same town anymore , but I hope you never forget me !
$ENTITY You can get signatures from $ENTITY any girl in another town $ENTITY . $ENTITY I just need ... more ! $ENTITY Go get 'em , tiger !
... Oh my ! $ENTITY I get the feeling $ENTITY this coffee is a bit off from what I normally drink ! $ENTITY Who would think that changing the amount of $ENTITY milk $ENTITY and the type of $ENTITY beans $ENTITY would affect it so much ... it 's still nice !
I WAS feeling horrible , $ENTITY but I 'm starting to feel a little better now . $ENTITY It 's all thanks to the $ENTITY medicine ... gave me .

$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's really classy to have bonsai in your house . $ENTITY You ca n't just dabble half-heartedly in something like this ! $ENTITY must be taking really good care of it , $ENTITY !

It all falls under this theme . $ENTITY You 're up for it , right ? The $ENTITY Harmonious $ENTITY theme challenge ? Good to go ? $ENTITY Sign me up ! I 'll try something else .
$ENTITY I 'm totally not catching bugs today , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I 'm trying to catch the latest gossip , $ENTITY ! Because I 've heard someone 's spreading a rumor that I 'm totally bad at $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I have n't caught anyone repeating it around town . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY besides me !

Well , the calculation is complicated , so I ca n't come up with it just now . $ENTITY I 'll tell you the total later . $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY I 'm sure you 're very busy , since you just moved here ... Once you 've taken care of other things , stop by my store again to get the bill , hm ? ... Ah , but I suppose you still need a place to rest your head , right ? ... Give me just a moment ...

Since my twin sister and I both got jobs at the same time , we figured it 'd save Bells to share a home . It 's close to where we both work , $ENTITY so at first we thought it sounded completely perfect ... . But we 're both so busy with work that we rarely see each other at home . Is n't that ironic ? $ENTITY Still , we sometimes run into each other in the middle of the day , so we 're not totally separate !
$ENTITY I hope Orihime and Hikoboshi $ENTITY got to meet this year !
If you can find all of them within $ENTITY minutes $ENTITY , $ENTITY you 'll get some shiny medals !

$ENTITY Is it for ... Or is it to win a great big medal ? ... Hah ha !
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems you 've mastered the art of diving for creatures of the deep ... .

$ENTITY Uh-uh . $ENTITY Nope . $ENTITY You guessed wrong ! ... This is n't my house . $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY 's house ! $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY let 's go to my house for real this time !

$ENTITY I do n't mind rainy days too much . $ENTITY They give me a good excuse to bust out my cool umbrella !
$ENTITY # xE ; Well , ... YOU do n't hug a stuffed animal while sleeping , $ENTITY so that 's different , do n't you think ? $ENTITY Do n't go assuming too much . $ENTITY # xE ;

Emperor butterflies are easily recognized because of their lovely , iridescent blue wings . Pigmentation is n't actually what causes the color , but rather the reflections on their wing scales . Since their wings shimmer when moving , noticing them is much easier when they are midflight .

$ENTITY Geez , $ENTITY . Do n't look so worried ... It 's really not a big deal ! $ENTITY I just have this ... thing . $ENTITY And I do n't remember where it came from ... . Did I maybe borrow it from you ?
$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY what do you think you 're doing ? $ENTITY I do n't accept Bells as a birthday present . $ENTITY Sure , $ENTITY I could buy something I like with those Bells , $ENTITY but that 's not the point . $ENTITY You 're going to have to do better than that , ... .
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY What 's shaking , $ENTITY ?
Wow . So this might just be a rumor or whatever , but I heard $ENTITY is thinking about moving . $ENTITY Hmmm ... It does n't really seem like something $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY do , ya know ? $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY I bet $ENTITY talks to his $ENTITY all the time ! $ENTITY Not to help the plant grow ... $ENTITY but just so he can hear the sound $ENTITY of his own voice , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY But do n't worry ! $ENTITY I 'll take $ENTITY such good care of it . $ENTITY And it 'll always remind me $ENTITY of this amazing camping trip !
$ENTITY Well , I guess I 'll just have to apologize too then . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Things are a little hectic right now , but I think I can use this !
$ENTITY What ? You lost the capsule ? $ENTITY But ... . ! How awful . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I read a recent article about the importance of a balanced diet on your overall health . $ENTITY Some fresh $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY would help balance out all the $ENTITY I 've been eating lately . $ENTITY Sorry to be a bother , but could you bring me a piece of $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY if you find one ? $ENTITY Any kind is fine . $ENTITY Sure . Sorry , no .
$ENTITY Heh heh heh . $ENTITY I guess $ENTITY has a pretty nice fashion sense after all ! $ENTITY At the very least , she knows the type of clothes that make me look $ENTITY absolutely amazing .
Do n't skip lunch . Ever . ''
$ENTITY Where have you guys been ? You 're so late , $ENTITY I thought you 'd forgotten all about me ... .
$ENTITY Yeah ... I really should n't expect other people to do my dirty work for me . $ENTITY I 've been super stressed about that present from before . $ENTITY I 've decided I should deliver it myself , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY I totally did ! I $ENTITY wrote you a letter and everything . $ENTITY It had a bunch of musical-note stickers ! $ENTITY I was thinking that I 'd be the lead singer and you could sing backup , $ENTITY . $ENTITY And $ENTITY could be our token $ENTITY `` cute guy '' ! You know , so we 'll get lots of girl fans ! $ENTITY Whaddya think ? $ENTITY That sounds awesome ! Not my cup of tea .
Have you heard ? $ENTITY My ladies ' line has stylish items that can be worn by both the ladies and the gents . Why should girls get to have all the fun ? $ENTITY Swing by my boutique and we 'll outfit you up , honey .
$ENTITY To celebrate $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY , I prepared $ENTITY songpyeon $ENTITY for everyone ... . Would you like some ?
$ENTITY Does that mean your first coffee was at $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's ? $ENTITY You 're lucky ! $ENTITY This place has pretty great coffee , so you probably wo n't like it anywhere else , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY We 're all here to celebrate your birthday , ... Course , since it 's not a leap year , $ENTITY we 're doing things a day early . $ENTITY OK , make a wish , $ENTITY and blow out the candles !
$ENTITY Yay ! That is SO off the leash ! $ENTITY You 'll need to chase down $ENTITY signatures $ENTITY from $ENTITY other towns ... Oh , I almost forgot ! They all have to come from $ENTITY dogs $ENTITY . $ENTITY Yeah , who else would sign , right ? Here 's the sheet .
After looking in there , his personality really makes sense .
am called $ENTITY Saharah $ENTITY , for that is my name . I come from far away . $ENTITY Maybe I change your carpet . Wallpaper too . $ENTITY It is $ENTITY 3,000 Bells $ENTITY for deal , $ENTITY but ... $ENTITY ah . $ENTITY Your home $ENTITY is a tent ... This is no good for me . Very no good . I can not help your tent . So sorry now . $ENTITY Let us talk later , perhaps . When your house is bigger . Yes , OK .
$ENTITY Yo , $ENTITY we meet again ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY wants to see me , ... And ... # x0 ; just assumed I 'd be available at the drop of a hat . Well ! ... Now I 'm curious . $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY
It 's kind of weird to keep ... out in the open like this . $ENTITY Oh well . $ENTITY I guess everyone has different tastes , ... .
hearts on February 14th ... during the day of Valentine ... They beat so quickly and seem so hopeful $ENTITY for a returned beat , but ... . it seems they beat alone ... .
$ENTITY Hey , ... you can just have this for free . $ENTITY Do you want it ? $ENTITY I want it ! I do n't want it .
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY You just decided to open it yourself ? $ENTITY What were you thinking ? ! $ENTITY You are really making me look bad here , $ENTITY # x0 ; o $ENTITY # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; . $ENTITY .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Those calves of yours are really shaping up ! ... You 've been training hard , have n't you ? $ENTITY You deserve a reward . $ENTITY I 'm thinkin ' ... Just do n't ask me where I get this stuff !
ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY I 'll pay good money for ... of these , but you 'll have to pay a fee for me to take ... of them away ... .
$ENTITY Do n't bottle up your feelings . It 's bad for you , maaan ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , I suppose this really is $ENTITY 's room after all ... I 'm not the least bit surprised ! $ENTITY It 's not so strange to find something like $ENTITY just laying around ! ...
... This is amazing ! $ENTITY You 're a cracking barista ! Thanks !
$ENTITY , you 've been working so hard that I want to give you a nice reward to show my recognition . Come and get it from me before it gets dark out , OK ?
I hope $ENTITY does n't expect us to clean with the $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY hello ! $ENTITY We finally get a chance to meet . $ENTITY I suppose it has n't been TOO long since I moved to $ENTITY . $ENTITY I 'm almost used to living here now ... . Oh no !

Can I have some coffee ? With only $ENTITY 1 $ENTITY sugar , please !
$ENTITY The $ENTITY is one big bed ... . says he jumps on it to strengthen his legs ! I hope he does n't break it , ... .
Use that $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY you 're holding to dig up the items . $ENTITY You ca n't drop an item once you 've dug it up , so you 'll need to rebury it if you want to get rid of it .
I 'm going to make some gestures and give some clues , so try to guess what I 'm hinting at ! $ENTITY Watch carefully so you can guess what I 'm trying to describe ! $ENTITY Are you ready ?
$ENTITY Being born on February 29th $ENTITY is just the coolest ! ... I mean , you only get one birthday every 4 years . There 's no 29th this year , $ENTITY but hang in there , $ENTITY .
Oh , you think so ? $ENTITY Well , if you say so , maybe I should listen to you .
Better check the price tag before you pay , ... . $ENTITY Some items seem to have an extra 0 or two ...
$ENTITY Concerts totally get my hamster blood pumping ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Aha ! $ENTITY It really was ... You 're really smart ! ... Guess I 'll give you a prize !
$ENTITY Really ? So you 're just a hair away from being the best , right ? $ENTITY Man , I can totally see some interesting matchups developing ...

$ENTITY You want to see my dance moves ? $ENTITY Why ? $ENTITY So you can copy them ? $ENTITY Sorry , $ENTITY sister . $ENTITY You 'll have to wait .
$ENTITY What did $ENTITY think , ... Here 's the scoop ... I do n't remember .
$ENTITY It 's got ta be something that stands outsomething that sends chills up the spines of everyone who sees it ! $ENTITY A dark-purple tank top with a fierce dragon stitched on the back ... That would probably do the trick . $ENTITY The important thing is that it makes you look super cool and tough !
$ENTITY Can we please just ... end this game already ?
$ENTITY You 're all settled in now , $ENTITY are n't you , ... Well , $ENTITY now comes the real question ... . How do you want to decorate ? ... Because whether you 're in a tent or a mansion , $ENTITY you have options . $ENTITY Go see $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY on $ENTITY Main Street $ENTITY for all kinds of furniture and other knickknacks . $ENTITY And if you want to upgrade the look of your homeor make it bigger ... Nook 's Homes $ENTITY is the place to visit .

$ENTITY Hmmmm ... So it 's supposed to be like this ?
$ENTITY Well , you 're just being honest , I guess . $ENTITY You know , $ENTITY I think I 'll keep wearing it , $ENTITY . It IS a present , after all .
$ENTITY What ? But this is exactly what I 'm trying to replace ! $ENTITY Maybe I did n't explain myself well . $ENTITY I want to get rid of that old $ENTITY on my wall . I need something new to put in its place . $ENTITY Sorry , ... .

$ENTITY You would n't know it , but ... actually likes flowers ! $ENTITY I saw it with my own eyes ! She was out there tenderly watering flowers with a watering can ... I like that she 's got some surprises ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY You like that one there , do ya ? ... Well , $ENTITY I guess anybody would like that $ENTITY , huh ? But sorry , friend . Items are limited to one per customer per visit , $ENTITY so you 're just outta luck for the day .

$ENTITY Hard to tell now , $ENTITY but the sun never showed up today . I 'd say it was a slacker , $ENTITY ... Except that I think it was just on vacation . $ENTITY Yeah , the sun deserves a day off once a year , $ENTITY .

Do you $ENTITY have a $ENTITY favorite phrase $ENTITY you hold near and dear ? ... For me , it 's ...

Salmon are popular migratory fish that are born in rivers , migrate to oceans , and return in four years . In Japan , flavored salmon eggs are a very popular dish called ikura , but it has n't caught on in the US . In rare cases , salmon will only stay in the ocean for one or two years before coming back . These fish are known as `` phantom salmon '' since they 're so hard to find in the wild . Their characteristic pink color comes from the shrimp and krill they get in their diet . If they ate differently , their flesh would be white .

With a name that literally means `` ruler turtle , '' the archelon was an ancient species of sea turtle . Reaching 13 feet in length and two metric tons in weight , it was a giant that lived up to its name . It likely ate jellyfish and squid , though theories say it may have also preyed on ammonites . Unlike with modern turtles , its shell was too soft to allow it to pull in its limbs for a defensive position .

Sometimes they even bring me treats , so I 'm always so grateful for their continued support . When I tell them one of my old jokes and they smile , $ENTITY it takes me back to my days as a comedian . $ENTITY Heh . I ... do n't get a chance to look back fondly very often ... .
ENTITY Oh , hey ! ... It 's a $ENTITY grand-prize ticket ... That 's amazing ! $ENTITY Congratulations ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY

$ENTITY Did you know that $ENTITY is thinking about leaving town ? $ENTITY I do n't think $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; made up $ENTITY mind yet , $ENTITY so if you want to try to talk ... # x0 ; $ENTITY out of it , $ENTITY now 's your chance .
If you two can gather up ... at least ... points $ENTITY ' worth of ore , you 'll be rewarded with medals !

Sea horses do n't look like fish , but they still share a lot of distinct connections . They use their small dorsal fins and tail fins to swim , but in actuality they 're pretty bad swimmers . They wrap their tail fins around seaweed or coral so they wo n't float away with the current . Once attached , they feed on plankton and small shrimp that float by . The female deposits eggs in the male 's pouch , putting the burden of child care on the male .
$ENTITY I 'll try this on later when I have a little privacy . $ENTITY Show me now ! OK .
Get extra Bells today if you sell the following : $ENTITY

$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY No way ! $ENTITY I let $ENTITY borrow my $ENTITY about a million years ago !
$ENTITY That $ENTITY is pretty comfy . You should try it !

$ENTITY

$ENTITY What do you like most in people , ... Style , of course ! Personality . The little things . Whatever ...
ENTITY Mmm ... . ? !
$ENTITY Well , let 's see ... There seems to be $ENTITY on the other side that 's in the way . As a result , it might be difficult to place a bridge right here ... .
$ENTITY Come on in , ... !
And that 's the truth !
$ENTITY How about $ENTITY a cup of coffee ? $ENTITY I 'd like a $ENTITY regular $ENTITY amount of milk with that , please !
$ENTITY Cool ! $ENTITY I figured you 'd know a good deal when you saw one ... . Thanks , $ENTITY !

Any kind of $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY would be OK , ... Sure . Not right now .
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY You do n't know ?
ENTITY Oh ... Are you my princess ? ... Kiss me and wake me from my endless slumber ! $ENTITY Hey , wait a sec ! $ENTITY Just who are you ? ! You do n't look like no princess ! $ENTITY I 'm $ENTITY Gulliver ... just a humble little sailor of some note around the seven or eight seas . $ENTITY Wait ? $ENTITY Could it be that YOU were the one who saved me ? $ENTITY Oh my gosh ! $ENTITY What have I done ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe I was so rude to my rescuer ! $ENTITY Find it in your heart to forgive me ! $ENTITY That 's what heroes do ! $ENTITY Huh , I 'm actually very confused at this exact moment ... . I guess I went overboard and was tossed into the sea . $ENTITY Gah , $ENTITY typical . $ENTITY Probably my fault for dozing off on the side of a ship in the middle of the BIGGEST storm ever . $ENTITY I do n't have a single memory of what happened after that . $ENTITY Sea amnesia , they call it . $ENTITY Come to think of it , $ENTITY I 'm pretty sure I was on my way to someplace or another , since , $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY I 'm a sailor . Hmmm . Where was I headed ... ? If I could at least remember the name of the silly place ... .
$ENTITY OK , be honest ... Have you had some special hide-and-seek training ? $ENTITY Take this prize anyway !

Sea cucumbers are similar to sea urchins and sea stars but are far more slender and softer . When threatened by a predator , they expel part of their internal organs as a natural defense . This is to blind and entangle the enemy so the sea cucumber has a window of escape . Some types of sea cucumbers allow predators to feed on their internal organs while they escape . Do n't shed a tear for them , though , as the internal organs grow back after a while .

The house centipede has many remarkably long legs that give it a very intimidating appearance . However , despite this intense look , they are for the most part harmless to humans . When an enemy is holding down one of its legs , the house centipede will drop that leg to make an escape . The dropped leg will continue to flail for a while , though , providing a distraction .

These relatives of common turtles will not let go when they decide to bite down on something . Although they can be quite shy , they will become a bit aggressive when threatened . They are often found in water and are very good swimmers because of the flat shape of their shells . They swim with their snouts over the surface of the water so they can breathe . Soft-shelled turtles are n't safe to hold because they are so prone to biting at the slightest movement . However , if one bites down on you , it will usually let go when you put it safely back in the water .

Since you 're carrying a shovel , $ENTITY I 'll give you some pointers on raising fruit trees ! $ENTITY First , use your shovel to dig a hole where you 'd like to plant your tree . $ENTITY Then , $ENTITY select the fruit you want to plant from your pockets and choose $ENTITY Bury $ENTITY . $ENTITY It 's quite simple ! ... However , there are things you can do to make sure your tree grows nice and strong . For example , where you plant it will make a huge difference ... Somewhere like in the shadow of a building or too close to another tree or next to a river or next to a cliff ... If you plant in places like those , the tree wo n't grow up strong . $ENTITY It 'll just end up wilting ! $ENTITY So when you choose a place to plant a tree , $ENTITY make sure you give it plenty of space to grow !
$ENTITY Someone asked me if $ENTITY was my total BFF , $ENTITY but I think we 're more like FFFAW . $ENTITY You know , Fine Friends for a While . We like to have tea parties $ENTITY and go dancing !

King salmon grow to about twice the size of regular salmon , which really helps them embody the name . This size essentially makes them the actual kings of salmon , though they are also called chinook salmon . In some regions , they return to the river in spring or summer and live there until spawning in the fall . In rare cases , king salmons ' meat will be white , but these are not as popular since pink is the standard .
Surprised to see me fishing ? $ENTITY I like to keep people on their toes ... . !
$ENTITY Now do n't worry , $ENTITY I 'm not here $ENTITY to read ya the riot act about not saving . Yer off the hook today ! Naw , I 'm here to thank ya !

Sweetfish are migratory fish born upstream that travel to the ocean and then return to rivers to spawn . This migratory mind-set is what emphasizes their similarity to salmon . Adult sweetfish have a watermelon- like mossy smell when caught , since they eat moss on riverbed rocks . Sweetfish are very territorial and will attack rivals that encroach on their territory . Anglers use this combative nature against them by using lures made of other sweetfish .
$ENTITY It 's ... I hope you 'll help me with more petitions in the future , $ENTITY . I mean , if we can drum up attention for ... Who knows what else we can accomplish , $ENTITY ?
Robust cicadas are distinguished by the shortness of their bodies in relation to their wing size . They used to share territories with brown cicadas , but robust cicadas tend to prefer dry locales . As you 'd expect , they make a rather robust call , though males actually change their sound around females .
The larvae of tiger butterflies feed on leaves of orange trees until they metamorphose . When they 're threatened , they emit a foul smell from their antennae to protect themselves . The dusting you see on your fingers whenever you touch their wings is actually from their scales . These scales form the wing pattern as well as repel rainwater , making them very important for survival .

Now sea stars $ENTITY people say you should n't eat these guys . Not tasty , apparently ! Quite a harsh critique ! ... Yeah , $ENTITY I think I 'll listen to common opinion just this once . I 'm not quite crazy enough to eat a sea star !
$ENTITY Aha ! ... Total necessity these days . $ENTITY I saw this commercial for a luxury fridge on TV the other day ... You know the one I 'm talking about ? $ENTITY It 's the one about the fridge that adds flavors to food . $ENTITY I love crazy stuff like that ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY I 'm excited to see how much your place changed since the last time I was there , $ENTITY !
To be honest , I 'm bored of th ... in my room . $ENTITY Totally out of style and dull . $ENTITY So I 'm looking for replacement furniture . $ENTITY Do you maybe have any suggestions for things I should buy ? $ENTITY something that happens to be the exact same size as the $ENTITY ?
... We meet again ! $ENTITY I thought I 'd be seeing a lot of you today ! ... Maybe 'cause of the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY ? $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Pies made with lots of $ENTITY different fruit $ENTITY are great 'cause they have tons of different flavors going on . $ENTITY The trick to making them even better ... is squeezing a bit of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on top ! $ENTITY Adding a little bit of sourness to something sweet balances things out and really improves the flavor . $ENTITY Sigh ... I wan na eat some right now !
$ENTITY It 's a book that was recommended in Chic $ENTITY Monthly . All the smart girls are reading it !

$ENTITY Mmm , when it 's this sunny , it 's like the sky is giving me a big hug , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY As am I ! $ENTITY I thought you would put a little more thought into it ! ... This is a serious discussion , after all !

I mean , $ENTITY I 'd like to , $ENTITY but there are n't a lot of story ideas to be found in my ordinary life ... I 'll have to start by making my life more exciting , ... .
$ENTITY Hey , ... What 's the dealio ? $ENTITY You bailed on me big time . $ENTITY You said you 'd come over ! $ENTITY I waited ... but no $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You should be a little more considerate next time . $ENTITY Trust me , $ENTITY you do NOT want to make ... angry !
Well , after the show aired , $ENTITY I was recognized everywhere I went . It was fun at first ... But then it got really annoying ! $ENTITY I could n't go anywhere without signing a cheesy picture of myself . So $ENTITY I totally reinvented myself ... . New hairstyle and everything . $ENTITY Life 's been grand ever since ! $ENTITY Now I just sing in the shower . $ENTITY And I still sound fabulous !
$ENTITY Oh , bums ! $ENTITY I was trying to remember something , $ENTITY but it 's gone . Like , $ENTITY poof ! There goes my thought ! Sorry , but I need to concentrate $ENTITY for a while $ENTITY and try to re-remember $ENTITY that thing I was trying to remember ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ever wonder what it 'd be like to hang out with a dinosaur ? $ENTITY We could probably go through a whole mountain of $ENTITY together !
$ENTITY You 'll need a total of $ENTITY signatures $ENTITY from $ENTITY rabbits in other towns $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Good morning , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Welcome to the $ENTITY Winter Solstice ... That 's why it 's so dark out . It feels kinda weird saying good morning , don'tcha think ? $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What 's all this about , ... Why did you call me here ?
$ENTITY It 's nice that you 're so polite , $ENTITY but you can still call me ... The first thing we should work on is the proper way to thank someone . $ENTITY Look him or her in the eyes , and say $ENTITY `` thank you very much '' $ENTITY in a warm tone of voice . $ENTITY Now you try it .
$ENTITY and $ENTITY ! Glad you could make it !
$ENTITY Oooohhh ... You monster ... .
$ENTITY Good morning , ... Today 's the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY , right ? $ENTITY That explains why it 's so dark . $ENTITY It feels like it 's the middle of the night , ... .
$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY you scared me ! ... I could n't believe it was you ! $ENTITY What happened to your face ? Are you OK ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY That cat who was impersonating me did a pretty amazing job . $ENTITY If I see her again , $ENTITY maybe I can get her to share some of her secrets with me , ... .
$ENTITY Huh ? ... Ah , I get it ! This is your town , huh ? $ENTITY I 'm $ENTITY ! Do you remember meeting me ? $ENTITY From now on , we 'll be good buddies living in the same town ! $ENTITY Actually ... we 're gon na be good rivals too !
I see ... That 's too bad ... . Well , that does n't make me happy , ... but I have too much dancing to do to stay sad !
$ENTITY I wonder what $ENTITY and $ENTITY would say about their relationship . $ENTITY They seem to spend a lot of time $ENTITY arguing with each other and then making up . $ENTITY That sort of thing would wear me out , ... .

ENTITY The ... ordinance is already active , $ENTITY so let 's keep beautifying $ENTITY !
ENTITY Hey , it 's $ENTITY Shamrock Day ... I have something for just this occasion , so come find me later to get it !
$ENTITY That hat is kind of rare , is n't it ? $ENTITY I heard you can only get it by playing outside during winter !
... . $ENTITY Ah , ummmmmm , ... he 's basically like $ENTITY a $ENTITY donations box ... I 'm sure I mentioned it to you before , but ... All of the construction costs for public works projects in $ENTITY are covered entirely by donations . $ENTITY Of course , you can chip in some of your own money too , Mayor ! $ENTITY Actually ... I get the feeling we wo n't be able to gather enough funds if you do n't help us out ... . Please do n't forget to donate !
Thanks for doin ' that , ... I hope things get patched up !
$ENTITY Do n't be a stranger , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey ... . You gon na stick it out till morning , $ENTITY ?

$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY You 'll really do it ? ! ... Now I 'm all excited ! ... !
$ENTITY You know , you 've got a certain odd charm to you , ... It 's like you 've got it all ... I bet you have no problem making friends , am I right , ... ?

$ENTITY We 're connected by a blue string ? $ENTITY What does that mean ? ... It must mean that our friendship is chill !
$ENTITY If you wear a special countdown hat $ENTITY you 'll have a good new year ! $ENTITY So you should hurry up and put one on , ... You can get one from $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Searching for ingredients was a lot harder than I thought it would be ! $ENTITY Good thing I 'm strong ! It took a lot of muscle , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yo ! Welcome ... Did you just get here ? $ENTITY Welcome to ... !
$ENTITY
Hmm ... Nope , that 's not quite what I was looking for . $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY this is the right $ENTITY amount of milk ... but everything else seems off . $ENTITY You 'll do better next time ! $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY I 'll see you later !

$ENTITY That $ENTITY like , so insanely adorable . $ENTITY I want to hug it forever , $ENTITY !

Sea butterflies go with the flow , as they 'll drift in cold winter waters along with ice floes .

$ENTITY I 'm glad you understand now ! ...
It 's ... I know I certainly did , ...

$ENTITY Do n't tell too many people , $ENTITY but I heard that $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY is in town today . $ENTITY He always has one or two really great bargains ... mixed in with some stuff of slightly inferior quality . $ENTITY So $ENTITY if you 're smart , $ENTITY there are deals to be had . $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY The siren song of the sale compels you !
$ENTITY You wo n't help me ? Well , I guess I 'll figure something else out .
$ENTITY So , $ENTITY , I want you to catch me $ENTITY . I know it 's going to be tricky .

to certain reasons , the business hours for today have been changed . Store owners
$ENTITY Please take it home with you as a memento of the $ENTITY countdown $ENTITY you spent with us here in $ENTITY .
Coelacanths are ancient fish once believed to be extinct but recently discovered around South Africa . Called `` living fossils , '' they have apparently changed very little over the past 400 million years . They can live for over 60 years and reach lengths of six feet but have rather small brains , even for fish . They have more fins and harder scales than the average fish , making them a rather resilient breed . Their flavor is very different from most fish , and they contain a fat that is indigestible by humans . It 's for that second reason that eating them really is n't highly recommended .
$ENTITY This place sure has changed a lot since I was last over ! $ENTITY Not that I remember what it looked like originally of course ... . GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
... . USA ! ... Yes ! Yes ! YES ! $ENTITY I was going to America ! $ENTITY That country has a very familiar scent to me .

Wait a minute ... $ENTITY Sure , being a Hollywood movie star would n't be so bad ... $ENTITY But now I 'm thinking Broadway is calling me to star in a musical ! $ENTITY So many choices ! $ENTITY U- $ENTITY S- ... !
$ENTITY Quality over quantity is always the way to go , unless it 's a buffet . Maaaan , it 's ALL quantity there . $ENTITY

$ENTITY
$ENTITY So you 're locked in with higher than 5 , huh ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY the number on the card is ... ! Hmmm . $ENTITY That 's another miss ! ... I guess that means you lost more than you won this game ... .

$ENTITY You here on a shopping run , ... That 's cool . $ENTITY Just do n't buy up $ENTITY everything in our store , ... !
$ENTITY It looks like I 'm sitting , right ? $ENTITY But actually I 'm holding my body off the stump by an inch or so . It 's training !
$ENTITY Hey , listen ! $ENTITY A rock laid an egg ! $ENTITY Well , technically I smashed a rock with a shovel and an egg appeared . $ENTITY I was like , `` Is this thing gon na hatch into a baby rock now or what ? ! '' $ENTITY ? !

I see . Please close your eyes then and let us return ... .
Many people think octopuses have eight legs , but those are not legs . Their tentacles are actually arms . They have a strange anatomy , with their head located between their body and arms . The flexible arms are perfect for catching all kinds of crab , shrimp , and shellfish , especially in reefs . When attacked by predators , octopuses emit a black ink that spreads through the water . This greatly reduces visibility and allows them to escape , making them highly skilled at disappearing .
$ENTITY You 're right . $ENTITY I 'll take the plunge , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY OK , ... Take a deep breath ... and blow out those candles !
$ENTITY I 'm glad to see you , $ENTITY ! You just made this party , like , a million times cooler !

Miyama stags look strong , with their thick , bumpy exoskeletons and yellow hair covering their bodies . They 're active during the day but really do n't prefer the heat during the summer . Contrary to their appearance , they are rather delicate insects , so be sure to handle with care .
For example , someone who 's put a lot of time into plucking weeds and making the town prettier ... .
You know , $ENTITY I 'm pretty good when it comes to scooping goldfish , $ENTITY if I do say so myself . And I do ... . OK ... Umm , $ENTITY hey , close your eyes for a second or two , would ya ? ... YUM !

$ENTITY
ENTITY With your help , $ENTITY I put together a pretty amazing soup ! $ENTITY The quality of all the ingredients you provided really made the dish ! $ENTITY But I have a feeling there 's a better secret ingredient out there to bring out the dish 's true potential . $ENTITY It may just be my pride as a chef talking , ... but I intend to one day find that real ultimate flavor ! $ENTITY Anyway , to thank you for helping me with the soup , $ENTITY I 'd like you to have this $ENTITY !
$ENTITY

Catfish are known for their long whiskers , wide bodies , and large mouths , but they do n't have fur . Despite having large eyes , they have rather poor eyesight . They make up for this with sensory whiskers . Catfish have small horizontal and vertical lines in their bodies , almost like perforated lines . These holes are for detecting weak electric currents of other fish , making them adept hunters . Catfish are artful carnivores as they swim around lazily but then strike quickly when prey is found .
$ENTITY You look just like a kiwi today , ... Your outfit is so sweet , ... !
$ENTITY
How do you like $ENTITY it here so far ? ...

$ENTITY What 's the deal with leaving so fast ? $ENTITY Is there a sale or something going on ? $ENTITY Well , whatever . $ENTITY We were pretty much done here anyway ... More importantly , thanks for all your help , ... I 'll have a thank-you gift sent to your house , OK ? $ENTITY So be sure to look out for it ! ... !
$ENTITY Do n't hang around forever ! $ENTITY Go on ! Get outta here !
Feel ... so ... heavy ... Can ... hardly ... move ... This cold is bad , dude ... You should stay away ! ...

$ENTITY Oh yeah ? $ENTITY You really think so ? ... Well then , what is it ?
$ENTITY You 've gone with the basics for a $ENTITY basic $ENTITY theme and it works ! $ENTITY If the outfit 's a bit bland , that 's not your fault . $ENTITY Sometimes in fashion , you 've got to keep it simple !
? What shall we talk about then ? & # xF ; $ENTITY Wet suit . Fishing rod . Net . Axe . Shovel . I changed my mind .
What kind of blend would you like ? $ENTITY It 's still $ENTITY 200 Bells ... even if you choose the takeout option ... I 'll leave it up to you ! Never mind .
There 's only one $ENTITY in $ENTITY who dreams of becoming $ENTITY ! So even if a faker appeared , $ENTITY it 'd be super easy to pick out the real $ENTITY !
ENTITY In second place ... With a delectable $ENTITY -inch ... , it 's ... ...

$ENTITY I 'm pretty sure next $ENTITY Bug-Off ... you 'll be the one up on that podium ! $ENTITY So please do n't feel too sad , ... !
$ENTITY Oh deary me ! ... Did I not give you the $ENTITY bureom $ENTITY yet ? $ENTITY Well then , here you go ! $ENTITY Bureom refers to tree nuts like $ENTITY walnuts and pine nuts . $ENTITY It 's just a fun little mixture here , but it 's only for decoration . $ENTITY Do n't try eating it , ... OK !
That 's too bad . $ENTITY But I dig , I dig ... .
$ENTITY You can see the fireworks from just about anywhere ! $ENTITY But if you 're gon na watch , $ENTITY might as well watch from a spot that makes for a nice picture , ... !
$ENTITY By the way , I do n't think I 've seen you around here . $ENTITY Who are you to be all up in my dream like this , $ENTITY ?
ENTITY OK ! So you want to sign the ... ordinance into law ... Let 's do it ! I changed my mind .
You did it ! Good job ! $ENTITY But do n't drop that net yet ! I 'll toss in some bonus medals if you catch more .
... Not like that ! $ENTITY That 's the exact same face $ENTITY just made !
$ENTITY Geesh , $ENTITY I 'm just trying to look out for you ... Fine ! Do what you want ! ...
$ENTITY Hmm ... I 'm partial to $ENTITY topping , $ENTITY myself ... . Especially when you warm it up a little . $ENTITY You 'll let me know next time you make some , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Promise me !
$ENTITY Turnips , $ENTITY eh ? $ENTITY I bet I could make a $ENTITY really yummy soup $ENTITY out of these little tubers ! $ENTITY Hmm ? $ENTITY That 's not what they 're for ? $ENTITY I 'm not sure what you mean by that , $ENTITY but I appreciate the gift !

$ENTITY Happy New Year ! $ENTITY Here 's to all the great times we 'll have together in the new year , $ENTITY !
... =
$ENTITY The moon is so pretty today . $ENTITY I feel like if you wished upon that moon , $ENTITY anything you could think of would come true !
you want to see me perform , $ENTITY just sneak in here during the afternoon sometime !
the way , the best entry so far ... It 's $ENTITY caught by $ENTITY that came in at ... inches $ENTITY ! Quite a catch !
$ENTITY Ah ! Oh no ! Was I just dreaming ? $ENTITY I did n't get enough sleep last night , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Sweet ! $ENTITY All right , let 's trade !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! ... I never dreamed I 'd run into you here ! ... !
$ENTITY There 's a new shop opening on Main Street that sells $ENTITY exclusively ! $ENTITY You can sit outside and enjoy $ENTITY to your heart 's content ! $ENTITY Whoa , cool ! I do n't believe you .
$ENTITY Pardon ? $ENTITY If that 's for the club , $ENTITY I think I 've already signed it ... . Here , $ENTITY I 'll sign it again just in case .
So that means ... you win !
$ENTITY Ha ha ! $ENTITY Is my place really all that appealing , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY For soup with $ENTITY clams $ENTITY in it , $ENTITY I really recommend adding some $ENTITY butter ... It makes your soup mild , yet rich . Clams and butter just go really well together ! ... ! $ENTITY They 're like a couple ... that 's been together forever !
You only live once , unless you have another guy . ( # 24 )
ENTITY G'morning !
$ENTITY The strawberry jam my mom would make for us ! $ENTITY I liked eating it on top of her freshly baked bread . $ENTITY Just thinking about it is making me wistful $ENTITY and hungry .

$ENTITY Ugh ... Medicine ... Dude ... that would be so helpful ...
$ENTITY Mmm . Smells like ... .
$ENTITY I wonder what $ENTITY uses that $ENTITY for ... . Probably weighing things , right ?
$ENTITY Oh , ... Well , $ENTITY that 's a little intimidating . $ENTITY You may be shocked to hear this , $ENTITY but professional wrestling is not one of my many interests .
$ENTITY Someone here in town has a total $ENTITY phobia ! $ENTITY Now who was it again ... ? $ENTITY That 's right ! $ENTITY It 's either $ENTITY or ... One of those two !
$ENTITY OK ! You gave me something yummy , so I 'm going to treat you in return ! $ENTITY Here you go ! $ENTITY It 's a very special $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Homes with the necessities ? Bonus points . A nod to thoroughness . Tip of the hat to completeness . Bang .
$ENTITY Please bring me ... signatures from $ENTITY frogs who live in other towns ... .
... Dude ! Come on ! $ENTITY I 'm joking ! $ENTITY I totally win at $ENTITY April Fools ' Day ...
In the short time since I 've stepped down as $ENTITY 's mayor , this town sure has changed a lot . $ENTITY I suppose that 's the point of having a new mayor , though . Change is n't always a bad thing , sprout !
$ENTITY Hey hey ! $ENTITY Thanks for braving the cold to come visit me ! $ENTITY What do you think of this town ? ... I think it 's pretty neat !
Prices are going up because of the ordinance you established , ... . Hopefully $ENTITY business will go well for the Able sisters as a result ...

$ENTITY # x4 ; Gracie $ENTITY never fails to impress me ! $ENTITY Her elegance is beyond all our expectations , ... !
$ENTITY

$ENTITY Ho ho ho ! $ENTITY It 's almost that time of year ! $ENTITY You ready ? $ENTITY Ahh ! I love this season ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait for $ENTITY Toy Day ... My party-animal blood is pumping ! $ENTITY !
Man , I had such a bad cold the other day , I nearly DIED . $ENTITY brought me some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY day after day , $ENTITY so without that , I 'd totally be gone right now . $ENTITY THAT is definitely ... what I 'd call a lifesaver ! ... !
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Oh ... it was a dream ! $ENTITY Phew ! $ENTITY Man , I do n't really wan na go back to sleep if my dreams are gon na be so weird ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You see , $ENTITY when I was a kid , I 'd often play hide-and-seek underneath the cherry trees . $ENTITY If the blossoms scattered , it 'd be really hard to find everyone ... As a kid , that was pretty scary !
$ENTITY Whoa ! You got them ALL for me ! ... Awesome ! $ENTITY I 'll take this and get everything going right away !
$ENTITY Thanks again for all your help . $ENTITY Hopefully I never get sick again , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY So I 'm pretty sure the outfit I 'm wearing falls under the $ENTITY look . $ENTITY You know , $ENTITY some `` modern '' pizzas have cheese IN the crust now ... That 's some out-of-the-box thinking right there !
$ENTITY Wow , $ENTITY you 've traveled such a long way ! Thank you for coming to celebrate with us today ! $ENTITY Today is $ENTITY Tree Day ... It 's also $ENTITY Bunny Day $ENTITY ! You certainly picked a fun day to visit $ENTITY , huh ?

Well , what do you know ? $ENTITY Why , I have n't been so insulted since $ENTITY said I had the fashion sense of $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Whew , I am so sleepy ! $ENTITY It 's definitely time for bed , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY It 's impossible to be in a bad mood when there 's snow on the ground and everything is this beautiful . $ENTITY Believe meI 've tried !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Heh heh . $ENTITY A double bed totally fits $ENTITY 's image ! ... I bet he owns it to make sure he has sweet dreams every night ! $ENTITY Now me , I 'd use it mostly because a double bed is $ENTITY easier to hide under when monsters attack ... . Naturally .
$ENTITY You serious ? ... No kidding ? $ENTITY Where 'd you get it ? $ENTITY This is great ! $ENTITY Thanks , ...
$ENTITY The $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY has come to an end ! ... I 'm looking forward to the awards ceremony ! Always a good show !

$ENTITY Do n't worry about me ! $ENTITY Just go ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I bet you think there 's nothing you could possibly do to make $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY taste any better ... $ENTITY But if you add a squeeze of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY juice right before serving , it 'll really brighten the palate . $ENTITY Deeeeelish !
$ENTITY OK ! ... I 'll be at your place at ... ! $ENTITY !
I got a sea anemone ! $ENTITY More like a sea ENEMY ! Look out ! ... in . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Your outfit ! Is there a basketball game today or something ? ! $ENTITY Someday I 'd like to lay down a spectacular , buzzer-beating dunk ! $ENTITY We should be practicing our dunking skills right now , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What the heck ? ! $ENTITY AUGH ! ... Please leave ! $ENTITY I 'll give you some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY if you just go , ... But it looks like your pockets are full ... ... What am I supposed to do now ?
$ENTITY Hello , hello ... Is it just me , or is it , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY totally freezing out ? !
$ENTITY Thanks to our brilliant mayor 's ordinance , it 's a lot easier and more pleasant to jog in this town . $ENTITY Weeds and garbage , the enemies of runners , are gone ! It 's a big help ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I want ... and ... treasuresand nothing else !

Hiya , $ENTITY . I 'm so glad you came to visit even though it 's raining , ... .
$ENTITY Once again , we 'll be pulling weeds $ENTITY and making the town look happy !

$ENTITY You 're in a better mood now ? ! ... Wow . Glad to hear it ... . !
Um . $ENTITY So you wo n't be helping me out ?

$ENTITY I 've been holding back a big tip until I was certain you 're the kind of girl I could trust . That is , trust not to take pictures of me that are unflattering ... . Now I 'm certain you wo n't do that . Press and hold to get your camera ready , $ENTITY and then press to snap the picture . $ENTITY Simple enough ! You can look at your pics in the $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS Camera $ENTITY application . $ENTITY Since I shared that secret , you would n't dare take a pic when I 'm having a bad-hair day . Right ?
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's so easy to relax when you listen to the right music !
$ENTITY Have you learned your lesson ? $ENTITY I 'm not scared of your silly hat ... . !
$ENTITY If you 've got something important to talk about with $ENTITY , just say the word ! I 'll cover my ears so I do n't hear anything , ... !

$ENTITY There might be things here that we should n't touch ! ... Make sure you check with $ENTITY first !
$ENTITY If you 're going to make a fish dish , the tang of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY is essential . Essential , $ENTITY # x0 ; o $ENTITY # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; ! $ENTITY But I 'm never sure which one to use in particular situations ... That 's where your kitchen-intuition muscles are tested , $ENTITY . I call that `` inkuitchen . ''

$ENTITY Hmm . What is it , I wonder ?
ENTITY Yes , yes ! $ENTITY You would like to discuss $ENTITY your home , hm ? $ENTITY I wan na expand ! Never mind .

$ENTITY Did you already go take a look at Mayor $ENTITY 's house ? $ENTITY It 's nice ! Real minimal .

I caught a sea bass ! See ? A bass ! ... in . $ENTITY

I reeeeeally want to ask $ENTITY about his ... But I do n't want to embarrass him . $ENTITY He probably just forgot to hide it away before we came over !
$ENTITY I was just about to turn in for the night and dry my soaked clothes ... . But then who 'd be here for you ?
$ENTITY No matter what you have planned for tonight , $ENTITY you should set aside some time for $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It 's a special day when we take a little time to appreciate the beauty of the full moon . $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Maybe we can spend some time moon gazing later on , ... !

$ENTITY I bet $ENTITY must be writing a blog or something , $ENTITY since she 's got that $ENTITY . $ENTITY They say you 're supposed to write what you know , $ENTITY so she must write about being all stylish and stuff !
$ENTITY Aha ! $ENTITY We meet again ! $ENTITY Heh ... Do you even remember me ? $ENTITY It 's ... I moved , just like I said I would ! $ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY on that camping trip I felt like you gave me a good preview of what life would be like here ... . Good to see ya again , $ENTITY !

Hey , $ENTITY . If this is a dream , $ENTITY why does it feel like a real place ? $ENTITY Probably because you 're here . $ENTITY Yup , you 're as real as it gets , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY out $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY head ? ... No , no . $ENTITY I just did n't understand you , that 's all . $ENTITY You said I 'm the cutest girl around ... In this town ... ... RIGHT , ... Absolutely ! Yeah , real cute ...
ENTITY Now then , let 's pick an eye color that accurately expresses your present feelings .
$ENTITY Uhh ... . Great .
$ENTITY The atmosphere of this place is strangely familiar to me . $ENTITY I get the feeling I 'd get along with the folks who live here too . $ENTITY You know , this town would n't be a bad place to settle down ... You should move here ! It 's kind of dull here .
$ENTITY Oh dear , I forgot ! $ENTITY There 's actually something else I need to tell you ... When inside your house , you can press to change the camera angle in the room . You can also use it to zoom and change your point of view ... . Did you already know that ? Oh , and if you press the $ENTITY switch $ENTITY on the lower screen , you can make the entire room lighter or darker . $ENTITY Since it 's your home , you should take time to enjoy it from each and every angle !
$ENTITY Hee hee ... Sorry about this ! $ENTITY But also thanks ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , ... ! As you can see , I 'm all moved in to ... It 's as nice as you said it would be ! $ENTITY Ugh . Cough . $ENTITY Unfortunately , $ENTITY I think the stress of moving has caused me to catch a cold . $ENTITY But I 'd love to spend some time together once I 'm well again .
$ENTITY Also $ENTITY I 'd like ... 3 spoonfuls $ENTITY of sugar , please .
$ENTITY By the way , I like my coffee $ENTITY with a $ENTITY # x0 ; regular $ENTITY amount of milk . $ENTITY Think you can handle that , ... ?
OK , OK ! $ENTITY No need to get bent out of shape ! $ENTITY I guess I 'll just forget it , ... .
Pike are only found in cold water , so they can not live in warmer parts of the world . They can grow over three feet long and as such are a very popular fish with anglers . Pike have a slightly protruding jaw and large mouths with sharp teeth , making them powerful predators . They use these teeth for tearing apart not only other fish but also birds and other aquatic creatures .
ENTITY Oh , how should I explain this ... When you make new designs , $ENTITY you do it on your $ENTITY custom designs $ENTITY screen , right ? $ENTITY When you do that , the front , back , and sleeves of the shirt will all have the same design ... But if you make pro designs , then the front , back , and sleeves can all be a bit different . You can make long sleeves or no sleeves , or even make new types of clothes , such as dresses ! $ENTITY It 's a fun way to make professional- style clothing without needing a ton of professional training ! Nice , huh ? ... What do you think ? Want to give it a try ? $ENTITY Yes , please ! Maybe next time .
$ENTITY This should work , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I never thought I 'd find a bargain quite like this ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY If you compare it to your own place , you 'll begin to realize that other people 's homes smell differently ... Oh ! ... I do n't mean that it stinks or anything like that ! ...
$ENTITY I think $ENTITY keeps this place pretty clean for someone as busy as she is .
$ENTITY It 's totally time to party tonight ! ... You should n't be acting all cool like you do n't need sleep , though ! Real cool people take naps , ... !
$ENTITY Maybe you like rainy nights ? ... They are pretty in their own ... unique way , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Morniiiing $ENTITY , ... Nice day , huh , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY it does n't hurt to try ! $ENTITY I just got it , so I might as well give it a go !
$ENTITY Really ? $ENTITY Guess you do n't need any help from me then , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What ? I think ... . yeah , I feel a little of my sparkle coming back . $ENTITY I hope it lasts ... .
$ENTITY No way ! Why would I let someone open the door for me $ENTITY when I can just do it myself ? $ENTITY Plus , $ENTITY opening doors is really good for hand-eye coordination . $ENTITY Maybe I 'm not cut out $ENTITY to be a girly girl !
$ENTITY I wonder if he 's busy working out even when he 's asleep , ... . $ENTITY I would n't doubt it !
... Yeah ! $ENTITY Your outfit today totally screams $ENTITY
$ENTITY Heyo , ... Out to market so late ... Well , ai n't you something ! ... !
ENTITY Boy , $ENTITY you have an uncanny ability when it comes to picking secret ingredients ... . $ENTITY You know , $ENTITY you might just have some cooking talent of your own !

$ENTITY I 'm so determined to be a good guest , ... it 's making me anxious .
$ENTITY I 've , like , always wondered why $ENTITY gets up $ENTITY SOOO early in the morning . $ENTITY It must be because she gets a great night 's sleep on this super-comfy $ENTITY !

$ENTITY You really like eating , $ENTITY do n't you ? $ENTITY To each their own , I suppose . $ENTITY One of my favorite things to do is read a book late at night . $ENTITY I get sucked right into the story !
$ENTITY Maybe I should try it on ?
$ENTITY I hope you enjoy your visit during $ENTITY 's $ENTITY Boy 's Day $ENTITY celebration !
$ENTITY Oh , ... I 've been meaning to tell you about $ENTITY Katie ... She 's a brassy young woman who 's set on exploring the whole world by herself . $ENTITY Kind of reminds me of myself , $ENTITY if you ask me . $ENTITY Heh . $ENTITY You should ask me and see what I say . $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY I 'm sure she could use a little help navigating $ENTITY , $ENTITY so say hello if you see her !
$ENTITY Oh , ... It 's me , ... When I was camping in town a while back , $ENTITY I got to know somebody who happened to be pretty cool ... It actually convinced me to come live in this town , ... But now that I 'm here , that person IS N'T ! Yup , just up and moved way ! $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I 'm not planning on moving again anytime soon , so let 's use this chance to grow our friendship !
$ENTITY Hmmm ... $ENTITY That 's cheaper than something that 's brand new , but ... $ENTITY I suppose even when old , $ENTITY can be spendy .
$ENTITY Umm ... $ENTITY 11+5 is ... Psst , $ENTITY ! Gim me the answer quick ! ... * ( 14 15 16 Stop cheating !
$ENTITY I 'm sorry for calling you over all of a sudden , ... Yesterday $ENTITY I had a dream you were moving to Saturn , as it 's fashionable these days , ... . $ENTITY So I figured I should see you once more before you left ... .
... I get the picture . $ENTITY You do n't have to say anything more ... .

$ENTITY Hold up ! $ENTITY I do n't need a makeover . My life is just fine . $ENTITY Maybe it 's not perfect , but it 's very acceptable . $ENTITY And if I let you touch my wardrobe , you 'd probably just sew pink bows to everything ! $ENTITY So no way , $ENTITY sister !
$ENTITY I 'm just sitting here $ENTITY thinking about life while the night winds blow ... . $ENTITY It 's pretty $ENTITY cold ! ... Brrrrrr ... Who decided that winter needed to be so cold ... ?
$ENTITY It 's 16 !
$ENTITY Well , it 's been awesome seeing your face again , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Guess it 's time for me to take off ! $ENTITY I 'll try to give you a heads-up next time I plan on dropping in . $ENTITY See you around !
$ENTITY It 's nothing too exciting , $ENTITY but the other day I was out on a walk and I found this in my neighborhood . $ENTITY It 's yours , $ENTITY is n't it , ... It seems like something that might have a lot of sentimental value ...
$ENTITY No good ? $ENTITY Yeah , yeah , I get it ... No worries ! $ENTITY Figured it was worth a shot ! $ENTITY Let 's just forget about the whole thing , ...
ENTITY Ya do that , $ENTITY and all the stuff ya done in the day gets remembered , see ? $ENTITY But if ya forget ... . $ENTITY Them fish ya caught ? $ENTITY The furniture ya finally got ? $ENTITY Them memories ya made ? ... POOF ! All gone in an instant ! ... Nobody wants to see that . So do n't forget to save properly ! $ENTITY And I know all 'bout them cheatin ' punks who reset on purpose too ! $ENTITY Somethin ' did n't go their way . $ENTITY Their shoes were too tight or their ma was mean or whatever ... . $ENTITY So they just quit without savin ' . $ENTITY They erase it from ever happenin ' ... . They 're using reset for do-overs !
$ENTITY It 's almost countdown time ! I swear , my heart 's about to jump out of my throat , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Wow , $ENTITY I could not have been more wrong about what $ENTITY 's place would look like ...
$ENTITY It makes sense that $ENTITY has ... He 's so competitive ! $ENTITY But he always tries to power his way through it . $ENTITY So he always loses . $ENTITY That 's 'cause a game like that needs more finesse than brute strength , you know , ... ?
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I guess I 'll never know $ENTITY if I 'd be happier here ... unless I move here , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ahh ! $ENTITY I 'm very satisfied ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's a resort ! $ENTITY It 's a tropical island ! $ENTITY It 's ...

I caught a brown cicada ! These things are everywhere ! ... mm $ENTITY
$ENTITY still cuddles up with her $ENTITY ! $ENTITY That 's , like , $ENTITY the cutest thing ever ! $ENTITY She 's just a big old girly girl at heart , ... How totally precious !
... Hmm . $ENTITY Well , that 's certainly an odd thing to see just sitting out there . $ENTITY Someone 's bound to trip over it and hurt themselves !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Having a huge department store like this so close by ... We 're lucky ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hee hee ! ... That 's an original ! $ENTITY I do n't give 'em to just anyone ! $ENTITY And , hey , come to think of it , $ENTITY you helped out everyone in town , right ? $ENTITY Way to go ! $ENTITY You 're the ... hero ! $ENTITY We 'll be countin ' on ya to help if this happens again , $ENTITY !

Hee $ENTITY hee $ENTITY hee !
$ENTITY Yo ! ... Lookin ' good , kid ! $ENTITY For me , rainy days are better than ... $ENTITY festivals or fireworks ! ... !

Also called `` northern shrimp , '' they have a life span of about 5 years , in which they are male for half .

$ENTITY Thanks to the $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY you gave me , $ENTITY I 'm feeling a little better now . $ENTITY At least , I think I am ... .

$ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY is exactly what it sounds like ! You can use it to have ever so much fun while fishing .

The famous tyrannosaur was one of the largest and strongest carnivores of its day . Though it could reach more than 30 feet in length , it was capable of speeds near 20 mph . Its hind claws were powerful , as were its razor-sharp teeth . This made the T. rex fearsome indeed .

$ENTITY The insects and plants just love this season , $ENTITY do n't they ? $ENTITY The whole town seems so alive !
$ENTITY That reminds metoday is $ENTITY Chuseok ... It 's a pretty important holiday for us . $ENTITY and that 's really all you need to know ! $ENTITY GAHAHA !
! $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY !
$ENTITY NO NO NO ! $ENTITY GAH , I do n't like bees ! $ENTITY GYAAAAH ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hahaha ! $ENTITY Did you really think you were gon na scare me with that ? ! $ENTITY I am SO not spooked right now . $ENTITY You wan na know how to REALLY scare people ? Challenge them to a game of chance ! Are you up for it ? If you win , I 'll give you a piece of deeeeelicious $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ! $ENTITY But if I win ... well , $ENTITY let 's just say I have a pretty awesome trick up my sleeve !
$ENTITY I like to dream about being ... Would n't that be amazing ?
$ENTITY That $ENTITY is wiggling happily because it lives in a place as nice as $ENTITY 's .
$ENTITY The $ENTITY spins around and around , $ENTITY and it 's so much fun , ... . $ENTITY If my house had a big yard , $ENTITY I 'd have my own !
$ENTITY Did you know you 've got something growing in here , ... It 's not a moldy sandwich , is it ? $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY You decorate with plants , ... ? $ENTITY But there are already so many plants outside . $ENTITY Why would you bring one inside ? $ENTITY You 're a weird one .
When I saw your ... my heart skipped a beat ! $ENTITY I 'll give you $ENTITY all the money I 've got ! ... Please make this deal with me !
$ENTITY Hmmmm ... Oh , $ENTITY sorry ... I 'm just obsessing over what to have for dinner tonight , ... !
$ENTITY Well , I guess there 's nothing to be done then . $ENTITY Sorry !
$ENTITY Wow , dressing for a very special occasion or something ? ... I 'm SO jealous , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Stopping to pull up weeds all the time is n't fun , $ENTITY but a day like today shows you why it 's necessary !
I guess the $ENTITY fireworks show $ENTITY is about to come to a close ! ... It 's a shame , but at least my blood 's pumpin ' !
$ENTITY Hmm ... There are too many items ! I ca n't make up my mind !
$ENTITY Hey there ... We can make ice cream out of all this snow , right , ... ?
The snow has melted quite a bit , has n't it ?
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY Is $ENTITY even capable of using $ENTITY that $ENTITY but who knows ? ... Maybe she 's a highly skilled programmer !
$ENTITY I do n't really know them too well ... but this sorta makes it seem like we 'd get along !
$ENTITY Haha ! $ENTITY That was fun ! $ENTITY It 's always nice to win something ! $ENTITY But do n't get so down ... We 'll play again sometime ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Do n't you think music sounds best played live , ... ?
$ENTITY Ah ... but please remember they ca n't be from just any old person ... I need you to go to another town and find $ENTITY people who look like horses $ENTITY who 'll sign the petition .

$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY So this is your collection ? ... I do n't recognize a lot of this stuff . ...
ENTITY An SD Card is not inserted ... . It says . $ENTITY , I think that means you need to check if you have an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in your $ENTITY Nintendo 3DS $ENTITY or not . But do n't forget to save and turn your system off before you put an $ENTITY SD Card $ENTITY in or take it out !
$ENTITY That $ENTITY seems like it 'd be a little complicated for someone like $ENTITY . $ENTITY Would n't it be funny if he was actually some kind of brilliant secret agent $ENTITY spying on all of us ?
$ENTITY Heh heh ! I 'm kinda digging the furniture in here , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY There 's nothing better than relaxing at home and talking to a friend !
$ENTITY Hey , ... It 's a day early , but happy birthday !
$ENTITY Yo ! ... # x0 ; Mayor ! $ENTITY Ehhhh ... That sounds so uptight and formal . But whatever . I 'm a little embarrassed . $ENTITY What I 'm trying to say is , we were seriously looking forward to your arrival . $ENTITY You 're gon na rock this town !
$ENTITY You have ? ! $ENTITY Well , I did n't realize there were TWO of us in this town , $ENTITY . $ENTITY But I 'll share the spotlight with you ! $ENTITY You 'd make a good costar , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Actually ... I 've decided to move to this town , ... I could n't say no to $ENTITY 's request , even if I wanted to ... So , yeah ! $ENTITY That means we 'll be neighbors really soon !
$ENTITY I do n't got time to play house with you ! ... I 'm busy , $ENTITY all right ? ! $ENTITY
... Huh . Maybe you 're right ! $ENTITY Yeah , I think maybe things 'll work out after all ! $ENTITY Yay for smells , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Well , at least you took good care of it . But next time ... . do n't peek !
$ENTITY You know you do n't have to wear that outfit every day , $ENTITY like you did when you were in school , $ENTITY right ? I mean , $ENTITY it 's cute , $ENTITY but there 's a whole world of fashion for you to explore now .
$ENTITY I think I 'll just bask in the fruity afterglow for as long as I can , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY R-really ? ... Cool ! ...
ENTITY I wo n't stop until $ENTITY every $ENTITY last $ENTITY letter $ENTITY is delivered to its intended recipient ... . RAIN OR SHINE ! $ENTITY But I 'm really glad it 's sunny today . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Woohoo ! $ENTITY It 's so good to see my time capsule again ! $ENTITY I ca n't even remember what I put in here . $ENTITY It 's time to peek inside !
One day , I thought I 'd just go for it and stick my head through the $ENTITY . And $ENTITY caught me at it ! ... I totally panicked ! $ENTITY Getting caught playing around like that at my age is just way too embarrassing ! ... !
$ENTITY Good evening $ENTITY , $ENTITY . So have you noticed ? $ENTITY The sun is up WAY past its bedtime . $ENTITY I suppose it is the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY . It 's allowed to , just for today .
$ENTITY Good morning , ... At least the plants should be happy with all this rain ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Even though I 'm on a camping trip , $ENTITY it 's so nice in here that I do n't want to go outside , ... !
You know the ordinance we have about getting up early ? ... I think it 's a great idea ! $ENTITY The earlier you get up , $ENTITY the longer you can nap ! $ENTITY It means a lot to me that the mayor cares about how much sleep we 're getting , ... .
$ENTITY OK ! $ENTITY Well , how about $ENTITY 's dream for the future ? $ENTITY My dream is to be $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Being the fake me , I 'm sure you do n't know anything about that !
$ENTITY Leaving so soon ? $ENTITY My place is n't that dirty , is it ? $ENTITY Hold up a minute , and let 's chat at least !
$ENTITY I want something to hang on a wall ! ... If you 've got something good , bring it to me ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY It 's not what it looks like ! $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY it 's exactly what it looks lik ... But I was dreaming about work ! ... I promise !
$ENTITY You think so ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY let 's find out ... . Sorry . $ENTITY It was in my right hand . $ENTITY It 's not the best ending , $ENTITY but at least you won a round . $ENTITY However ...
$ENTITY I ca n't believe it ! Did you find exactly what I wanted ? $ENTITY Whatever ! It 's nom-nom time , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh , good ! Then let 's hurry up and go to my house , ...
$ENTITY Good thinking , $ENTITY carrying an umbrella today . $ENTITY I do n't suppose you brought a second one , $ENTITY did you ?
If she 's feeling down or something , $ENTITY she tells her $ENTITY all about it ! $ENTITY Hmm ... Poor gyroids . Always having to listen to our problems ...
$ENTITY The hat is one of the best parts of the countdown ! ... Wearing it makes such a difference !
$ENTITY I wan na do a punk song while all glammed up ! $ENTITY I bet the contrast will blow your minds ! $ENTITY So I 'm gon na sing some questions , and you guys shout some answers . $ENTITY You got it , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Here we go ! $ENTITY Glam-rock guitar ! $ENTITY Whockah whockah whaaaaaa ! $ENTITY What makes your world go 'round ? ! ... Sing it ! $ENTITY Sing it ! $ENTITY Sing it loooooooud !
$ENTITY Here . Why do n't you take this ? It 's $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's so quiet here . $ENTITY It 's like a library !
$ENTITY Oh , bummer ! $ENTITY I just remembered something , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY SUPER important $ENTITY I have to do ! $ENTITY Sorry about all of this , ... ! $ENTITY Let 's do this another time , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY Well , a nighttime visitor ... ... What brings you all the way to our town , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Heh heh heh ... Oh , you want to know $ENTITY why I have a silly little smirk on my face ? $ENTITY No , ... I 'm not going crazy ! $ENTITY There 's a reason for it ! $ENTITY It 's because I received $ENTITY from ... Getting random presents is a great feeling , is n't it ? ... ?
$ENTITY OK , how about $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY , $ENTITY ? Yeah ? $ENTITY Sounds good ! No , thanks .
... It was my prized possession then , $ENTITY but I sort of lost interest in it ... . Probably because it was buried ... Huh ? $ENTITY There 's a letter inside too ?
Seems like everyone 's so busy today with cooking ! $ENTITY What 's up with that , ... ?
$ENTITY I know that $ENTITY is all about fitness , $ENTITY so he 's probably concerned with nutrition as well . $ENTITY His $ENTITY probably helps him whip up healthy meals .
$ENTITY Urgh ... You got some other place you need to be or something ? $ENTITY I can go see $ENTITY later on my own if you want . $ENTITY What do you want to do ? $ENTITY Sorry . Come with me . Yeah , enough of this .
$ENTITY Yep , that 's the toilet . $ENTITY 'Nuff said !
Even if I have n't done anything , I get nervous when I walk past a police station , you know ? $ENTITY Haha ! Come on ! $ENTITY You know I 've never been in any real trouble , right ? !
$ENTITY It might just be a coincidence , $ENTITY but , ... you always wear the same clothes , do n't you ?
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY Really , $ENTITY ? ! Just like that ? $ENTITY Here 's your ... Bells ...
$ENTITY I 'm trying out a new look today , ... I guess you 'd call it $ENTITY . $ENTITY What do you think ? $ENTITY I think it 's fashionable and functional . $ENTITY Shall we call that functionable ? $ENTITY We shall not .
You caught ... ... But it 's not what you 're looking for ! Release it and keep fishing !
$ENTITY What are you getting ? ... I 'm not sure what to buy yet , ... .
$ENTITY Nope , $ENTITY I actually want the other fruit . $ENTITY That 's too bad . $ENTITY Well , this is n't the best deal , but I 'll give you $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY for your $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Whoa ! ... It 's me , $ENTITY ! Do n't you remember me ? I only just moved here recently . $ENTITY But when I was back in ... I met someone from here . $ENTITY That person suggested I move here , but ... when I got here , $ENTITY that person had already moved away ... . $ENTITY It was sad when I found that out ... But I 'm OK now ! ... I like my new life , and I hope you and I will be friends . I 'll see you around , ... .
$ENTITY Woohoo ... I love the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY . You know why , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Because the forecast is `` dark with no chance of light '' ! Hahaha !
$ENTITY Hey , punk ! $ENTITY Why 'd you hit me ? $ENTITY
... Oh my ! $ENTITY I get the feeling $ENTITY this coffee is a bit different from my normal cup ! $ENTITY Who would think that changing the amount of $ENTITY sugar $ENTITY and the type of $ENTITY beans $ENTITY would affect it so much ... it 's still nice !
$ENTITY Ya know how I always say the first thing that pops into my head ? $ENTITY Well , now $ENTITY is mad at me ! $ENTITY I do n't even remember what I said ! $ENTITY Now I need to fix things , and a gift might do the trick , $ENTITY . But I ca n't go over there myself . I 'm too nervous ! $ENTITY Can you please deliver it for me , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY I heard that $ENTITY made a pretty wild birthday wish : `` $ENTITY `` ! $ENTITY Hmm ... I wonder what we can do to make sure that wish comes true ? $ENTITY Let 's put our heads together !
$ENTITY Heya heya , it 's $ENTITY all the way from ... Wait up , now ! $ENTITY It looks like you 've finally got room for my gift ! $ENTITY OK , here you go ! Enjoy !
$ENTITY Today 's $ENTITY Fishing Tourney $ENTITY was so fun ! ... And that 's more important than a silly trophy . $ENTITY Of course , $ENTITY winning a trophy is pretty sweet too , ... .
$ENTITY Pete $ENTITY says he often comes here around the same time as I do in the morning ... But I 've yet to run into him here . $ENTITY I 've often thought it would be nice to enjoy coffee together , so I 'm a little sad we have n't had the chance .
$ENTITY Yay ! $ENTITY Thanks ! $ENTITY Guess it pays to have good friends !
You look like a professional , so we 've decided not to label the replica fossils . You 'll need to use the knowledge and experience you 've gained up to this point to identify them .
Tonight $ENTITY an event called $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY will take over the town ! $ENTITY It does n't matter where you are , because if you look up , $ENTITY the moon is gon na be full and pretty !
$ENTITY Heh heh ... Hey ! Listen up ! $ENTITY I 've got an idea for ya , Mayor ... Do n't you wish there was a funky $ENTITY in $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Just imagine everyone 's smiling faces as they look with pride on our new ... So , $ENTITY I 'll talk to $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY about it , and you just keep it in mind ! $ENTITY Glad I can do my civic duty , ...
$ENTITY I guess you 're better off when you do n't have a ridiculous obsession like I do . $ENTITY Mmm ... Bottle caps ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Blech ! $ENTITY See ? It 's awful !
$ENTITY Knowing what kinds of things scare people can be valuable information , $ENTITY especially today ! $ENTITY Like , $ENTITY let 's say there was ... sitting here . $ENTITY would be terrified ! $ENTITY Or am I thinking of $ENTITY Sorry . $ENTITY I ca n't remember ...

$ENTITY Relax , kid . $ENTITY I know ya saved yer game properly last time ... . I ai n't here to chew ya out or nothin ' !
ENTITY Oh ! ... Pav $ENTITY can not believe his eyes . $ENTITY Is $ENTITY Pav $ENTITY seeing a $ENTITY rainbow feather $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY So nice ! $ENTITY So grand ! $ENTITY So $ENTITY Pav ... Can $ENTITY Pav $ENTITY have it ? $ENTITY Sure . No , it 's mine !
$ENTITY You see it a lot , do n't you ? Immature guys sword fighting with their umbrellas ? ... Why are you lookin ' at me that way ? ! I 'm not gon na do that !
$ENTITY I got ta say , you look like you just popped out of an old samurai movie or something ! $ENTITY That thing on your head alone sets the mood , but that super-classy $ENTITY tops it off !
$ENTITY Anyway ... I 'm glad you came to get me , ... I do n't think I would have come if you had n't been a part of this . $ENTITY So thank you ! ... Well , $ENTITY I 'd best be going to my next appointment ! $ENTITY Farewell , you two ! $ENTITY !
My place is so empty , it 's kind of depressing . $ENTITY I 'm thinking I should get some huge thing to fill up the space . $ENTITY If you 've got any ideas , $ENTITY will you whisper them in my ear ?
$ENTITY Hopefully the explorer 's spirit will help me challenge myself to new , exciting things throughout the year !
$ENTITY No , wait ! ... You came all this way , so please do n't go yet .
$ENTITY Yep ! ... and I are so winning that trophy !
$ENTITY Hee hee . $ENTITY Throwing my own beans really makes it feel like $ENTITY Bean Day ... Thanks for helping , $ENTITY bad ogre !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY it 's so beautiful when it snows like this . $ENTITY I just love to watch it piling up outside my windows .
$ENTITY Even though I 'm a slacker about cleaning my house , $ENTITY I 'm actually all about home improvement .
Football fish $ENTITY are really great in a rich stew or just deep fried . Man , $ENTITY either way , they 're delicious ! ... Not that anything will keep me from just eating this guy raw ! ... YUM !
$ENTITY My goodness , ... you 've come such a long way ! Thank you for deciding to celebrate with us today ! $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY is today , $ENTITY but so is the $ENTITY Bug-Off ... Seems like you picked a great day to visit !
ENTITY What ? $ENTITY Nothing to share with an old chameleon ? ! ... I feel like you 've put salt in my tea . How disappointing ... . $ENTITY Wait a moment . $ENTITY Could it be ? ... It seems that you do n't have a net . $ENTITY Well there 's your problem ! You do realize you can not catch bugs without a net , old bean ?
$ENTITY Holy cowfish ! $ENTITY You caught the perfect ... That 's amazing !
$ENTITY Nice ! $ENTITY You 're looking good , ... Like you 're on a tropical island ! Just looking at you $ENTITY makes me feel more relaxed , ... .
Well , $ENTITY if it comes to it , I can always take some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY , I guess ...
$ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY I suppose this present means $ENTITY and I will probably patch things up .
$ENTITY Quick , $ENTITY blow out the candles before they melt all over your cake !
'm sleeping , so please do n't wake me up . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ooh , I 've been waiting for you two ! ... Welcome to mi casa , $ENTITY and $ENTITY !

$ENTITY So , um , $ENTITY I have a present for $ENTITY But I 've never been the best at actually $ENTITY giving $ENTITY presents . $ENTITY I tend to just make things awkward . $ENTITY Would you mind taking it over for me , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Did you know today is the $ENTITY Harvest Festival ... I 'm gon na try to whip up something special !
$ENTITY Can you find me something lovely to place on top of my otherwise dull ... Do n't worry ! $ENTITY I 'm sure you can do it !

$ENTITY There 's a lot of really interesting furniture in here , huh ?

$ENTITY Good morning $ENTITY ! I was hoping someone would visit , $ENTITY .
For example , someone who loves to shop and has bought a great number of things ... .
Hey , ... I did n't realize it was already ... I 'm sorry , $ENTITY , is it OK if I maybe come to visit another time when I 'm more awake ? $ENTITY I wanted to stay and hang out , ... but I 'm too sleepy and ca n't really stay awake any longer ...
$ENTITY Hello there , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY , come back ! $ENTITY You got ta blow out the candles before they melt !

$ENTITY Heh heh ! $ENTITY I got the idea for a $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY stuck in my head , so I went ahead and put one together ! $ENTITY It 's like a love letter to the me of the distant future ! $ENTITY But ... I 'm an impatient meathead , so I 'll probably dig it up right away . $ENTITY Wait a sec ! ... You can bury it ... right ? $ENTITY Right ! Wrong !
... What ? ! $ENTITY You 'd already opened it ? $ENTITY But why , ... This was an important chance for me to make up with $ENTITY so why 'd you do something like that ? !

$ENTITY But ... .but ... . What am I going to do now ? !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY Why do we got ta do that all of a sudden ? ! $ENTITY Doing this funky exercise ... It 's punishment , not practice ! Gah ! $ENTITY

Walking sticks disguise themselves to confuse predators and are very closely related to walking leaves . They have cylindrical bodies that look like sticks .

$ENTITY Look , $ENTITY I 'll show you the honest truth , ... ! $ENTITY Here 's who I am ...
$ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY and $ENTITY are on bad terms ... The other day , $ENTITY I saw them arguing so much that they did n't even realize I was listening . $ENTITY When you see two friends fighting , there 's not a lot you can really do , huh , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY What if you already met yourself from the future , but you thought he was a dork ? Maaan , just think ... $ENTITY

I was waiting for you all this time , $ENTITY . $ENTITY So ? ! $ENTITY Did you forget we were playing hide-and-seek ? !

$ENTITY I really like the layout of her place . $ENTITY I wonder if something like this would work in my own house .
$ENTITY 's bookcase is stuffed with books about sports and fitness and stuff . $ENTITY There 's even one about high- performance shorts to wear while practicing $ENTITY . $ENTITY It 's not really information that 's applicable to my life ... .

$ENTITY Ha ! $ENTITY That 's ridiculous !

The megacerops was a mammalian grazer with a Y-shaped horn on its nose . It is a distant relative of the rhinoceros , which the horn helps give away .

These shrimp relatives are usually found in ponds and rivers , typically making them easy to catch . The reason for this strange habitat is that crawfish are plentiful and will eat just about anything . Eating plant material makes their bodies red , but only eating fish and meat will turn their bodies blue . A red color indicates they are eating a healthy and balanced diet , so red is the ideal for the species .

$ENTITY used to be really into watching TV . $ENTITY But he said he got scared after a week-long marathon . He thought the TV was going to suck him in ! That could n't really happen , right ? $ENTITY ?

$ENTITY Oh ? $ENTITY Is there something you need to do on Main Street ? $ENTITY Should we visit your house together some other day ? $ENTITY No , it 's fine . Yeah , another time .
$ENTITY Right ? $ENTITY I was totally thinking about all the pretty girls in town when I wrote it . $ENTITY Hey , ... What do you think about love songs ? $ENTITY Are they clichd or sweet ? $ENTITY Ugh , clichd ! Aww , sweet !
$ENTITY But what kind of yellow ... ? Canary yellow ? ... Wait $ENTITY what ? ! Do you think I 'm flighty ? Sorry . $ENTITY I 'm jumping to conclusions . I did n't mean anything by it , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I just get a little crazy when it comes to finding my place on the color wheel , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Look , $ENTITY I ca n't believe you missed all 3 times either . $ENTITY But I promise the game is fair . $ENTITY Why do n't we play again sometime ? ... I guarantee at least a 70.37 percent chance you 'll get at least 1 queen .

Whoa ... Never thought I 'd see you in this town . That 's far out . $ENTITY You after a song that 'll do you no wrong ? $ENTITY Let 's hear it ! No , thanks .

$ENTITY Oh , right ! $ENTITY That package for ... # x0 ; $ENTITY later , $ENTITY so I 'm just gon na handle it myself . $ENTITY Can I have it back ?

$ENTITY
$ENTITY But still , $ENTITY there 's no point in having tons of the same thing . $ENTITY If you were willing to take this item off my hands ... I 'd let it go for the crazy low price of $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY . How 's that sound ? $ENTITY Sounds good ! I just do n't need it .
$ENTITY

These tropical fish move very gracefully because of long fins on their backs and underbellies . Males and females are almost impossible to tell apart , making identification tricky .

These creatures are related to both octopuses and squids and originated about 60 million years ago . They have air and body fluid in their shells and move by adjusting the amount of body fluid inside . This allows them to either float or sink depending on the situation they find themselves in . They have nearly 90 tentacles that can stick out from under their shells to grab on to rocks or prey .
$ENTITY Do n't worry ! $ENTITY I 'm still right behind you ... Nice shoes , by the way .
$ENTITY Wow , that was a LOT of fun , $ENTITY . But I do n't want to wear out my welcome ... . So I think I 'll be going ! Thanks for having me . We should do this again sometime !

$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY What do you think of these clothes ? $ENTITY A friend from back home sent them to me , but ... How do they look ? $ENTITY Great Awful
$ENTITY For furniture and daily supplies , it 's $ENTITY Timmy and Tommy 's supermarket ... and for clothes it 's $ENTITY Able Sisters ...

$ENTITY I think I 'm going to ... try it on later in private ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY What 's the matter with you ? ! ... What 's going on ? ! $ENTITY I 'm freaking out ! It 's nothing .

$ENTITY So $ENTITY tomorrow would be your birthday , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY But there is no tomorrow this year ...

I hope you have 4 years ' worth of fun . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY do n't worry about me . $ENTITY I 'll be fine . $ENTITY I 'm more concerned about the friends I 'm leaving in $ENTITY . $ENTITY In fact ...

$ENTITY Be patient and you 'll find a great bug soon enough , ... .
Just so you know , $ENTITY if you need some clothes , $ENTITY Able Sisters $ENTITY over in the shopping district ! $ENTITY And do n't forget to try it on before you buy it , $ENTITY all right ? $ENTITY Oh , another thing ! $ENTITY We break our clothes into a few categories here in town , depending on sleeve length . There are $ENTITY shirts $ENTITY , $ENTITY tees $ENTITY , and $ENTITY tanks $ENTITY , or you could also say long sleeves , short sleeves , and no sleeves . $ENTITY Keep this in mind if you wan na become a true fashionista !
$ENTITY You two seem kinda similar somehow ... the way you open doors and stuff ! $ENTITY But , hey ! That 's great ! They say friends start picking up each other 's habits , $ENTITY !
# $ENTITY # x0 ; $ $ENTITY
$ENTITY Having two extra people here makes it feel real lively , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY He must really want to make up if he 's giving me such a nice present ! $ENTITY I 'd better go apologize too .
$ENTITY Your $ENTITY looks good on you , ... I can barely see your face , but ... you ARE $ENTITY , right ?
$ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Shamrock Day ... That hat of yours totally rocks ! $ENTITY Way to get $ENTITY into the festive spirit !

$ENTITY Ah , hello , ... This crazy day is going to turn my entire schedule upside down !
$ENTITY One cup of coffee to go , yes , yes ! Hm , and only ... spoonful $ENTITY of sugar .
$ENTITY Thank you ! ... I hope the present was a success !
$ENTITY Mm , $ENTITY I wonder which picture book I should look at tonight . $ENTITY It 's my own little $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY tradition .
$ENTITY I ca n't believe $ENTITY they canceled the awards ceremony ! I got dressed up for the occasion $ENTITY and everything !
$ENTITY I 've been sitting by the fire reading all the books I brought with me . $ENTITY I 've even read some of them aloud !
$ENTITY likes to keep ... around as a pet ! $ENTITY Like , crazy ! $ENTITY I can totally picture her swinging around a net and scooping up a bunch of awesome bugs !
$ENTITY A snowy $ENTITY Toy Day ... It 's certainly got a romantic charm to it , but there are limits , ya know ? !
$ENTITY Oh , hi , ... I 'm just talking with $ENTITY here about fashion .
$ENTITY If you have something you no longer need , please feel free to bring it by !
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY , I got something important to talk to you about ... You got a minute ?
$ENTITY If it 's a beautiful day and you feel like gazing up at the sky , $ENTITY just press up on . $ENTITY You might even notice something unusual , $ENTITY like a gift tied to a balloon ... . Or another unusual floating object ... Just a friendly tip . $ENTITY is a beautiful place , $ENTITY so take the time to explore every corner .
$ENTITY Yes , $ENTITY I suppose it 's not that easy to come by , ... .
$ENTITY Oh my ... Did you just pick a flea off of me ? $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I 'm so embarrassed . $ENTITY I hope you do n't think this happens all the time .
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY You mean , they HAVE those ? ... I never had that idea ... It might actually work , though , right ? $ENTITY It 's a great idea ! Do n't do it !
ENTITY Why do n't you try mingling with the town citizens ? $ENTITY Nothing builds trust like good old face time ! It should be easy , $ENTITY because everyone in town is very interested in getting to know their new mayor ! $ENTITY Sure , some of them will ask favors of you , $ENTITY but as long as you just smile and nod , $ENTITY it 'll be a piece of cake ! $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY you should probably actually help them , ... but make sure to do it with a smile on your face !
$ENTITY Haha ! Hats look good , right ?
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY good-bye . And please give $ENTITY my best .
$ENTITY But you would n't write a fan letter to the most talented pop star in town ? ! ... Sheesh !
$ENTITY Hey , nice ! $ENTITY I 've always thought over there was pretty great !
... =
$ENTITY Ah ! My pouch ! Where was it ? $ENTITY Uh-oh ... That weird critter with the big fangs got out ... But no worries . $ENTITY It 's probably not that dangerous ...
Lately I get the feeling there 's a lot less trash $ENTITY and fewer weeds , yeah ? $ENTITY Fewer wilted flowers , too ... . $ENTITY Is this because of that $ENTITY Keep ... ordinance thing you enacted ? $ENTITY Well , ... it makes this town look pretty stinkin ' nice ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY

Originally , all plants on the planet were actually sea dwelling , but then they eventually spread to land .

$ENTITY OK , $ENTITY here 's how you play ! $ENTITY I 'm gon na take a big bite out of an apple or peach without letting you see . $ENTITY Then you have to guess which one $ENTITY I ate ! $ENTITY Guess right , and that 's 1 point for you ! $ENTITY We 'll play 3 times . $ENTITY If you get it right 3 times , $ENTITY you can have the $ENTITY for free !

$ENTITY Now lem me ask ya somethin ' . $ENTITY Ya ever seen a message like this ? ... When you want to finish playing , press $ENTITY START $ENTITY and select $ENTITY Save and quit ...

'' ... I guess that 's the idea . $ENTITY And , $ENTITY yeah , $ENTITY I guess that IS one way to play . $ENTITY One WRONG way ! $ENTITY But doing everythin ' ya can to avoid resettin ' ... is the officially endorsed play style of Animal Crossing ! ... Takin ' everythin ' as it comes and rollin ' with the punches has its rewards ! $ENTITY That 's our stance ... . $ENTITY Which is where the $ENTITY Reset Surveillance Center $ENTITY comes in . $ENTITY You know it 's important 'cause it 's all highlighted blue and everything . $ENTITY So 24 hours a day , 7 days a week we 're monitoring all players ... And when a reset occurs , $ENTITY yours truly rushes to the scene ... to read 'em the riot ... Er , that is to say , ... to IMPRESS upon the player the importance of saving his or her progress . $ENTITY Now I know there 'll be those times . $ENTITY `` My batteries ran out ! '' $ENTITY `` I did n't do it on purpose ! '' $ENTITY `` It was an accident ! '' ... I get that ; do n't worry . $ENTITY Anyway , alls I wanted to do was say hello , and I ended up putting on a one-mole show ! $ENTITY Time I was goin ' !

$ENTITY Where should I build my house ? $ENTITY Perhaps near the shopping district so I 'll be near the fashion ... ? Or maybe close to the ocean so I can live adventurously ... Hey , you guys do n't have any tree houses around here , do you ? $ENTITY No ? ... That 's cool . I hate heights .
... . Nope ! That 's not it ! Too bad ! $ENTITY You got a few things to learn about this game , but it 's cool . ... is the answer !
$ENTITY I 'm just glad to see an old confidant doing so well for herself !
itchy ITCHY ! $ENTITY I got bit by a mosquito ... .

$ENTITY
$ENTITY I 've been catching snowflakes on my tongue . $ENTITY My record so far is 29 successful attempts in a row .
$ENTITY The country I was headed to is really famous for its tulips ! $ENTITY Being near all those colorful flowers gives an almost magical feeling ! $ENTITY Though some of that magic may have been blown in by the gigantic windmills , $ENTITY which are also awesome ! $ENTITY Wait . $ENTITY Windmills do n't really work like that , do they ... ? $ENTITY Point is , $ENTITY I 'd never forget the sight of the windmills in the tulip fields ! $ENTITY Too bad I ca n't remember the name of the country ! $ENTITY # xE ; Does that description sound like anywhere you can think of ?
... I knew it ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY This place is always so neat and tidy ... They must have a secret army of cleaning people or something .
$ENTITY
... . Wait $ENTITY you do n't even have ONE Bell to your name !
'd love to stay and chat , maybe have a cup of tea . But $ENTITY Phyllis $ENTITY would be really upset . $ENTITY She has eyes everywhere ... $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ugh . Just looking at $ENTITY 's mirror makes me think about him ... standing around ogling his own muscles all the time ! $ENTITY !
There is n't much time left in the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY , so $ENTITY give it all you 've got ! $ENTITY We may be rivals in this tournament , $ENTITY but I always cheer on my friends !
$ENTITY Re-Tail is buying stuff at higher prices ! $ENTITY But the prices at all the stores $ENTITY are pretty steep too ! $ENTITY If you can control your buying impulse , then you can save up a lot of money . $ENTITY But I always end up buying stuff , ... .
$ENTITY Howdy ! $ENTITY The name 's ... Good to meet you ! ... suggested I move here , $ENTITY so here I am ! $ENTITY Since this is a fresh start , $ENTITY maybe I should get rid of all my things and really start over . $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY unpacking all this stuff is such a pain ... .
$ENTITY Yes , $ENTITY I take that as a compliment . $ENTITY That 's how you get to be a model $ENTITY by being consistent ! $ENTITY Now , $ENTITY some might say I 'm not TECHNICALLY a model ... to which I simply reply , $ENTITY

one more thing ... We do require that all homeowners become members of the $ENTITY Happy Home Academy $ENTITY , hm ? They 'll just stop by from time to time and give your home an in-depth inspection . $ENTITY Very good to get one . $ENTITY The inspection is a comprehensive look at your room and furniture layout , your hygiene level , et cetera . $ENTITY If you 're given high marks , you might even receive a wonderfully elegant commemorative prize ! $ENTITY They 'll schedule the inspection , so there 's nothing for you to worry about . $ENTITY No worries at all , hm ?

$ENTITY Ya know , $ENTITY has a lot of cool spots we do n't necessarily advertise or anything . $ENTITY If I were a newbie like you , I 'd want to see 'em all , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Did you see my ... Hamsters are pretty great , do n't you think ? $ENTITY Though I 'm not sure how I feel about keeping them captive .
You know what I like in a home ? ... Two stories . Like $ENTITY 's place . Have you been there ? Actually , $ENTITY the more I think about it ... all that space could seem lonely . $ENTITY But $ENTITY it would n't be so bad if you shared it with a friend ... Maybe that 's what $ENTITY does .
... . Wait . $ENTITY You do n't have enough money on you right now !
... Well , $ENTITY thanks for taking the time to deliver this to me , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I knew this day would come ... One of you ogres was bound to track me down eventually ...

$ENTITY You look like a clown today , ... Does this mean you can do tricks and stuff ? ! $ENTITY Um , in that case ... I 'd like 5 balloon animals , please !
$ENTITY It 's the middle of the night , $ENTITY but some stores are still open ... What goes on in these places ?
$ENTITY Look at how nicely it 's wrapped up to be returned ... . She has very good manners sometimes !
$ENTITY We 've got to stay focused all day long if we want to win ! $ENTITY This is a really challenging event ! $ENTITY The fishing fans in this town are kinda weird , man ... Not that I should be talking about them .
$ENTITY You do n't have anything on the walls ... You must be going for a minimalist look ! $ENTITY Of course you have a distinctive decorative style . I love that about you , ... !
$ENTITY In some towns , they eat special food to celebrate $ENTITY Autumn Moon ... Even though we celebrate under the same moon , it 's different from town to town ! $ENTITY I 'd like to observe $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY in another town someday ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Notice anything different about $ENTITY , ... There are no special ordinances here ! $ENTITY We 're free to do whatever we want ! $ENTITY So ... uh ... let 's get started with that . $ENTITY Sometimes I think a new rule could actually spice things up a bit .
$ENTITY Do n't be nervous ! Just listen ! $ENTITY I 'm pretty sure you 'll like what I have to say , dude ! ... Remember that thing you were asking about ? $ENTITY I got my hands on it !
... You were really flowing with the coffee today . Coo ...

$ENTITY I guess I should have started planning something four years ago . $ENTITY !

I hear that $ENTITY Cyrus $ENTITY is often up late into the night , retooling furniture at his workbench . $ENTITY Speaking of which ... Those two get along so well , it brings a smile to my face . $ENTITY Looking at them makes me think that perhaps getting married might not be so bad . Not that I have any plans for that at the moment , of course , no , no ... .
$ENTITY Here 's the thing . $ENTITY already found me ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I get a little embarrassed when I have company over and all my stuff is out in the open , $ENTITY .

So $ENTITY uses a double bed ... Judging from her behavior , $ENTITY I 'd say she needs it because she tosses and turns a lot . I toss and turn a lot too , $ENTITY but only because it helps me get exercise when sleeping !
$ENTITY Your $ENTITY is the perfect size ! $ENTITY You could share it with a friend $ENTITY or stretch out and relax on your own , ... .

$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems like you 've become very informed on the habits of the fish here in town ... . It makes this old man so happy to see you filling in the blanks of your fish-collection encyclopedia !
$ENTITY You just keep this out in the open ? $ENTITY That 's some pretty out-there design sense , ... .
$ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY Did you really catch this ? $ENTITY Amazing ! $ENTITY You could be fishing at a professional level ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I think in some ways , the Countdown celebration is the one event of the year that gets me the most excited ... . Ca n't you see ? I 'm already trembling with excitement !
There is n't even an hour left $ENTITY until the new year starts ! ... I 'm starting to get really excited !
$ENTITY The money monkey is smiling down . $ENTITY Rather than holding back , $ENTITY maybe you should smile back at him ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You still need a place to live ? $ENTITY I 'd definitely recommend the area around my house ... but look around before deciding ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You ai n't gon na find nothin ' , $ENTITY so ya might as well quit snoopin ' around !

$ENTITY Oh , ... And what a lovely color ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Are you also going to take part in the moon watching tonight ? $ENTITY This time for sure I 'm gon na catch an alien from the moon ! $ENTITY Should I use a net or maybe a fishing rod for that ? I 'm not sure which one 's best .
$ENTITY Aw , barbells ! $ENTITY You got me !
$ENTITY There is one person in this town I have to take my hat off to ! Other than you , I mean ... Can you guess who it is ? ... Beeeeep ! $ENTITY Time 's up ! $ENTITY The answer is ... I have nothing but praise for that dude . $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Really ? ! $ENTITY Well , that 's fine then . Let 's catch up later , ... !
By the looks of it , the weather probably wo n't change much .
$ENTITY Hey , ... # x0 ; $ENTITY About that $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY from the other day ... Could you dig it up for me ? I had a second thought about it and realized it was somewhat odd ...

$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY What 's $ENTITY doing with $ENTITY It just feels so out of the ordinary for him to have a softer side ... Uh , $ENTITY I should probably stop thinking . $ENTITY You know , he must have a special reason for keeping it ...
$ENTITY I bet some of these turned into fossils $ENTITY while being out and about just like you are now !
$ENTITY I thought I should return this thing I borrowed from you a while ago ! ... Sorry I kept it for so long !
$ENTITY Coo ... They a treat for someone ... ?
$ENTITY Oh , hey there ! ... Did you come over here to sit and chat with me , $ENTITY ? Sorry , but there 's no more room on this bench ! $ENTITY Ugh ! Sometimes I just HATE being so popular !

$ENTITY Heh heh . $ENTITY It does n't look half bad !
The end of $ENTITY is coming closer and closer ...
right . So , ... on this $ENTITY is ready for change . $ENTITY What kind of design $ENTITY are you thinking of going with ? $ENTITY What do you suggest ? Use clothing fabric . Use a custom design . Just leave it off .
$ENTITY You 're wearing your countdown spirit on your head ! $ENTITY Maybe I need to show more spirit too !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Do n't you think ... gyroids look more and more mysterious the longer you stare at them ? $ENTITY You could especially say that about my $ENTITY there ... I 'll never get tired of looking at it !
$ENTITY
I see the sky glazed over with clouds , $ENTITY I feel gloomy and kind of in a sort of funk . Those are the days when it 's best to make some really vivid , colorful clothes to help boost my spirit .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY , please do n't go looking through the $ENTITY all right ? $ENTITY My baby pictures are in there ... . Wait ! $ENTITY I meant my ... NOT-baby pictures are in there ! ... Nice cover ... $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh my ! ... You look so impressive wearing that real helmet !

$ENTITY Do n't I look fabulous ? I 'm wearing one of $ENTITY I 'm the luckiest girl in town !
Hmmm . I ca n't decide where exactly I want to build a house ! $ENTITY But , hey ! $ENTITY Having no plans at all could actually be pretty cool !
$ENTITY You know , I 've been really good this year , $ENTITY so I 'm gon na ask $ENTITY Jingle ... for some new $ENTITY furniture $ENTITY .
Now you know I 'm not one to gossip ... but is n't $ENTITY 's house awfully small ? $ENTITY If I were mayor of this town , I 'd want a bigger place . $ENTITY Would n't you ?
$ENTITY Hee hee hee ! $ENTITY I get the feeling that Ms. $ENTITY and I will be very happy together !
$ENTITY All right , ye wee scampy shrimp . Time to smell this brew 's odors .
Can you help $ENTITY out ? I need $ENTITY and I thought ... Do n't make me beg ! $ENTITY Here you go ! Sorry . I 'm all out .
$ENTITY Wow ... I was so immature back then . $ENTITY So unlike the refined lady I am now .
$ENTITY So we 're done here , ... 'Cause I 'll get going , ... See ya later !
$ENTITY I 'd rather read a letter than eat some yummy $ENTITY . $ENTITY And that letter was totally tasty !
ENTITY All this fine stitchwork really gets my shoulders to cramp something fierce , that 's for sure ... $ENTITY But after we close today , $ENTITY Mabel $ENTITY said she 'd give me a good massage ... . Right ? ... Mabel $ENTITY ?
ENTITY Aunt Nellie 's fried tomatoes ! $ENTITY This is better than the current first-place record ! ... And what a beaut ! $ENTITY SLURRRRP ! $ENTITY What 's that ? ... Oh , I wo n't snack on your fine specimen when your back is turned ! That 'd be awful of me ! $ENTITY Now , as promised , I 'll trade you for a bully fine item ! $ENTITY Therefore , take this $ENTITY !
$ENTITY When $ENTITY was n't looking , $ENTITY I used her scale to weigh my head . $ENTITY It was pretty fun .
What 's up with you ? $ENTITY You do n't feel like wearing a New Year 's hat $ENTITY like everyone else ? ... ?
$ENTITY I 've got a few prized possessions in here . It took me a long time to find them , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY No ? What , you want me to find it for myself , $ENTITY ? OK then , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Sweets that are n't too sweet ? $ENTITY If that 's what you want , $ENTITY how about using fruits instead of sugar as an alternative sweetener ? $ENTITY Ooh , there are so many kinds of recipes ... I 'm starting to feel really motivated all of a sudden ! $ENTITY I 'll bring it over to you once it 's ready , ... !
$ENTITY
... This is a lot different from what I expected , ... But the selection of $ENTITY coffee beans $ENTITY does n't seem bad at all ... Oh well ... . I 'll come again some other time .
$ENTITY Looking at art is great , $ENTITY but it 's also nice just spending time in a quiet , $ENTITY warm space like this . It 's so relaxing , ... .
's no space on the wall to hang up that item ...
$ENTITY It 's good to see you ! $ENTITY I know you were n't expecting me , $ENTITY so I 'm lucky you 're home .
$ENTITY I never thought I 'd see this again ! $ENTITY Thank you , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Woohoo $ENTITY ! I was hoping for a guest tonight . Make yourself at home , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh yeah ! I need to thank you ! Here 's $ENTITY .
$ENTITY You really think his speaking voice is normal ? $ENTITY He sounds like a sonic boom to me ! He 's so loud that hearing him talk for too long makes my head hurt . $ENTITY Oh , I know ! $ENTITY How about from now on , $ENTITY we do n't speak and just communicate telepathically instead ? $ENTITY Sound good ? $ENTITY OK , let 's telepathize ! $ENTITY Mooooom $ENTITY moom $ENTITY mooooooom ... .
Well , I guess the item was n't quite right for you ? $ENTITY I can respect that .
$ENTITY I did n't expect $ENTITY to have ... But I guess her house does feel more like an upscale gallery than a home .
$ENTITY So the country I was headed to is famous for authentically spicy curry and fantastic vegetarian dishes ! $ENTITY I want to go there just to try all the food they have to offer ! $ENTITY Yum naan ! $ENTITY Yum veggie korma ! $ENTITY I 've also heard this place is a big tourist spot thanks to some palace called the Taj Mahal . Sure , I 've heard of it , ... but I 've never had a chance to see it . $ENTITY But that 's why you 're helping me ! ... Think you can figure out where I was headed now ?
$ENTITY Ummm , $ENTITY let me see ... Right now $ENTITY I 've got $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY on me . $ENTITY How does that sound ? $ENTITY # x0 ; It 's a dealio ! You must be joking !
$ENTITY What do you think of my place ? $ENTITY If you see anything you really like , I could let you have it ... $ENTITY Gim me ! Nah , that 's OK .
$ENTITY Hello , ... Hah ! Boy this weather 's great ! ... Perfect for a walk around town , do n't you think , ... ?

$ENTITY Truth is , ... was pretty persistent , so I told ... # x0 ; $ENTITY I 'd go ahead and move here . $ENTITY I 'm sure I 'll come by to say hi after the big move , but I just thought you 'd like to know , ... !
$ENTITY Hey , ... How come it took you so long ? ! ... I got tired of waiting !
Now please , $ENTITY . Open the door . I 'm starting to get a little upset ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY There 's this old guy with glasses $ENTITY giving out badges ! $ENTITY But $ENTITY he said I have n't earned any badges yet ... Waaaah ! $ENTITY How come there is n't $ENTITY a badge for eating , ... ?
Wow , I bombed at throwing my Bells around ! $ENTITY I guess I 'm just bad at being a big shot , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Well , hello ! $ENTITY I 've been waiting ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Something about you makes you seem really cool , $ENTITY but I ca n't quite put my finger on it , ... . $ENTITY I probably just ate something weird this morning is all ... . That makes me act goofy now and then .
$ENTITY Half the time I come in here and get distracted with the cool stuff , then completely forget what I came for .
$ENTITY Oh , wow . $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY owns $ENTITY Uhh , $ENTITY never mind ... I bet it 's just something her mom gave her and she never got rid of .
$ENTITY I went out for a jog and ended up in front of your house ! Lem me take a quick break at your place !
$ENTITY , I do n't think you 're ready $ENTITY for the big countdown . $ENTITY You 're not decked out $ENTITY at all !
$ENTITY This is the first letter you ever sent to me ! $ENTITY It really brings back the memories ! $ENTITY You were so awkward back then ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Well , OK ... I 'll take $ENTITY what you 've got on you now ! $ENTITY It 's a little bonus for your effort . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Well , I 'm sure you did n't mean anything by it . Not bad just means $ENTITY not ... . bad , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY And since $ENTITY picked it out for me , I think I 'll keep wearing it .
$ENTITY Welcome ... How do you like late-night $ENTITY , $ENTITY ?

$ENTITY
$ENTITY That 's the spirit ! $ENTITY I 'm really glad you can come over ! $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY what time would be best for your schedule , ... I 'm free anytime after , ... hmm , ... probably about ... today , ... !

$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I discovered when I made $ENTITY that you can include a tablespoon of $ENTITY butter $ENTITY . It adds a depth and richness that I really like .
$ENTITY Ah ... But ... I have work to do here ... .
$ENTITY If I do n't label each box with its contents , ... I wo n't know where to find anything later !
$ENTITY Hmm ... That ai n't half bad , sprout ! $ENTITY I would n't have a thing to complain about if this had been made with the right amount of milk ! $ENTITY I like my coffee to have the ... amount of $ENTITY milk $ENTITY . That 's just my way ! $ENTITY I 'll be back , $ENTITY so make sure you remember that for next time , whippersnapper ... . See ya again !

$ENTITY For a $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pie , you really want to bring out the sweetness of the fresh ingredients . $ENTITY And for that you 'll want the honey from a $ENTITY beehive ... It brings out the fruit 's true sweetness ... and then intensifies it !

$ENTITY Look at the time ! $ENTITY Why has n't $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY given out any presents yet ? Did he forget ?
$ENTITY I hear $ENTITY saw a spooky movie as a kid , and now ... # x0 ; has a wicked $ENTITY phobia !
ENTITY That $ENTITY was bought by $ENTITY from out in $ENTITY a few towns over . $ENTITY You see what sort of devotion folks have for ol ' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY 's business ? $ENTITY That 's the quality speakin ' there ... .

I hear that people nowadays put frilly pink covers on their seats ...

I , um ... I mean , $ENTITY what I want to say is ... I just could n't spit it out ... . I was standing there squirming , ... and she looked at me and said , ... `` I 'm sorry , $ENTITY who are you ?

$ENTITY Found something you like already , $ENTITY eh ? ... Good for you .

$ENTITY Uh-huh ! $ENTITY It 's sweet , $ENTITY perfectly ripe , $ENTITY and the texture is just right . $ENTITY But it 's not exactly what I asked for .

$ENTITY Oh , I gotcha . Well , you should definitely check it out later . It 's fun leaving notesand reading them ! $ENTITY One time when I passed by the board , I saw this super-cute $ENTITY bird $ENTITY sitting up on the top ! $ENTITY Super-cute things totally catch my attention , $ENTITY so I took a closer look , $ENTITY . $ENTITY It turns out that whenever there 's a new note , that little bird appears ! $ENTITY Totally mysterious , right ? $ENTITY Next time you pass by the bulletin board , you should check to see if that bird is there , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY The voices of bugs have a certain charm late in the fall .
$ENTITY Yay ! $ENTITY I wan na get my $ENTITY on so bad right now ! $ENTITY But I ca n't just get something going in here ! $ENTITY would get so mad at me ! Ha ha ! $ENTITY

ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY great timing , ... I have a bunch of letters addressed to $ENTITY 's mailbox is full ! $ENTITY Could you ask $ENTITY to clear out some old letters so I can deliver the new ones ?
ENTITY Well then , shall we get started ? $ENTITY Let 's begin ! Something else ...
$ENTITY Um , do you think I could visit your house sometime , ... I just like seeing how everyone else in town lives . $ENTITY You learn a lot that way ! $ENTITY Sure . I do n't think so .
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Way to make it here , guys .
So I hear sea anemone ... goes really great in miso soup . Ever hear this ? It 's got a real crisp texture ! ... But , you know , $ENTITY I think I 'll hold off on this guy . Do n't quite have the stomach for it just yet .
$ENTITY OK , how about you take what I put in the capsule as a thank-you , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Hey , you ! ... What took you so long ? ! ... I got tired of waiting for you !
$ENTITY You ca n't fool me ! $ENTITY I saw it with my own two eyes ! $ENTITY , just a bit ago , you hit your head on the store entrance ! $ENTITY You really surprised the shopkeeper ! ... Are you all right ? Did you bust your noggin or something ?
$ENTITY You 'll do it ? Great ! I can always count on you , ... Do it within $ENTITY 1 hour $ENTITY , OK ?

$ENTITY
ENTITY Welcome to the $ENTITY post office ! ... What can I help you with today ? $ENTITY Send mail . Nothing .
$ENTITY Snowy days have a particular smell . $ENTITY They just feel really pure , like they could hide the smelliest smell in the whole wide world ! $ENTITY But it 's still not OK to go around all stinky . You still need to take baths , OK ? $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY ?
ca n't do that right now because your pockets ca n't hold the item you 're replacing with the design !
$ENTITY So you think I 'm the impostor , $ENTITY huh . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY fine . $ENTITY Just hand me that towel , $ENTITY and we 'll see .
$ENTITY So ... . you opened it ? $ENTITY Not even I would do that ! $ENTITY And that makes you more of a troublemaker than I am , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Well , I 'll see you later ! $ENTITY And please say $ENTITY hi to $ENTITY for me !
$ENTITY Oh ... . I do n't love this look , $ENTITY and the color is n't great either . ...

$ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY I thought that 's what it was ! $ENTITY I 'm sure you can use that knowledge to your advantage , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Since I do n't normally spend my time staring up at the moon , I 've never noticed before , but ... It 's real pretty ... Just like a bunch of cheese or something equally as delicious ! ... !

$ENTITY I was running in the cold without paying much attention , and the next thing I knew I was here ! $ENTITY I did n't wan na waste my trip , so I decided to settle in and camp ! $ENTITY It 's like an impromptu vacation ! $ENTITY Ha ha ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY
Wait a second ! ... This thing is crawling with worms ! $ENTITY Why would you bring me this ? $ENTITY It 's gross ! $ENTITY This is , like , the opposite of what I wanted , ...

$ENTITY
Hmmm ... I hope I can find a town as fun as this one . $ENTITY If you know of a good one , $ENTITY PLEASE let me know , ... How about my town ? I know nothing .
$ENTITY I 'm a bit of a night owl $ENTITY well , more like a night $ENTITY so it 's great that stores in town are open late ! $ENTITY Hip hip hooray to our awesome mayor ! Yay !
$ENTITY Plants are great , and they heal your soul . $ENTITY Fruit trees are especially great , $ENTITY 'cause they fill your belly too !
ENTITY That $ENTITY Santa bag $ENTITY is a magical sack filled up with presents for everyone here in town ! $ENTITY But $ENTITY at dawn , the magic will break and the bag will return to normal . So please be very careful . The presents the town residents requested are inside that bag ... Just think twice when you give out a present , kid . That way , everyone 's wishes will be able to come true ! $ENTITY I 'll be waiting around town until dawn , so deliver all the presents and then return the bag to me . $ENTITY OK , good luck ! $ENTITY
Hmmm ... Almost got it ! $ENTITY Yep . Almost . $ENTITY It 's easy to get something 70 percent of the way done . $ENTITY But being dedicated enough to go that extra 30 percent takes you from amateur hour to pro . And I really want you to become a professional snowman maker . $ENTITY But , geez . Sorry for sounding so strict ! I really should be thanking you for making me !
$ENTITY Yeah , it 's time for a change . $ENTITY I need to ditch the $ENTITY hanging on my wall . I 'd like to replace it with something similar ... but new . $ENTITY Hey , ... Let me know if you come across anything that will work !

$ENTITY Hey , thanks ! It 's like my speech just got new shoes . $ENTITY I think I 'll take my mouth for a walk , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What a neat little bed ! Yeah , $ENTITY , good choice putting this $ENTITY in here .
$ENTITY Now that we have that rule about stores staying open later , ... is really lively at night . $ENTITY Being a night owl is actually really fun , ... .
$ENTITY Hm ... Now where should I put it ?
$ENTITY Ugh ... . I 'm not in the mood to talk , ... Please just let me mope for a while .
$ENTITY likes to curl up in this ... with a good book . $ENTITY She just does n't get it , though ... is meant for doing gymnastics ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yeah , yeah ! $ENTITY So to get your power , first you got ta get scared ... or angry ! $ENTITY Like maybe if your friends or family members are in mortal danger ...
$ENTITY Having $ENTITY candy $ENTITY taken is pretty much $ENTITY the worst thing I can imagine , $ENTITY so $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is rough for me ... .
$ENTITY You did n't forget , did you ? You 're getting signatures for my petition , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Why 'd you hit me ? ! $ENTITY I thought we were friends , ...

$ENTITY Ha ! $ENTITY You 've revealed yourself as a phony . $ENTITY Everyone knows my special talent is $ENTITY .
$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You 're leaving ?

$ENTITY Well then , here 's your reward ! $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Now we 'll find out what 's really going on here .
Despite its reptilian appearance , the dimetrodon was not actually a dinosaur , as you 'd assume . It was , in fact , a mammal-like reptile that went extinct before the first dinosaurs appeared . It had knife-shaped teeth for slicing , as well as smaller ones for crushing . The large fan on its back was used to regulate body temperature an important feature of the time .
$ENTITY I 've prepared something special for $ENTITY Labor Day $ENTITY , $ENTITY so talk to me when you have room in your pockets !
$ENTITY I say 40 is n't old ... if you 're a fossil . $ENTITY Seriously , $ENTITY all of these things are many thousands of years old !
$ENTITY makes me pretty happy , but ... being surrounded by bugs does n't really generate the same effect , ... .
$ENTITY Now , now , $ENTITY do n't be like that !
Oh ! Good day ! $ENTITY Um ... My head is ... a bit off , is it not ? $ENTITY Ugh ! Did you even pay attention when you were making me ? ! $ENTITY You are my creator ! $ENTITY Do something ! ...

$ENTITY We got ta dance until the last rays go away ! We wo n't have a day like this for another year , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You were wearing something like this $ENTITY the other day as well , right , ... ? $ENTITY Heh . I guess you get pretty set in your fashion sense , do n't you ... ?
ENTITY What I 'm about to tell you is also very important ... These turnips have a shelf life of one week . After that , they rot . $ENTITY Oh , and turnips are very sensitive to time paradoxes , so if the clock changes , they 'll die instantly . $ENTITY I come to sell turnips every Sunday , so unless you sell all your turnips before $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY closes on Saturday ... $ENTITY Well , you 're looking at a big loss ! ... Just be mindful of all your turnips ... . Oh , see ? I tend to go on and on once I get started talking turnips .
$ENTITY Happy stinkin ' New Year , ... Here 's to another year together as buddies !

$ENTITY After all , I make sure I eat lots of really hot food ! $ENTITY Because they say cold food cools you down and ... that 's bad for your digestion or something ? $ENTITY So I always make sure to heat up my $ENTITY before I start eating it !
$ENTITY Yessss ! $ENTITY I look awesome ! $ENTITY This is perfect for me !
$ENTITY Still , you 're pretty sweet MOST of the time , so I forgive you . $ENTITY And , surprise , surprise ... . I actually got this for you ! Here . It 's $ENTITY !

They get their name from their somewhat blackish bodies , though they have a green tint . They usually hide in weeds and wait until other fish approach before forcefully striking . Many people use lures to catch black bass because they are such strong fish . Black bass have a fierce image , as the males will scare off other fish to protect the fry in the nest . They are related to sea bass , so they make for a tasty dinner , though their skin has a very strong odor .
