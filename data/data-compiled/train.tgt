$ENTITY I 've prepared a small present to celebrate the new year . $ENTITY Here you go ! Enjoy !
$ENTITY You decided to stop by all of a sudden , and I did n't have time to clean my place up ... . $ENTITY So , ... please do n't judge my room too harshly , OK ?
$ENTITY Heya , ... It 's the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY today ! $ENTITY The sun 's not going down tonight , right ? $ENTITY I can sleep anywhere anytime , $ENTITY so I 'm not worried about it , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Wahoo ! $ENTITY There sure is something special about the flavor of a really good $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I am completely satisfied right now ! ... !
$ENTITY Absolutely $ENTITY ornate $ENTITY !
Would n't it be funny if a fish cast a line with pizza on it up here onto the shore ? $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Now that the solstice is here , $ENTITY I 've got ta get into $ENTITY Summer Mode ! $ENTITY Woohoo !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY This $ENTITY is really convenient for dealing with garbage . Normally you have to pay $ENTITY Reese $ENTITY to get rid of your garbage for you ... Every house needs ... ! $ENTITY !
Was $ENTITY in the middle of eating $ENTITY when we stopped by ?
$ENTITY I did n't know $ENTITY was so into art . $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY she has ... ! $ENTITY Even if it 's a fake , $ENTITY the girl has good taste .
$ENTITY Haha ... You left your $ENTITY out ! $ENTITY But I get it ! $ENTITY Having stuff like that close at hand can be comforting . $ENTITY You feel like you can get your clean on at any time ! ...
$ENTITY For your outstanding performance , you 've earned a Gold Tortimer award and ... # x0 ; ls m $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You 've been wanting one of these , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I know it 's not your birthday or anything , $ENTITY but I found one for you while I was shopping .
$ENTITY There might be things here we should n't touch ! ... Make sure you check with $ENTITY first ... Then touch 'em all ya like !
$ENTITY Getting cold and wet in the dark ... $ENTITY Man , it 's hard to have a good time on a rainy night , $ENTITY .
You 've heard of $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY from the tailor 's shop , have n't you ? $ENTITY It would be hard to forget a girl like her ! Thanks in part to her ultratrendy name , which yours truly bestowed on her . $ENTITY You 're welcome , ... Labelle $ENTITY ! Now that she 's back here in her hometown , I thought for sure she 'd go back to using her original name . But `` $ENTITY Label $ENTITY `` does n't have quite the same ring to it , now does it ?
$ENTITY Huh ? ... contest ? $ENTITY That sounds lovely ! $ENTITY But this is the first I 'm hearing about it ... I 'll check around ! $ENTITY If there really is a contest , I 'd love to be in it ! $ENTITY We 'd better act fast !
$ENTITY Wow , you 're really ... attached to your ... If we played hide-and-seek in that outfit , I bet even I would n't be able to find you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I always get so excited to visit friends ' houses !
$ENTITY I 'm deciding what people are going to have for dinner based on what their faces look like . $ENTITY ... $ENTITY The look on your face makes me think you 're going to chow down on ... Hmmm ... , maybe ?
Hey , ... Do you remember me by any chance ? $ENTITY We met the other day when I was camping here ! ... I moved to $ENTITY because you suggested it 'd be a good idea ... Anyway , $ENTITY we live in the same town now ! $ENTITY That makes me super excited ! Are n't you excited , ... ?
$ENTITY Eep ! You look SO sweet in your ... I can totally imagine you as a mini version of yourself , $ENTITY living in some gorgeous , teensy-tiny house ! $ENTITY Would n't it be fun to live as dolls ? $ENTITY I bet I 'd play dress-up a LOT more than I already do !
$ENTITY Well , that 's a super bummer ...
$ENTITY Hi , $ENTITY Mayor ! $ENTITY Welcome to ... I heard our new mayor was coming , $ENTITY so I was anxious to see what kind of person would show up ! $ENTITY Calling you `` Mayor '' sounds too stiff , $ENTITY so I 'll call you $ENTITY , OK ? $ENTITY Oops ! ... Let 's talk when you 're done with everything at the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY .
Man , $ENTITY do n't mess with a sick person !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Then you let out a big , strong belly laugh , ... GAHAHA ! ... Like that !
$ENTITY Ready for this ? Modern vibe . Simple but functional ... That , my friend , is what we call the $ENTITY Trendy $ENTITY style . $ENTITY Redundant ? Oh yeah . But redundant in a hip way . Bang ! Think grown-up tastes . Originality . Futuristic . Cool . $ENTITY You 're up for it , right ? The $ENTITY Trendy $ENTITY theme challenge ? Good to go ? $ENTITY Sign me up ! I 'll try something else .
$ENTITY It 's nice to have a supermarket that stays open late at night . $ENTITY I 'd even say it was ... super . Haha ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY has one of the biggest department stores around ! $ENTITY Lots of folks like you come from out of town just to see it in all its glory , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Does n't it seem like $ENTITY there are a lot more balloons flying around than normal , ... ? $ENTITY Hmmm . $ENTITY Maybe it has something to do with $ENTITY Bunny Day $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Treat my $ENTITY right , OK , ... ?
$ENTITY I need your help to make this event a fun one ... . I 'm really counting on your cooperation !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Everyone in town has been counting down to December 24th !
$ENTITY Yeah , it 's like ... I dunno ... Warm $ENTITY or something . $ENTITY But it 's an OK smell , not a bad one !
$ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , really ? ... liked it ? $ENTITY Who knew $ENTITY # x0 ; had good taste ?
$ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY WAAAAH ! ... Please , $ENTITY scary ... take a piece of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY and go away !
$ENTITY All right , let 's just open this up right now !
$ENTITY I absolutely love paleontology ! $ENTITY I could look at fossils all day and not get bored .
The hammerhead shark is a shark with a head like a hammer , which is what you 'd expect . However , despite being sharks , they are actually fairly laid back , which is not what you 'd expect . With their eyes positioned on the two ends of their `` hammer , '' they can see in almost all directions . Oddly , their nose holes are located right next to their eyes on their hammer section . They have a number of small holes on the front and lower portions of their heads as well . These holes allow them to detect prey , even fish hiding below them and out of sight . While they eat a nice array of fish , it seems rays are their favorite source of food . Rays , beware !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Do you like fish , ... I love them ! $ENTITY They 're good grilled $ENTITY or stewed ! But putting them in a salad is good too ! ... If you make a $ENTITY fish salad ... throw some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY in there ! It adds a little zing that is just super delicious , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Decorating with something bold like ... She finally got herself a clue ! $ENTITY That $ENTITY , $ENTITY she 'd been all worried that her room did n't have enough personality ! ... Well , good choice ! $ENTITY Good choice ! ... GAHAHA ! ...
Look at the world through rose-colored glasses . ''
$ENTITY You got it all wrong , ... It 's not just that I think they 're cool ... It 's that , in the future , I 'm gon na BE an old dude !
$ENTITY You 're the greatest ! $ENTITY You brought me ... With this in my room , $ENTITY I can feel like I 'm at the beach any time of day .
$ENTITY I 'm not quite sure where to put this now . $ENTITY I 'll figure it out later !
$ENTITY I 'm so happy to hear that ! $ENTITY Thanks a bunch ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Why , of course ! It 's a bold fashion choice , you know . $ENTITY This item is from Gracie Femme , $ENTITY my ladies ' line . But that 's not to say a man like you could n't pull it off !
$ENTITY This wo n't take long . $ENTITY I just found something I thought you 'd like while I was out shopping . So $ENTITY I bought it for you . $ENTITY
I see ... Well , I guess I 'm not shocked , $ENTITY considering how I talk to people . $ENTITY But ... wait a sec ! $ENTITY How can I be sure $ENTITY you are n't just judging me by my looks , $ENTITY ?
, you ! $ENTITY Yeah , it 's me again . $ENTITY You wan na tell your ol ' pal $ENTITY Resetti $ENTITY what happened ? $ENTITY ( I wanted to reset . My batteries died . I do n't remember .
$ENTITY Anyway , thank you for going to the trouble of bringing this to me !
$ENTITY is always so ... you know ... . But he 's actually got himself ... ! $ENTITY If HE likes cute things , $ENTITY and I like cute things , $ENTITY does that mean we 're like $ENTITY two peas in a pod ?
Well ... it 's not really $ENTITY my cup of tea , if you get my drift . $ENTITY But at least $ENTITY you picked out yummy $ENTITY coffee beans $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I think it 's your $ENTITY style and panache that 'll keep me coming back here for more coffee !
$ENTITY If you do n't hurry up and blow out those candles , they 'll get all melty !
$ENTITY My left hand , $ENTITY huh ? $ENTITY Let 's see if you guessed correctly . $ENTITY Nope , $ENTITY too bad ... . Better luck next round .
$ENTITY Oh ! ... You came to celebrate !
$ENTITY Check out that stylin ' hat ! $ENTITY It 's , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY totally perfect $ENTITY for today 's celebration . $ENTITY You 're looking good !
$ENTITY Honestly ? My crew ? A bit of a mystery to me too . $ENTITY Ol ' $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY kind of admires them . Bam .
Oh , $ENTITY really ? $ENTITY Ugh , I wish I could have seen $ENTITY 's face ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Yay ! $ENTITY It 's ... You made it even though it 's raining . $ENTITY What a trooper , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Yo , ... Imagine running into you here at this hour , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Do $ENTITY sun $ENTITY flow-ers $ENTITY need $ENTITY lots $ENTITY of $ENTITY sun $ENTITY to $ENTITY grow ? $ENTITY I $ENTITY guess $ENTITY maybe $ENTITY that 's $ENTITY just $ENTITY a $ENTITY su $ENTITY per $ENTITY sti $ENTITY tion . $ENTITY
, $ENTITY but I ca n't send any letters addressed to $ENTITY right now because $ENTITY 's mailbox is full .
$ENTITY You know how sometimes a pop- culture icon , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY totally RULES a year ? Yeah , $ENTITY that 's gon na be next year . $ENTITY And it 's gon na be the year of the $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 'm feeling a bit feverish today .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY ! $ENTITY What am I doing now ? $ENTITY Moisturizing my skin in the rain , of course !
$ENTITY The $ENTITY sure is big ! ... says he needs a big bed $ENTITY for his hip pain . $ENTITY But I think the real reason $ENTITY is so he can jump around on it when no one else is around .
$ENTITY K.K . Slider $ENTITY is super popular lately ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY This town 's dream has been given a $ENTITY Dream Address $ENTITY of $ENTITY . If you give out your $ENTITY Dream Address $ENTITY to others ... they can use that information to easily access the dream about $ENTITY . Something to consider .

I should also mention ... .
$ENTITY There are still two of us hiding . Keep at it , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY is tomorrow ! $ENTITY Augh , I ca n't believe it ! $ENTITY I do n't know why , but I 'm kind of nervous ! $ENTITY I really hope $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY is good to me this year .
$ENTITY Medicine $ENTITY , huh ? Maybe I 'll try some .
$ENTITY You really know what you want , huh ? $ENTITY That 's an awesome trait ! Thanks for playing with me .
Hmm ... I wonder if anyone else is searching for ... .
$ENTITY Hi again , ... What 's up now , ... ?
You know who I do n't really like ? ... . $ENTITY I know that might be mean to say , $ENTITY but we just clash . $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY we both kind of know we 're not compatible , $ENTITY and that makes it work somehow . $ENTITY Heh . $ENTITY We 're probably friendlier to each other out of respect than we are to our actual friends .
Yo , ... This is short notice , but $ENTITY wan na come see my place ? ... I 've got a lot of stuff I wan na show off ! $ENTITY Yeah , I 'll come over ! Ca n't today .
$ENTITY So did I tell you that I was thinking of moving out of town ? $ENTITY I felt like I did n't fit in here , $ENTITY . $ENTITY But the thing is , $ENTITY told me I should stick with it a little longer . So I am ! Hey , and I just wanted to say $ENTITY let 's try to be better friends , ... I know I 'm a little , $ENTITY well , $ENTITY quirky . $ENTITY But I 'm turning over a new leaf , and I wanted to be sure to tell you !
$ENTITY Brrrrrr ! I feel like I 'm turning to ice from the inside out ! $ENTITY So if you bump into me later ... ? $ENTITY And I seem cold , ... I 'm probably FROZEN ! Promise to thaw me out !
What 's really sad is that everyone assumes someone else will clean up the town . $ENTITY I think it 's important to have the initiative to clean all the time ! $ENTITY I 'm talking about you , of course . $ENTITY I 'm too busy to do any cleaning myself . $ENTITY I mean , where would I find time ?
$ENTITY Well , I guess this gift means $ENTITY and I will put things behind us then , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY NO WAY ! You brought me $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Where did you find such a rare bug ? $ENTITY I knew only one person could do it . $ENTITY And that 's YOU !
$ENTITY Totally ! You were there ! $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY you said that whoever burped lost the battle !
$ENTITY Argh ... Look , I 'm in a bad mood . $ENTITY If you do n't want to hear me say something mean , $ENTITY you should just go away ! ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Do you know what today is , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well , I should certainly hope so ... It 's your birthday ! $ENTITY I sent you a little something in the mail ... so be sure to take a look , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY When you get sick , it 's best to take some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY right away .
$ENTITY That is so awesome ! $ENTITY I 've wanted ... for a super-looooong time ! $ENTITY You 're the man , ... I will find a way to repay you for this ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY

$ENTITY Mayor , I 'm so impressed to see you doing your part to liven up $ENTITY Boy 's Day $ENTITY for our residents ! Wonderful !
$ENTITY Yep ! I like to practice swinging my bug net around . $ENTITY It helps me stay in top bug-catching condition !
$ENTITY Aww , shucks . $ENTITY I guess sometimes it pays to ask , ... .
$ENTITY Is n't the moon beautiful tonight ? $ENTITY I find myself stopping to stare up at it . $ENTITY We call this the $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey there ! Have you seen Mayor $ENTITY 's house yet ? $ENTITY It 's really huge ! A good mayor deserves to live in such a big place , right ?
$ENTITY That was fun ! $ENTITY Let 's do it again sometime , ... !
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY this is an awfully large $ENTITY for just one person . $ENTITY But I bet $ENTITY is the kind of fitful sleeper who needs space . $ENTITY He probably snores like a chainsaw too !

$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY What a weird-looking fruit ! $ENTITY Looks tasty , but ... Wait . $ENTITY IS THIS RAW ? ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY The secret to avoiding pranks on $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY is to make sure you have plenty of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY on hand . $ENTITY Installing a sophisticated TP-sensing radar in your yard is also not a bad idea ... . , I 'm prepared !
$ENTITY I thought of a great way to liven up ol ' ... Yeah , we should totally put $ENTITY somewhere here in town ! $ENTITY How 'bout it ? $ENTITY Easy , right ? ! $ENTITY I 'll tell $ENTITY Isabelle $ENTITY about it , $ENTITY so consider bringing it up at your next $ENTITY bigwig $ENTITY meeting or whatever , ...
Oh , ... Do you like to cook , ... Well , that 's lucky , ... 'cause I love to eat ! $ENTITY Will you make something for me sometime , ... ?

$ENTITY I really do n't expect anything . $ENTITY I mean , to think that anyone would remember to get me a present ... I got you something ! Yeah , I kinda forgot .
$ENTITY I 'm the real $ENTITY , $ENTITY and I can prove it ! $ENTITY I was born on ... .

$ENTITY Hey , I 'm not a bad cook when I have to be , you know ? $ENTITY I boil water and heat things in the microwave from time to time ... What 's that ? $ENTITY You do n't think that counts as cooking ? ! $ENTITY Well , the food gets cooked , do n't it ? $ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh no ! $ENTITY Bees ! $ENTITY Did you $ENTITY wake them up from their nap time ? $ENTITY You probably deserve it then , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Too bad ... Someone took the time to pick out these clothes just for me . $ENTITY But the world 's not ready yet ... .
... I can just picture you hanging out in here $ENTITY listening to some upbeat music .
Come on ! Do n't be so uptight !
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY It looks like I somehow put in ... Man ! $ENTITY I did n't take this seriously at all ! $ENTITY And let 's see , ... what 'd I write on the letter I stuffed in ... . ?
$ENTITY Oh , ... It 's me , ... Somebody tried to convince me to move to $ENTITY , and , well , I guess it worked . $ENTITY So I ended up moving here from ... but that person no longer lives in this town ! $ENTITY That was a long time ago , though ... Anyway , $ENTITY I hope to see you around again sometime , $ENTITY !

A bit ago , ... and $ENTITY got into a real huge fight of sorts . I guess you could say they 're like cats and dogs or oil and water . $ENTITY They just do n't mix ! $ENTITY Why ca n't they be more like cats and pigs or oil and juice or just something like that ? ... Knuckleheads !
$ENTITY I do n't have my appetite back ... but I 'm feeling better . I took some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY .

$ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's nice to finally get a good look at it !

No ? But I have TWO of them now ! $ENTITY Well , I guess I 'll ask around town .
$ENTITY There are still lots of recipes I want to try . $ENTITY I 've seen some fascinating shows on the local cooking channel .
$ENTITY You ever seen a spider the size of a yacht ? Maaan , me either . And I want to KEEP it that way ... $ENTITY

$ENTITY That 's great , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Heh . Just look at you ! You 're like $ENTITY 's fruit rustler !

$ENTITY Your outfit looks just as tasty as it did before , ... !
$ENTITY I 've noticed ... your house keeps getting bigger , does n't it ... You 're still building onto it , right ? $ENTITY Or $ENTITY are you pretty satisfied with the way it looks right now ? $ENTITY I 'm happy with it ! I 'm still working on it !

$ENTITY Only a few minutes until $ENTITY is over ! $ENTITY I bet I could cram in a few hundred last-minute , core-blaster crunches !
$ENTITY Do you think people in other towns see the moon the same way we see it ? 'Cause I do ! $ENTITY We all celebrate the same moon , but I 'd love to see it in a different town sometime ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Wow . $ENTITY I ca n't believe you 're just shooting me down like that , ... I thought we were pals . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Here . Take this . It 's not much , but you deserve it !
$ENTITY Coconut tarts $ENTITY are the kings of all desserts . $ENTITY If you want to bring out the sweetness of the $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY more , $ENTITY you can add some honey . You can get honey $ENTITY from a $ENTITY beehive ... and it 's so worth it 'cause fruit and honey are amazing .
$ENTITY Oh no , $ENTITY is your bag missing ? ! $ENTITY What did $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer say ? $ENTITY Does n't he usually carry it for you ?

Sorry . $ENTITY This is n't a good time for me to chat . $ENTITY
$ENTITY In that case $ENTITY , you could probably use better metaphors . $ENTITY I can help you with them .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY You know what I 'm gon na do this year ? $ENTITY I 'm finally gon na kick this nasty cheese habit .

I swear , you 're practically obsessed with those things ! $ENTITY And ya know somethin ' ? ... I do n't buy it at all ! $ENTITY You 're makin ' it up , 'cause in real life , ... we know exactly what 'd happen to that little birdy ! $ENTITY Soon as that bird 's done cleanin ' , $ENTITY the croc 'd gobble 'im up ! $ENTITY CHOMP ! $ENTITY Gah ha ha ha ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY Times like this help deepen the bonds between friends . $ENTITY Plus , $ENTITY you get to mooch some cake ! ... GAHAHA !

$ENTITY Amazing how fast a year goes by . $ENTITY December goes by the fastest ... . Everyone has somewhere to be . $ENTITY I 've been stressing about the fact that I ca n't just keep wasting my time anymore . $ENTITY I think I 'll get a fresh start on things and move to a new town ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY of next month sounds as good a day as any to hit the road ! $ENTITY No , do n't move ! Sounds like a plan .
$ENTITY It 's almost time for the big day ... . You know , that day when the bunny with the big head comes to town . He always shows up in the spring , ... .
$ENTITY But I 'm not good at making any of that stuff ! $ENTITY The only thing I 'm good at making is baked potatoes !

I AM a trendsetter , you know ! $ENTITY & lt ;
Oookaaaay ... It 's the chance of a lifetime , but whatever . $ENTITY Some other time , I guess , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY So , hey . Big news . $ENTITY I 'm moving away . $ENTITY I was hoping to leave in the summer , but you know me ... I 'm such a hopeless procrastinator . $ENTITY If I do n't move now , winter will be here and I 'll never go . $ENTITY So I 'm bound and determined . $ENTITY I 'm outta here . $ENTITY I 've even set myself a deadlinethe $ENTITY of next month . $ENTITY You 're stuck with me for a bit , but then I 'm gone ! $ENTITY & # xF ; Bummer !

The triangular teeth of sharks appear to have evolved from scales sometime in the past . When a tooth breaks , it quickly falls out and a new one grows in , keeping them always in good shape for prey . Sharks can be fearsome creatures , able to smell blood from several miles away . They can even jump out of the water to catch prey , making them powerful predators . Contrary to their tough image , their bones are made out of cartilage and erroneously used as health food .

, Mayor ! I was just trying my best to solve a dilemma . But I must admit , I 'm fairly stuck . Oh ! $ENTITY May I ask your thoughts on the matter ?
$ENTITY Letters can help you say things you ca n't say out loud , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY , I got you a present . It 's the perfect song , just for you : $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY
$ENTITY The other night , I went to one of $ENTITY K.K . Slider $ENTITY 's shows and requested $ENTITY Hypno K.K ... . And he performed it ! $ENTITY It was amazing to hear it done live ! $ENTITY If you really like his lesser-known work , $ENTITY you should ask him to play it .
$ENTITY Sweet ! $ENTITY I love making a deal ! ... So $ENTITY I 'll be taking that for $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY , OK ? ... ?
$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY Thanks a bunch for bringing me $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , a visitor already ? $ENTITY Good to meet ya ! I 'm $ENTITY !

$ENTITY I 've been thinking about redecorating one of my walls . $ENTITY Yeah , I want to replace my old $ENTITY with a new wall fixture of some sort . If you find anything like that , bring it to me , OK ?
So then , what will it be ? $ENTITY Still interested in buying the $ENTITY I 'll get it ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Aww , ... left ... out for us ... . I guess he does have a sensitive side !
$ENTITY Yo , ... I was just talking to $ENTITY about movies !
$ENTITY Uh , yeah ... . But who cares ? I like my PB without the J anyway !
$ENTITY Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What in the world $ENTITY are you walking around with ... ?
$ENTITY We should get going before $ENTITY gets tired of waiting .
$ENTITY What 's this all about , $ENTITY ? I do n't like being urgently summoned .
$ENTITY I ca n't wait for the $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY party tonight ! $ENTITY Everyone gathers together to drool over the moon 's beauty ! $ENTITY There 's something special about getting the first glimpse of that sparkly autumn moon , you know ?
$ENTITY Hmm ... I do n't really pay attention to little kids ' clothes , but ... I 'd say it 's totally gnarly ?
$ENTITY # x6 ;
You know , I never step on the $ENTITY I keep in here , $ENTITY . I like to think smart about food , ... but I refuse to let that darn scale taunt me with numbers !
$ENTITY I know ! $ENTITY I saw this look on the cover of $ENTITY Today 's Stylish ... and I just $ENTITY HAD to get it !
$ENTITY A cup of coffee , please . $ENTITY With $ENTITY 3 spoonfuls $ENTITY of sugar in it .

Oh my , $ENTITY did $ENTITY really pick this out for me ? ... It 's hard to believe $ENTITY he 's got such great taste in clothing !
$ENTITY `` Home cooking '' has a pretty nice ring to it . Yeah , sounds delicious ... Though in my case , I do just enough to keep from starving to death . $ENTITY That 's why I consider boiling water the finer art of cooking ! $ENTITY Do n't you think ? $ENTITY GAHAHA ! ...
What do you think , ... I feel like it 's the right size , but ... It looks good on you ! I think it looks OK . It looks a bit weird .
$ENTITY I see ... So you 'd like something fresh that also feels good ?
$ENTITY I really want to thank $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY for coming all the way to $ENTITY . It 's been a great $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's 14 !
$ENTITY Hey there ! ... It is SO nice to meet you ! $ENTITY I 'm the famous and talented $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I 'm sure $ENTITY has told you all about me . $ENTITY I met ... # x0 ; $ENTITY camping , and ... # x0 ; told me to move here ! $ENTITY Do you want $ENTITY to be friends with me ? $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY we 're gon na be neighbors and all , $ENTITY so we might as well !
This might technically be a fruit , $ENTITY but it 's not what I was after . $ENTITY I 'd crack my jaw before cracking it ! $ENTITY And it 's not even what I asked for ... .
ENTITY And , $ENTITY , by the wayyour house is as large as we can make it . We can not build it any larger . $ENTITY I trust this new information is all perfectly clear , hm ? $ENTITY Thanks much !
$ENTITY I would n't call them plans , per se ... . I 'm much too spontaneous for that . $ENTITY I just like spending time with the beautiful creatures of the world .
$ENTITY Brrr ! $ENTITY It 's so cold , $ENTITY I can barely feel my face ! $ENTITY But $ENTITY I guess I should n't complain . At least I do n't have to work on $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY like $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY does !
$ENTITY Any $ENTITY river fish $ENTITY will do ! $ENTITY Snag one and bring it to me , OK ? ... !
$ENTITY It might be cold , $ENTITY but I 'm feeling good ! $ENTITY Do you think chowing down on some ice cream would , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY freeze my head off ?
$ENTITY For fish , the best thing to do is saut it ! $ENTITY Yeah ! $ENTITY Pan fried is the way to go ! $ENTITY Lemon $ENTITY or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY will make it lip- smackingly good !
$ENTITY Thanks for the awesome gift , $ENTITY Santa . $ENTITY I totally swear I 'll take $ENTITY really good care of it !
$ENTITY Howdy ! $ENTITY I 'm ... I just moved here recently ! $ENTITY When I was camping here before , $ENTITY someone from this town invited me to move here ... But the person who invited me $ENTITY was already gone by the time I arrived ... It 's kind of sad , really ... But I ca n't dwell on that , not when I 'm having so much fun . $ENTITY I hope you and I can be friends ! $ENTITY See you around , ... !
... $ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY There 's a message written in small letters on the back of the photograph ...
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY that reminds me ! $ENTITY If you 're thinking about changing the look of your room , $ENTITY it 's best to talk to a pro . $ENTITY Saharah $ENTITY is in town , $ENTITY and I 've heard marvelous things about her .
$ENTITY When I drink coffee , $ENTITY I always have $ENTITY 3 $ENTITY sugars in it , ... Enjoying a hot , sweet coffee $ENTITY is the real $ENTITY style !
ENTITY Come back anytime , sugar !
$ENTITY If you want to grow a really vibrant garden this year , $ENTITY I 've got a little tip for you . $ENTITY Do n't just mix up your plants randomly . $ENTITY Try placing some of the same type near each other . $ENTITY That kind of arrangement leads to all sorts of interesting offspring . $ENTITY For example , $ENTITY two red lilies will sometimes produce a black lily ! $ENTITY You can thank me later .
$ENTITY Wait ! $ENTITY Do n't open that ! ... I was thinking about giving that to you later as a surprise present . $ENTITY But now I can give it to you early . That is , $ENTITY if you want it . It 's OK if you do n't . $ENTITY I love it ! Thanks , but ...
$ENTITY Pelican ? ! $ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY That 's a bold choice . $ENTITY The tough thing about keeping a pelican is ... I hear they have some pretty bad mood swings .
On a day like this , $ENTITY I feel like $ENTITY drinking some $ENTITY and letting myself relax a bit .
$ENTITY That was over quick , $ENTITY but hopefully you 're happy with the result , ... !
$ENTITY You be careful you do n't catch a cold too , ... .
$ENTITY Thanks for delivering that for me ... . I guess I should have done it myself , but I 'm glad you helped !
$ENTITY Have you figured out your New Year 's resolutions yet ? ... It 's OK if you have n't . Tonight should be about having fun ! $ENTITY There 's plenty of time tomorrow to think about resolutions !
$ENTITY I 've got ta get down $ENTITY and BOOGIE ! $ENTITY C'mon $ENTITY and dance with me !
$ENTITY I came in here for something ... but I do n't know what it was . $ENTITY Ugh . $ENTITY I do this all the time !
Sigh . $ENTITY I really ca n't handle it when a $ENTITY walks up to me . $ENTITY Just thinking about it now gives me the shivers . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Good morning , ... You 're up early , $ENTITY are n't you , ... ?
$ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY seriously . I 've noticed how careful you are about the way you dress , $ENTITY . That 's why I think this town got a whole lot more fab once you moved here , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY That $ENTITY K.K . Slider $ENTITY is such a talented dog ! And every $ENTITY I know agrees with me !
good ! $ENTITY Though , $ENTITY we ca n't break ground on your home until your down payment is received , hm ?
$ENTITY Hi there ! Hey , have you seen Mayor $ENTITY 's place yet ? $ENTITY It 's still just one story . $ENTITY The mayor must be spending a lot of time growing the town instead of building $ENTITY # x0 ; ... house !
$ENTITY You were pretty lucky ! $ENTITY Let 's play again sometime , ... !
$ENTITY Ow ! $ENTITY ... . All right , look , ... You need to watch where you 're swinging that thing ! ... It 's dangerous ! ...

I 'll have a $ENTITY Blue Mountain $ENTITY coffee , please !
$ENTITY No pressure or anything , $ENTITY but I am $ENTITY TOTALLY counting on you !
... what kinds of clothes do you like ? ... Hope you find some stuff that suits you !
ENTITY Oh dear ! $ENTITY This is troublesome ! $ENTITY If you have an accessory on , it 'll simply mess up your makeup . $ENTITY I 'd like to take it off , but ...
... You look delicious again today ! $ENTITY I 'm getting hungry again , ... .
$ENTITY See , $ENTITY it 's like I 'm sayin ' ! $ENTITY If you could say somethin ' to 'em , $ENTITY everythin ' would go a whole lot smoother ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY So just for me , huh ? $ENTITY OK ! I got it , ... I 'm blasting my abs for ME ! $ENTITY Each new ripple of muscle brings a tear of pride to my weary eye ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY What are you doing over here with that thing ? $ENTITY The water is that way . $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY you 're fishing for ... eh ? $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY You 're going to need some pretty exquisite bait ...
From the looks of it , it may stop raining before too long .
$ENTITY It 's fine right now , $ENTITY but later it 'll probably start up again ... The blockade called $ENTITY April Fools ' $ENTITY will be lifted , and mischief will pour into our quiet town !
$ENTITY Ha ... Er , I mean , $ENTITY I just thought your room would be a bit different than this , is all . $ENTITY You know , $ENTITY I 'm kinda relieved now that I see that , $ENTITY !
The official name given to this warm-water-dwelling species of fish is `` Garra rufa . '' They are omnivorous , as they both eat algae and scrape the skin off other fish . All you 'd have to do to feed them is stick your hand in the tank ; they would live off your dead skin . That 's why they 're called nibble fish . They exfoliate but do n't have any teeth , so it does n't hurt at all !
$ENTITY So she remembered I borrowed it ? $ENTITY Kinda rare for her to think about stuff like that , huh ? $ENTITY !
... treadmill-maintenance guy ? !
$ENTITY Thank you again !
$ENTITY So $ENTITY what do you think ? $ENTITY Looks good ! It 's all right . It 's kinda lame .
$ENTITY So ... stop scaring me ! $ENTITY I gave you some $ENTITY candy ... Prank over ! ...
$ENTITY But you know what ? $ENTITY I 'm going to keep it on awhile . $ENTITY After all , it was a present !
$ENTITY So right now I 'm trying to get my hands on some big furniture ! $ENTITY I mean , look around ... This place is like a barren wasteland ! $ENTITY The size of the room and the furniture are n't balanced at all ... And furniture needs more punch ! $ENTITY Which leads me to ask ... do you have any big pieces of furniture you 'd like to donate to the cause ? $ENTITY The type really does n't matter . $ENTITY !
I got the $ENTITY & # x1F ; $ENTITY badge ! ... # x0 ; of the $ENTITY Happy Home Academy $ENTITY !

$ENTITY I want ... treasures ! That 's it ! Do n't bring me anything else !
, $ENTITY so close ! $ENTITY It 's the same size as the current second-largest fish . $ENTITY Sorry , but early entries come first , $ENTITY so yours will be $ENTITY listed as the third- largest fish instead . Tough luck !
$ENTITY I suppose you did go out of your way to make the delivery . $ENTITY So I think you deserve some kind of reward ...
$ENTITY Oops ! $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY I 'm sorry ! $ENTITY My mind started to wander a bit , so I did n't realize it 's already $ENTITY ! $ENTITY It 's late , so ... let 's just get together another time , ... !

$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY I 'm thinking about playing a little hide-and-seek right now . $ENTITY Just be warned $ENTITY if you think hide-and-seek is something that 's only for kids , $ENTITY you 're dead wrong ! $ENTITY It 's a very intellectual game where the it and those hiding try to read each other 's minds ! $ENTITY What do you think ? ... Feel up to playing with us ? ... Yes ! Nope .
$ENTITY What do you think ? $ENTITY Do I look good or what ? $ENTITY You look awesome . It 's fine . It 's kinda lame ...

$ENTITY
$ENTITY When I visited your house , $ENTITY I thought this would match with everything ! ... I hope I 'm not way off on this one !
$ENTITY That shamrock hat of yours looks so cool ! $ENTITY It looks so good on you $ENTITY that $ENTITY I 'm starting to get a bit jealous ! ... !
$ENTITY OK , $ENTITY it 's the final round ! $ENTITY The flower is in either my right or left hand . $ENTITY Which hand will you choose ? ... Right hand , of course ! Left hand , of course !
$ENTITY Hey , ... We 're just taking a little break ! I mean , we 're always so busy working hard , you know ?
$ENTITY No problem . $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY the game is played with 3 cards . $ENTITY There 's a jack , $ENTITY a queen , $ENTITY and a king . I 'll shuffle the cards and then have you pick one . $ENTITY If you pick the queen , $ENTITY you win ! $ENTITY It 's as simple as that . $ENTITY Pick the queen 3 times in a row , and the $ENTITY is free ! $ENTITY If you pick the queen 1 or 2 times , $ENTITY then you 'll have to pay a little something for it . And if you ca n't manage to find the queen at all ... well ... then it 's going to cost you a pretty penny . I think that covers it ... So let 's get started ! $ENTITY Pick a card , $ENTITY any card . $ENTITY The left card . The middle card . The right card .
$ENTITY Aw , man . $ENTITY But I worked super hard putting this outfit together , ... ! $ENTITY That 's it ! $ENTITY If you do n't know what to think of this outfit , $ENTITY my next outfit is gon na totally blow your mind !

The round balloons are worth $ENTITY 1 point $ENTITY , and the bunny balloons are worth $ENTITY 3 points ... If you two can earn at least $ENTITY points $ENTITY in $ENTITY minutes $ENTITY , I 'll give you some medals .
$ENTITY This town is SO cute $ENTITY during the winter season . $ENTITY I feel like I 'm trapped $ENTITY inside a snow globe !

Snow crabs live in the deep sea and are known mostly as a highly prized winter delicacy . When cooked , the typically dark-red shell turns to the beautiful bright- red color most commonly seen .

Crucian carp are fairly easy fish for beginners to catch , but they 're also popular with veteran anglers . They are related to koi and can live up to 15 years , making them a great fish to keep in a pond . Male offspring are seldom born , so females significantly outnumber males , making populations suffer . Luckily , females can reproduce with males of some other species , so the problem is relatively temporary .

Killifish are small , travel in schools , and are known for having eyes higher up on their faces than others .

Pond smelt are small but vigorous fish that can survive in water of relatively poor quality . Pond smelt are related to salmon and as such have a lot of the same migratory tendencies .

They have small fins and are perfect for eating whole as tempura or grilled on barbecues .

$ENTITY Gosh . $ENTITY I 'd like to be able to give it to you for nothing , but ... I just ca n't . $ENTITY I know you 're interested in taking it , $ENTITY so I 'm really sorry , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Why do we need scorpions ? Maaan , I can understand spiders and bees , but scorpions ? No , thanks . $ENTITY
Loaches are rather small fish that make their habitats in rivers and muddy water . They have 10 whiskers around their mouths with taste buds built in for tasting sweetness and bitterness . Loaches can breathe through their intestines as well as their gillsa rather unique quality of the species . They push their mouths above the surface of the water to inhale , exhaling through their tail regions . Making stew with loaches and burdock root is known to improve stamina , or so people believe .
Things did n't turn out so well , $ENTITY but $ENTITY thanks for making the delivery !
$ENTITY Yep , yep . I know what you mean ! $ENTITY Right about that age when you want to act more grown up ! $ENTITY I remember thinking it tasted terrible but pretending to like it ! $ENTITY It 's weird . Once you 've faked it for a bit , you actually start to be able to drink it !

Guppies are tropical fish that are related to killifish and live in warm rivers . They are popular fish that have been bred to have beautiful flowing tail fins .

Football fish live in parts of the ocean so deep that light does not reach them . Their lanterns , which they sway back and forth to lure prey , can emit light thanks to special bacteria .

Males are small , less than two inches in length .

Sea bass are famous for their delicious white meat as well as their large size . If they ingest something inedible , they open up their mouths and gills and violently shake their heads . This generally manages to expel the foreign material , though it has the added effect of looking rather odd . Much like their freshwater cousins , sea bass have a strong pull , making them a great challenge for anglers .

$ENTITY I 'm so delighted ! We 're going to really hop to it and make a difference , $ENTITY . $ENTITY You 'll need to get $ENTITY signatures $ENTITY from $ENTITY other towns $ENTITY . $ENTITY Oh , and they should all be from $ENTITY rabbits $ENTITY . $ENTITY Here 's the sheet , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I should probably let you two go about your business and not snoop around while you 're working ... But that would n't be like me at all ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Is that all you wanted to know ? $ENTITY It 's really easy to keep your place organized . $ENTITY Just put stuff away ! $ENTITY The second you 're done using something , put it back where it belongs . $ENTITY Otherwise , $ENTITY you 'll forget ! Suddenly you 'll have a million things lying around the house and it gets overwhelming . $ENTITY Give my way a try !
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY Our destination is my house , not yours , remember ?
What ? $ENTITY Really ? ... Well , $ENTITY I guess tight spots can be cozy sometimes . $ENTITY Like , $ENTITY one spot I really like is $ENTITY the space $ENTITY between the bed and the wall .
Oh , are you not in the mood ? ... Well , promise me we 'll play some other time , ... .
$ENTITY I am $ENTITY SO stoked that $ENTITY Saharah $ENTITY is in town today ! $ENTITY She sure knows how to decorate a room , that one ! $ENTITY I 've been wanting to redecorate my place for a while now . $ENTITY Maybe she can help me $ENTITY find the perfect look !
$ENTITY Oh ho ! $ENTITY I did n't think I 'd have an audience ... But $ENTITY I suppose I could be persuaded . $ENTITY Here I go ! $ENTITY Yeah ! ... Cha ! $ENTITY CHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY
ENTITY By the way , this year 's lucky direction is $ENTITY west-southwest $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Lucky ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Every year when it 's time for $ENTITY Tsukimi $ENTITY , I 'm always reminded $ENTITY of how great the moon is ! $ENTITY Really makes you appreciate the fact that it 's not falling on our town anytime soon ! Uh , incidentally , you do n't have a flute or ocarina on you just in case , do you ? $ENTITY Ca n't be too careful ...
$ENTITY I actually $ENTITY have a little something for you . $ENTITY Here you go !
So ... are you here on a visit ? ... Nice to meet you ! $ENTITY I 'm ... It 's too bad we 're meeting now , $ENTITY because tomorrow I 'm moving to another town . $ENTITY Maybe we 'll meet again in some other place , ... .
... I wo n't forget your favor , as long as you do n't forget this present !
ENTITY What 's this ? $ENTITY Could it be $ENTITY this is your first time in our humble $ENTITY establishment ? $ENTITY Ooooh ! $ENTITY You 've already met my older brother , $ENTITY Timmy ... I hope you treat us both kindly ! $ENTITY Please do ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY I was cleaning when I found this old comic book I thought I 'd lost . $ENTITY Then I had to stop and read it . $ENTITY And then I had to have a snack and a nap . $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY my point is that I have n't gotten a whole lot of cleaning done yet , ... .
$ENTITY I guess I did lend you something like that , ... I remember it now ! $ENTITY Yeah ! But do n't you think it 's a little rude to make me come over here when you 're the one who forgot ... ? $ENTITY Oh well . I guess I 'll let this one slide .
What do you think of my outfit ? ... Since today is $ENTITY Shamrock Day $ENTITY , I just thought I 'd wear something green !
ENTITY In third place ... With a gorgeous $ENTITY -inch $ENTITY , it 's ... ...
ENTITY Are you confident with the results of today 's hunt ? $ENTITY I 'll be announcing the winners at the awards ceremony . It 's just about ready ! $ENTITY Please wait inside the tent .
$ENTITY Cooking is one of those grown-up skills I should have . $ENTITY But I 've been known to burn water ... $ENTITY I thought I 'd just collect kitchen gadgets for now ! $ENTITY No need to burn down my lovely home , right ?
$ENTITY I got ta practice giving birthday greetings ... So you need to just stand there and let me do it ! $ENTITY I 'm not used to this , $ENTITY so I figured it 'd help to do some trial runs ...
$ENTITY Was n't it ? $ENTITY Maybe you should be my muse .
$ENTITY What a coincidence , ... You seem to have some beans , $ENTITY and I have some as well ! $ENTITY All we need now is an ogre ...
... you 're joking ! $ENTITY I 'd know ... I personally think ... my room has become a travesty ! $ENTITY All the same , I do appreciate the kind words ! ... It makes me very happy indeed , $ENTITY !
I guess it 's time for some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY .
I caught a barred knifejaw ! I 'll have to use it to cut veggies ! ... in . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I love to rinse off my sweat in $ENTITY after working out . $ENTITY But then I just start working out again , and I get all sweaty again ! ... It 's a vicious cycle , ...
$ENTITY What are you ? ... 's gopher or something ? $ENTITY I wonder what that knucklehead wants with me ... $ENTITY Could it be ? ! ... Oh no ... Oh nonono ! $ENTITY OK ... I got ta calm down . $ENTITY All right . $ENTITY Time to face the music ! $ENTITY Take me there ! ... !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY The $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY celebration always makes me realize how quickly the year is going by . $ENTITY I mean , it 's already fall ! Where did the time go ? $ENTITY Heh . We moon gazers are such deep thinkers ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY My favorite food ? $ENTITY That 's your big question ? $ENTITY All right . $ENTITY If I had to say ... I prefer sophisticated food .
Hey , $ENTITY ! How did you do that trick ? $ENTITY Do n't act like you do n't remember ! You suddenly disappeared $ENTITY when we were walking together ! $ENTITY And then we could n't hang out ! $ENTITY It was a double whammy ! I 'm still in shock ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY AAAAAACHOO ! ... Hmm ? $ENTITY Could it be ... ? That you , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Heh . Long time no see ! Do you remember me ? ... We met that one time in that one town a while back ! $ENTITY Name 's $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Anyway , as you can tell , I 'm in a bit of a tight spot ...

$ENTITY Sorry you got dragged into this ! ... But thanks ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Man ... On damp days like this , my attitude follows suit ! ... I hate it ! $ENTITY If you wander outside when it 's like this , $ENTITY you 're basically guaranteed a shower ... !
How 's the town ? $ENTITY Has it changed much since I left , ... It 's changed ! It has n't changed . I do n't know .
$ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY was really fun ! $ENTITY Actually , I was looking forward to trying out $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking , but ... Next year I 'll have to try it for sure !

$ENTITY When the weather 's like this , $ENTITY there 's nothing like a tall glass of $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Heh heh ... It feels kinda strange to have you over here . $ENTITY Good , but strange . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Wow ! I have n't heard from $ENTITY I 'd love to meet up , but it kinda looks like you 're in the middle of something , $ENTITY . ... Why do n't you finish what you 're doing , and I 'll track down $ENTITY on my own .
$ENTITY You 're totally surprised , are n't you ! $ENTITY ... Are n't you ?
I wonder what was $ENTITY sooo important $ENTITY that $ENTITY just HAD to see me right away . $ENTITY Maybe $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; got a juicy secret to tell me ! $ENTITY !
It is n't clear , but it is n't raining ... What is up with this weather ? Just make up your mind !

$ENTITY # xC ; $ENTITY
$ENTITY Not as if you need an excuse like $ENTITY Boy 's Day ... but I hope you have a lot of fun playing in town today !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY yes ! Hello ! ... This is , $ENTITY um , $ENTITY the $ENTITY police station ... .
$ENTITY Seeing this $ENTITY made me remember something . $ENTITY said she showers at least once a day . $ENTITY But I always thought just washing your face once in a while was good enough , $ENTITY !

I ca n't believe you 're finally here ! $ENTITY I know you have n't done anything yet , but you will !

$ENTITY I 'd like to say that this cold does n't bother me . $ENTITY But it 's pretty bad ...
$ENTITY Did you notice $ENTITY that the fruit was all wormy , ... Well , no matter . $ENTITY I 've got a strong stomach , and I 'm always looking to try new , gross foods . $ENTITY AS IF ! ...

$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY The wrapping 's torn open ! $ENTITY You opened it , did n't you ? $ENTITY I worked really hard to make it look good . $ENTITY This was n't very nice of you , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Make yourself at home !
$ENTITY This should go up against the wall , $ENTITY and I 'll put that opposite it ... Wait a sec ! $ENTITY Am I gon na be able to get out if I do that ?
$ENTITY Hooray ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY has begun ! $ENTITY I 've checked my net for holes , and I 'm ready to go !
I wish we 'd had some of $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY 's cooking , $ENTITY but at least most of us in town made food . $ENTITY At next year 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival ... I hope there 's even more to feast on , ... .
$ENTITY Good evening $ENTITY , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I think I 'm going to freeze if I stay out much longer , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY For all that help , you deserve a nice gift , ... But it seems like your pockets are too full right now . $ENTITY I 'll send it to your house , OK ?

$ENTITY I 've got the ears of ...

$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY You do n't believe me ? ... Well , would I lie to you ? $ENTITY Do n't answer that ... . But this is the truth !
each town , there 's one model home representing the town , and it gets shown to everyone ! If you 'd like to change the house representing your town , the process is fairly simple . Whoever wants to have their home represent $ENTITY just needs to come speak to me about it .
$ENTITY I 'm so happy that we 're friends ! $ENTITY I 've always wanted a best friend , $ENTITY you see .
$ENTITY , $ENTITY I 'll let you get back to whatever it was you were doing before I stopped by ... . Ciao !
$ENTITY No , $ENTITY I got ta think this through ... The price may be good , but I do n't need more stuff THAT badly ... . $ENTITY I 'm not really into cheap stuff , $ENTITY so I think I 'll pass on the sale !
$ENTITY Neat ! $ENTITY I wan na catch ... and keep it in my house too ! Then $ENTITY it could be friends with $ENTITY 's $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yeah ... Who knows ? $ENTITY Maybe we 're just joined by some invisible bond . $ENTITY anyway ... Wait ... what ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY But I 'm stuck with it now . After all , $ENTITY gave it to me , so I would n't want to be rude .

$ENTITY Pretty sweet , huh ? ! $ENTITY I can play $ENTITY whenever I want ! $ENTITY Even in my pajamas !
$ENTITY Ahhhh ! $ENTITY There 's nothing better $ENTITY than relaxing in a stylish caf $ENTITY on a lovely Friday ...

$ENTITY The weather 's so nice , I figured there 'd be more people ... But maybe they just have better things to do . $ENTITY Ah , well . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 've come to a realization , $ENTITY . $ENTITY and I go together like ... . Well , a lot like $ENTITY and ... And they do n't go together ! So I 'm leaving $ENTITY on the $ENTITY of next month . $ENTITY I hope you understand , ... What ? Do n't move ! OK , bye .

It 's time to make a snowman ! $ENTITY You do n't know how to build one ? $ENTITY Well , it 's easy . $ENTITY Just start rolling up the snow , $ENTITY little by little . $ENTITY Be careful around the water ... and make one snowball at a time . $ENTITY When they 're the right size , $ENTITY stack 'em up ! I ca n't wait to see what kind of snowman you 'll build , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY It feels kind of weird seeing you in my room , ... .
... Hahahaha ! $ENTITY You got me ! $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY April Fools ' Day ... so I thought I 'd go for a whopper ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY You 're not very good at this , are you , ladybro ? ... The answer is your shadow !
When you sit on this $ENTITY , $ENTITY it chills your buns . $ENTITY It 's a chilly thrill ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY All right , $ENTITY if we 're done here , $ENTITY I should get back to my workout . $ENTITY I ca n't remember how many chin-ups I did ! $ENTITY It was either 500 ... or 5,000 ... . Oh well . $ENTITY I guess I 'll start over . $ENTITY See you two later !
$ENTITY So you decorate with gyroids too ? Yeah , it 's like having a nonstop party of weird noisemakers !

$ENTITY Huh ?

$ENTITY When you 're cooking seafood , $ENTITY you need to use a light touch in order to avoid overpowering the fish .

Yep ... one little drizzle adds a ton of sizzle . $ENTITY Just trust me ... It 's tastier than that rhyme .
$ENTITY Bees , maaan . Why they got ta hate ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , what a surprise ! You have ...

Tuna can reach almost 10 feet in length and weigh over 800 pounds , which is huge in the fish world . Combining this great size with their good flavor makes them literally the biggest catch for most anglers . Tuna ca n't breathe when they are n't moving , so their entire lives revolve around constantly swimming . To sleep , they merely slow down . This ability to swim while sleeping is a huge advantage . They 're also rather fast , capable of beating both sets of fins so hard they reach speeds of 50 mph .
$ENTITY Hmmm . $ENTITY If we were talking about anyone else , I 'd assume it was just a joke , but ... Dude ! $ENTITY This is making me nervous now , $ENTITY !
I hope you enjoyed the ... Tell your friends !

$ENTITY Good morning , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe you dragged yourself out of bed this early to visit me .

$ENTITY Why , $ENTITY we keep running into each other , $ENTITY do n't we , ... You should pace yourself . $ENTITY It 's going to be an extra-sunny day today , ... .
Aw , $ENTITY that 's it for this year 's $ENTITY fireworks shows ... I kind of feel empty now .
$ENTITY Welcome to $ENTITY 's room ! $ENTITY Please make yourself at home ! $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY not that I should be the one saying that , but anyway ... .
Now then ... If you want to dream , $ENTITY please lie down over there on the $ENTITY bed ... However , if you want to share a dream of this town , $ENTITY please lie down on the $ENTITY couch $ENTITY at the back ...
$ENTITY Hmmm . OK. $ENTITY If you say I should buy it , $ENTITY I know I should buy it . $ENTITY Since I 'm getting your hand-me- down , $ENTITY it 's almost like you 're my big ... .
$ENTITY I 'm really in an awful way ... .
$ENTITY Let 's play again !
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY My ... I did n't really have a good place for it , $ENTITY so I just stuffed it in there . $ENTITY Since I do n't have room , $ENTITY would you like to have it ? $ENTITY I 'll take it ! No , thanks .
Bleh ... I 'm feeling kind of queasy ...
$ENTITY Let 's make $ENTITY a great year for both of us !
ENTITY Boingity boing ! $ENTITY Hello there ! $ENTITY Spring has sprung , hippity flipper ! I 'm the lucky spring bunny , so call me $ENTITY Zipper ... Yaaaay ! ... Let 's all clap !
ENTITY Well , I believe that 's all from me ! ... I hope you enjoy your time in the HH Showcase !
$ENTITY Hey , it 's been a bit since our last chat , right ? We should get together more often , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's nice that you 're so polite , $ENTITY but you can still call me ... The first thing you should work on is expressing your opinion in a diplomatic manner . $ENTITY If I am offered anchovies , $ENTITY I will say : `` No thank you . $ENTITY I do not care for anchovies . '' Now you try telling me that you do n't want something .
$ENTITY It 's weird , but people all over the world live under the same moon . $ENTITY Think about that tonight as we celebrate $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
I 'm surprised that $ENTITY has ... But I think it just shows that deep down inside , $ENTITY she 's a real softie .
All right . $ENTITY Well , let me know the next time you 're free , ... .
ENTITY I 'm dreadfully sorry ! $ENTITY It does n't appear you have anything in your belongings we can accept ... Our store can accept the following : some $ENTITY furniture ... clothing ... creatures ... fossils ... shells ... plants ... and $ENTITY fruit ... I 'm afraid we can not accept $ENTITY turnips ... works of art ... trash $ENTITY , or ... tools $ENTITY , so we ask for your cooperation ! $ENTITY We do ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hmm ? $ENTITY Have we ever met ? $ENTITY I 'm ... Nice to meet you ! ... Thing is , I 'm actually putting this town behind me starting tomorrow . $ENTITY I suppose you never know when you 'll meet someone new ... Well , $ENTITY I suppose I do n't have the right to say this , $ENTITY but I 'm gon na ! $ENTITY I hope you 'll make $ENTITY a fun place !
$ENTITY
about $ENTITY one of these ... relaxing dreams ?
Oh dear me ... That is indeed a problem ... In that case , why do n't you buy one of the ones we keep here at the town hall for situations like this ... ?
A scrap of gold-colored paper ... It reads , `` I wish to be the mayor/ boss/big kahuna of everywhere . ''
$ENTITY Heh . Thanks for being honest . $ENTITY I should be glad my catchphrase is still hot , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY has ... It 's actually pretty sweet !
$ENTITY So many happy memories ! $ENTITY Every so often , I miss living in ... Hey , the $ENTITY is still kinda popular here , right , ... ?
$ENTITY Ha ha ! $ENTITY Playing tricks is fun ! $ENTITY If you become a henchman of $ENTITY Jack $ENTITY 's too , everything will be even more fun ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Lately $ENTITY and $ENTITY have been fighting like cats and dogs ! $ENTITY Deep down , $ENTITY I think they both want to be friends again , $ENTITY but they just ca n't be honest with each other . $ENTITY It seems complicated , $ENTITY but given the right opportunity , $ENTITY I 'm sure they 'll make up .
ENTITY This $ENTITY is $ENTITY D ... E- $ENTITY LI- $ENTITY CIOUS ! ... BUU $ENTITY RRP ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY This might seem random , but $ENTITY do you know what I 'm thinking about right now ? ... The future . Yesterday .
$ENTITY Wan na know why I have so many cardboard boxes ? $ENTITY For all of my fan letters , of course ! $ENTITY Hee hee !
$ENTITY Really ? ! $ENTITY Great ! $ENTITY I knew I could count on you , $ENTITY . Let 's trade !
But it looks like you do n't have enough money .
$ENTITY I 've prepared special gifts just for $ENTITY Shamrock Day $ENTITY , $ENTITY so would you like to take one home with you ?
$ENTITY I have arrived ! $ENTITY Now tell me why you called me here , $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY that settles it then ! ... Once I break camp , $ENTITY I 'll be going home to pack for my move to $ENTITY !
... How can ... # x0 ; be so insensitive and just send this back without wrapping it up ... ? $ENTITY At least put it in a bag or a sack or something , you know ? ... What am I , $ENTITY dust upon $ENTITY shoes ? ! I suppose there 's no point in venting at you ... . Anyway , thank you very much , ...
ENTITY This item is being sold to celebrate the completion of our lovely fossil collection !
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Did you really catch ... ? ! $ENTITY This is so super cool ! ... Can I really have it ?
$ENTITY I love getting them too ! $ENTITY It 's fun to chat face-to-face , $ENTITY but I like being able to read my favorite letters more than once .
$ENTITY Oh , I know ! ... It 's kind of sudden , $ENTITY but do you want to come to my house right now ? $ENTITY You can see what kind of guy I truly am by seeing the place where I hang my hat ! What do you think ? $ENTITY I like that idea ! I 'm not interested .
$ENTITY I have an idea ! $ENTITY Let 's team up and train at your house today . $ENTITY Heh , to be honest , I 've just always wanted to see your place . $ENTITY What do you say ? $ENTITY Sure ! Come on over ! No . My hair hurts .
$ENTITY 's room is very relaxing , ... . $ENTITY I bet it 's because the room $ENTITY is filled with negative ions ... Heh . I mean , ... filled with $ENTITY 's charm and grace !
$ENTITY What ? You 're not ready ? You did n't get any $ENTITY candy $ENTITY for today yet ? $ENTITY Well , you really do need some ! $ENTITY Today 's Halloween ! $ENTITY You might think about dressing up to scare some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY out of folks , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Have you seen ... Those sheets look $ENTITY nice and starched ! $ENTITY If I slept on something as comfy as that , it 'd be $ENTITY WAY difficult rolling out of bed in the morning !
well . Maybe someone else will want it .
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Hey , ... Do n't go around peeking in my personal belongings ... Ah ! $ENTITY My $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY Ooh , the memories are starting to flash back ... $ENTITY Bad memories ! $ENTITY Take the $ENTITY away from me ! Please ! $ENTITY OK ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY Is it really OK for me to take this ? $ENTITY Right on ! $ENTITY Thank you , $ENTITY ! I feel weird , but ... yeah ... Thanks ! $ENTITY I do n't want to owe you anything , so ... I 'll find a way to pay you back !
In the past , $ENTITY while I was still living in ... I knew a person named $ENTITY You wan na know what kind of person ... # x0 ; is ? ... # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; a person who looks just like me ! ... Nah , I 'm just kidding ! $ENTITY I 'm sure $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; doing well , $ENTITY though . $ENTITY I hope $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; still ... That 's how I remember ... # x0 ; $ENTITY best .
Ugh ... If this cold were a boxer , I would punch it right in the knee !
$ENTITY For necessities or furniture , go to $ENTITY Timmy $ENTITY and $ENTITY Tommy $ENTITY 's store , $ENTITY Super T & amp ; T $ENTITY . For clothes , you want $ENTITY Able Sisters ... Man , there are just so many shops on Main Street . Plus , the stuff for sale changes daily . $ENTITY You should check it out every day !
Golden stags are named after their unique gold color and are highly prized by collectors . They shine like gold when their bodies are dry , but when it 's humid , they actually look black . Golden stags have short mandibles that are n't good for fighting , but males sometimes fight for territory . The males are surprisingly friendly to the females , which gives these beetles a likable quality .
$ENTITY The other day , $ENTITY asked me to take something over to $ENTITY 's house . $ENTITY Those two are always giving each other presents ! ... They get along so well , do n't they . $ENTITY To be honest , $ENTITY I 'm a little jealous .
Oof ! $ENTITY I think I overdid it on all the $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY food . So $ENTITY # x7 ; $ENTITY num-nums !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Santa really does bring gifts to all the good boys and girls .
$ENTITY Sorry . $ENTITY I get just a little bit competitive at times . $ENTITY Good game !
$ENTITY You can find that equipment at the $ENTITY supermarket $ENTITY on our main street , $ENTITY you know .
$ENTITY Oh , good ! $ENTITY I guess he does n't sweat the little things , like how long someone 's been borrowing his stuff .
Ugh ... Rumors can be frightening . $ENTITY The other day I heard a story , and it was full of semi-incorrect info . $ENTITY According to the story , I 'm a prince from another planet ! That 's a tough spot to be put in ! $ENTITY I mean , who can live up to that ? It sounds like an epic story dreamed up by a little kid , ...
$ENTITY But for you ... $ENTITY I 'm knocking the price down to $ENTITY Bells ... How about it ? $ENTITY You 're not gon na let a deal like this pass you by , are you ? $ENTITY I 'm in . I 'll let it pass me by .
Man ... I have my eye on the ... but the price is steep . What should I do ? $ENTITY Buy it ! Save your Bells .
$ENTITY Seriously ? ! $ENTITY Man , I did n't think you 'd go for it . $ENTITY But thanks !
$ENTITY Um , $ENTITY . Mayor ? ! $ENTITY P-please $ENTITY w-wait for me !
$ENTITY Look at you , $ENTITY big winner ! $ENTITY I totally knew you could do it . $ENTITY So $ENTITY are we gon na celebrate or what ?

$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY this is n't your favorite type of $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY tough twinkles . $ENTITY I ca n't stand your hat . $ENTITY Get out !
$ENTITY You ca n't take me to $ENTITY 's place , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You should be playing $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY # x0 ; t $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY to your company ! $ENTITY Out-of-town visitors $ENTITY are much more important $ENTITY than little ol ' me ! $ENTITY I 'll head over to $ENTITY 's place later .
$ENTITY
, so what 's going on , $ENTITY ?
The country I was headed for is sorta famous for a statue called the Manneken Pis ! $ENTITY I 'd be a little ashamed to be seen doing something like he does in public . $ENTITY He sure is gutsy for a kid ! $ENTITY But you ca n't forget the most important thing : ... the chocolate from this country is delicious ! $ENTITY This place has lots of restaurants , $ENTITY and since I 'm such a foodie , $ENTITY I 'm sure I 'll be stopping in each one of them ! Or maybe not . $ENTITY I have a sensitive stomach , $ENTITY so I always make sure to stop before I get too full ... . $ENTITY Anyway , that 's what that place is like . $ENTITY Does it ring a bell ?
$ENTITY It 's finally here ! The $ENTITY Bug-Off ... Yeah ! $ENTITY I might not be the best bug catcher around ... but I still get pumped up for a big tournament like this !
$ENTITY What happened to you ? ! ... Did you break every bone in your body ? ! $ENTITY I suppose if it 's just a fashion statement , $ENTITY that 's OK. $ENTITY I was just worried you 'd hurt yourself .
$ENTITY Have you ever heard that before ? $ENTITY Humming that tune makes me feel so alive !
... You came to play ! $ENTITY I have n't been living in $ENTITY for long , ... . $ENTITY And what a relief it is to finally have everything unpacked ... . I hope you come by my place often !
$ENTITY Chilly morning to you $ENTITY ! Snow days are , like , the BEST ! $ENTITY Even if my nose is totes freezing !
$ENTITY Ten ... HUT ! $ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY why did n't you salute me ? $ENTITY I demand respect in an outfit like this ! $ENTITY Just kidding , ... Sometimes it 's fun to dress up in clothes like this and go around saluting people .
Well , $ENTITY if it is n't you ! $ENTITY How are you on this refreshing day ?
$ENTITY Do you visit this town a lot ? $ENTITY This is the sort of place $ENTITY you want to keep coming back to , ... .
... I 'm always surprised by the stuff you come up with ... . $ENTITY I would never have thought of something like this myself ! ... Awesome !
! ... Welcome to the handmade- fashion palace of the $ENTITY Able Sisters ... Are you , $ENTITY by any chance , the new mayor everyone 's talking about ... Oh , everyone around town has been buzzing about you , so you were quite easy to recognize !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I guess I dropped it by accident while walking outside , huh ? $ENTITY This is actually my autobiography . It 's a work in progress for now . $ENTITY My birthday , $ENTITY favorite foods ... Yes , it 's quite a fascinating read . $ENTITY Very sophistimocated .
$ENTITY You 'll do it for me ? ! $ENTITY What a relief ! $ENTITY We 'll need $ENTITY B ... # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; r $ENTITY # x0 ; ... # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; ... # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; r $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY from $ENTITY rabbitlike folks ... Heretake this petition form !

$ENTITY The food cooked by $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY was really good , $ENTITY but I felt like there was something missing . $ENTITY If they at least had some soup ... Also , $ENTITY if I can ask for more , maybe some cake would be nice !
$ENTITY Good news ! $ENTITY I decided not to move away after all ! $ENTITY said it would be too sad to not have my muscles around to admire all day long ... So I 'm pretty much here for the long haul , I guess ! $ENTITY Be seeing you ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh ? $ENTITY I feel like I 've seen this thing somewhere before ... Ah , that 's right ! ... I have this exact piece in my room already ! $ENTITY And I do mean EXACT ! ... ! Sorry , but I ca n't accept this . $ENTITY If possible , $ENTITY I 'd prefer something I DO N'T already own ...

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by a selection like this , ... ? $ENTITY Me either ! $ENTITY Bring on the bargains !
$ENTITY Besides , you did tell me you opened it , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Fall makes me a little sad around the edges , $ENTITY . I know ! Me ? ! A little sad ? Ca n't happen ! But it does ... .

Oh , oops ! $ENTITY I drifted off in thought for a moment . $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY it 's you ! $ENTITY Did you know I live in $ENTITY now ? $ENTITY I 'm excited about being your new neighbor .

$ENTITY Did you know that tonight is $ENTITY Tsukimi ... We 're gon na stare at the moon $ENTITY and eat dango rice cakes ! $ENTITY I hope the moon hurries up and gets here soon , ... !
$ENTITY Yay ! Today was the best day ever ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY Fishing Tourney $ENTITY is one of my favorite competitions ! $ENTITY I hope the next tourney is as heated as this one was ! $ENTITY !
These fish are so small , they can fit their entire body in the palm of your hand . During mating season , the male 's belly turns a light orange in order to properly attract a mate . They live in rivers and lakes and deposit eggs in large bivalves where the eggs hatch and live for a while .
$ENTITY When $ENTITY I 'm ... way $ENTITY from $ENTITY me $ENTITY sweet $ENTITY lit $ENTITY tle $ENTITY ba $ENTITY by $ENTITY girl , $ENTITY I $ENTITY see $ENTITY her $ENTITY sweet $ENTITY face . $ENTITY She 's $ENTITY a $ENTITY real $ENTITY pearl . $ENTITY She 's $ENTITY a $ENTITY real $ENTITY pearl . $ENTITY

$ENTITY I 'm so bummed there is n't an awards ceremony for the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY this time ! It got canceled !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Medals are n't everything . $ENTITY You 'll get 'em next time !
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Way to make it here , guys .
Fossilized dung might not sound too exciting , but coprolites are a treasure trove of information . If they contain seeds , bones , or scales , you can gain insight into the animal 's natural diet . Dung does n't easily turn into fossils , so they 're considered quite precious and hard to come by .
do you want to talk about , $ENTITY ?
Really ? $ENTITY B-but ... I 've been so worried about what they would think , I 've hardly eaten ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY But $ENTITY if I may be frank , $ENTITY I was surprised to see someone as young as you step off the train . $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY our former mayor held the position for many , many years and was quite set in his ways . $ENTITY But youth is a breath of fresh air . And exactly the new image our town needs ! $ENTITY You 're perfect for the job !
$ENTITY I knew you 'd say yes ! Let 's play a little game of $ENTITY # x0 ; Made Ya Look ...

$ENTITY Good morning $ENTITY ! Ooh , I just LOVE saying that . $ENTITY Good morning $ENTITY !
You know , I keep a tidy house , but my $ENTITY is the one place where I 'm messy .
$ENTITY Brrr ... Winter camping is so cold ! $ENTITY I really should exercise at times like this to keep my body as warm as possible ! ... !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Yo , ... Calling me over like this ... What 's the big idea ? $ENTITY Depending on what it is , $ENTITY the next few minutes could get interesting ...
ENTITY GRAAAH ! ... I CA N'T TAKE IT ! ... `` TAP TAP TAP ! '' ... `` TAP TAP TAP ! '' ... BRAIN ... HURTS ! ... # x2 ; What ya got against buttons ? ! $ENTITY # x2 ; $ENTITY They did n't reset your game ! YOU DID ! $ENTITY I counted $ENTITY button taps ! You know how many times that is ? ! ... TOO MANY ! ... You think your thumbs got some sort of unlimited mashin ' powers ? ! ... 'Cause they do n't ! $ENTITY Give 'em a rest ! $ENTITY Enough $ENTITY is enough . $ENTITY I 'm all outta get- up-and-go juice . $ENTITY You can hit the road , pal . Scram already . $ENTITY Just show a little dignity ... and stop resettin ' !

ENTITY Well then , $ENTITY should I switch from Internet to local wireless ? $ENTITY OK ! Nah .

$ENTITY D- $ENTITY did you find something ? ! $ENTITY Oh , it 's just my ... I was thinking about recycling it . $ENTITY You can have it if you want it . $ENTITY I 'll take it ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Hooray ! $ENTITY I wonder what it is ! $ENTITY Should I shake it first ? $ENTITY Or smell it ? $ENTITY Oooh , $ENTITY I 'm just going to open it right now !
$ENTITY I bet if I lived in a town $ENTITY as awesome as this one , I 'd be $ENTITY SOOO much more satisfied $ENTITY with my amazing life . $ENTITY Then move here ! Whatever you say .
$ENTITY There are times in your life when you got ta throw caution to the wind ! ... And that 's this year for me ! $ENTITY I mean , $ENTITY is only gon na be here for 12 months , right ? So let 's make it great ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Your enthusiasm is catching . $ENTITY Maybe we can discuss it later .
$ENTITY So you like just a tiny bit of light , $ENTITY huh ? $ENTITY I like that too ... . It makes everything sooo chill , ... .
$ENTITY Woohoo ! And woohoo , part two $ENTITY ! $ENTITY You braved the snow to come and visit ? $ENTITY Well , do n't catch a cold now !
$ENTITY Do you believe that ? ... Now I 'll never leave ... My fans are too sweet !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY you think you can stop me ? ! ... I suppose it ca n't be helped if you feel that way ... . $ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY I take back everything I just said about moving ! $ENTITY I 'll stick around to enjoy life in $ENTITY a little while longer !
... . The Netherlands ? ... Yes ! $ENTITY That 's the place ! $ENTITY It 's all coming back to me ! $ENTITY Man , $ENTITY I was worried for a moment there . $ENTITY The ideas were $ENTITY spinning around my head like a windmill . $ENTITY I 'm grateful to you ! $ENTITY Very grateful ! $ENTITY I 'll think of you when I 'm in the tulip fields of the Netherlands !
$ENTITY I 'm sure I 'm way stronger than any fake me could ever be ! $ENTITY But since the impostor is gone , I suppose I ca n't prove it to you . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY

I 'm usually super sleepy in the mornings ... . Except for mornings when $ENTITY comes to visit .
$ENTITY Oof ... $ENTITY Howdy , ... Does bad weather make you sleepy too , ... ?
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe my prank did n't work ! $ENTITY I guess you 'll be getting off easy today , $ENTITY .
Since I want as many people as possible to come play on the island , I 've been talking to people in town . But everyone says they 're so busy with work , they ca n't come ! $ENTITY Say , $ENTITY Brewster ... You should rest those wings of yours on my island from time to time ! It 'd be good !
$ENTITY What ? It 's like you put a big ol ' NO stamp on my bright-pink forehead ! $ENTITY I ca n't believe you 'd say no like that without even listening to what kind of place I want to open up . That 's ... just awful ... .
$ENTITY Someone help me ! $ENTITY
Uh ... is it possible ... that he sleeps in here sometimes ... ?

$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY you took the time to bring this all the way out to me , $ENTITY so I should thank you somehow ! $ENTITY Here . Why not take my old $ENTITY ?

$ENTITY in $ENTITY 's house ? Color me totally astounded ! $ENTITY I just ca n't imagine $ENTITY with , like , a giant collection of stuffed animals !
$ENTITY You ca n't have $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY without a hot , lemony bath ! $ENTITY If you can hold your breath under the hot , lemony water for over 10 seconds , you wo n't catch a cold ! $ENTITY What ? ! You 're saying it should be enough to just soak in the hot , lemony water ? $ENTITY Ha ha ! That 's a boring way to build a cold-busting body ! ...
$ENTITY What 's going on ?
$ENTITY OK , $ENTITY if you say so .
One ... $ENTITY Two ... Rock . Scissors . Paper .
$ENTITY Hey , I 'm way excited , $ENTITY . I 've decided that it 's time to change my catchphrase ! $ENTITY You know how I say `` $ENTITY `` all the time ? $ENTITY Yup , I 'm so sick of it . What do you think ? $ENTITY Yeah , let 's change it ! It 's fine that way .

Do you know someone from this town named $ENTITY # xE ; ... # x0 ; gave me the suggestion to move all the way from $ENTITY to this town . $ENTITY So $ENTITY that 's why I 'm here ! ... It 's good seeing you again ! ... !

$ENTITY Some people drink coffee because it helps them stay alert . $ENTITY But you have to be careful not to overdo it . Coffee can rev you up like a race car . $ENTITY And you know what happens when you rev a race car too fast !
$ENTITY Whew ! Made it here ! $ENTITY So what do you need , $ENTITY
The sabertooth tiger was about the size of a lion and is famous for its two long canine teeth . It would prey mostly on woolly mammoths , but climate change made that difficult . Eventually , the changing climate and competition with humans for food drove these creatures to extinction .
$ENTITY What ? Wait a second ... . This fruit is all wormy and stuff ! Why would you make me eat this ? ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY 's home is so tranquil ... . Her $ENTITY fits in perfectly !
$ENTITY Awesome ! $ENTITY Thanks ! $ENTITY This is proof that there really is a Santa !
$ENTITY More importantly , $ENTITY tomorrow is the last $ENTITY fireworks show $ENTITY of the year ! $ENTITY I 'm sad they 're already almost over ! $ENTITY It 's like summer is ending as well ! $ENTITY I hope they make this last one even better than the others ! You know , a nice finale ! ... !

$ENTITY I wanted to have a white holiday $ENTITY but did n't expect such heavy snow ... Jingle $ENTITY does n't know when to stop !

$ENTITY Wow ! ... I ca n't seem to bump into anyone else today , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Special move ... Like a forbidden technique that knocks you out when you use it ?
$ENTITY
How did it go ? $ENTITY say anything important ? $ENTITY Actually ... Sorry . I forgot .
$ENTITY Walking through the cherry blossoms at night is just the best , ... !

The quilt on ... smells like ... I bet he snacks in bed all the time .
$ENTITY Really ? ! ... Hmmm ... You probably have the right idea . $ENTITY I guess you only see the bright side of $ENTITY when you 're camping . $ENTITY .
, please be quiet during the performance ! $ENTITY Hush now !
$ENTITY What 's the rush , ... ? $ENTITY Let 's take our time $ENTITY and smell the roses !
$ENTITY Of course $ENTITY has ... I 'm sure he sits in it and practices yelling at kids to stay off his lawn .
It 's a $ENTITY newsprint helmet ... Since it 's all part of the event , why do n't you wear one , Mayor ? It 'll be a whole lot of fun !
$ENTITY You ca n't talk about $ENTITY Chuseok $ENTITY without mentioning $ENTITY songpyeon $ENTITY , a very delicious rice cake ! $ENTITY Hmmm ... I wonder how many carbs those things have ...
$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Whoa ! Haha ! $ENTITY Mysterious ! $ENTITY What kinda secret can you find with a shovel ? ! $ENTITY Be careful not to hurt yourself , I guess ! $ENTITY !
You 're right ... After all , this is really something I should take care of in person , huh ? Thanks , ... !

$ENTITY Oh ! ... ! It really is you ! $ENTITY Nice ! $ENTITY You never talk to me , $ENTITY so I almost forgot what you look like ... . Do you remember me ? $ENTITY C'mon ... it 's me , ... Remember ? We go way back to that one time ? ... Heh , I used to camp here , and then $ENTITY was all , `` Dude , you need to move here ! '' $ENTITY So I did ! $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY I 'll probably be living here for a while , so you 'll remember me eventually , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY The other day I met someone named $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; not from around here . $ENTITY We did n't really hit it off ... # x0 ; was a bit of $ENTITY , $ENTITY if you ask me . $ENTITY But I wo n't write someone off based on a first impression . $ENTITY I would n't have many friends if I did !

$ENTITY This might seem out of the blue , but I want to tell you how much I look up to you . $ENTITY You 're the whole package : $ENTITY smart , stylish , and charming ! ... Everyone in town thinks so !
Ribbon eels have long , ribbonlike bodies and look as if they have flowers sprouting from their noses . They get their name from their bright , vivid color , in addition to the length of their skinny bodies . Ribbon eels hatch sexless before first becoming males , then females as they age . Their tendency to stick their heads out from holes in the sand and open their mouths is not a sign of anger . In actuality , they 're merely taking a breath . Oddly , they 're surprisingly peaceful creatures , despite the look .
$ENTITY Hmmm ... I just watch those on television ! $ENTITY If you watch on TV , you can see how their muscles are moving ! It 's great research !
$ENTITY I 've heard that keeping a plant in the house has healing effects . $ENTITY I 'm sure $ENTITY was thinking about that when she got it ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Hmm . $ENTITY Not going for it ? $ENTITY I thought it sounded like a pretty great idea ... .
$ENTITY What are we going to do ? $ENTITY I know ! ... I 'm confident you know which one of us is real $ENTITY and which is the impostor . $ENTITY Of course ! Not likely .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY I was just admiring your old ... Actually , $ENTITY I think I might buy it . $ENTITY Yes , do ! No , do n't !
$ENTITY Yo , ... Walkin ' around at night like this ... Makes ya feel pretty cool , huh ?

$ENTITY It 's from my pal ... Wonder how $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY doing . $ENTITY Reading a letter from another town is almost like taking a trip to that place ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's already ... ? ! ... Oh no ! $ENTITY I need to finish my chores ! ...
$ENTITY You know , there 's a fruit that grows in other towns , $ENTITY . It 's the $ENTITY . I have n't eaten one in ages . I feel like its elusive juice will restore my powers of dance ! Could you possibly bring me ... Yes , of course . Sorry , no .
, we 're ready to move on !
$ENTITY Hmmm ... Yeah , I guess that 's an OK assessment for now . $ENTITY I mean , you do n't wan na be too arrogant , right ?
$ENTITY What is it ? $ENTITY Your request sounded urgent , $ENTITY
Aha ! $ENTITY Do n't tell me ... You 're the one who just moved in here , right ? ... Good to meet you ! $ENTITY I 'm ... There 's a lot to get used to in this town , so do n't hesitate to find me and check in once in a while . $ENTITY I know a ton about this place , so I 'm sure I can help you ! ... !

$ENTITY It 's $ENTITY April Fools ' Day ... I feel like something will likely happen ... I got ta be careful , $ENTITY especially after all town visitors have left and it 's just us $ENTITY natives !
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY this present proves that she must have really done some major soul searching ! I guess I $ENTITY should go say sorry too !
$ENTITY Would you look at the fancy ... has ... I 'd expect nothing less from her ! $ENTITY I 'm no good with fancy technology and things like this , $ENTITY so I got ta give respect to anyone who can !
$ENTITY Heya ! Good to see you again ! $ENTITY You 're not getting all distracted by how cold it is , $ENTITY are you ? $ENTITY You 've got to push through the icy pain , $ENTITY ! It 's all worth it , 'cause cold gives you rosy cheeks !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY hey , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Looks like you found $ENTITY for me .
$ENTITY I 'm moving tomorrow ... But now that I think about it , $ENTITY sure has a lot of characters ! $ENTITY Things might be hectic sometimes , but life sure is fun here ! $ENTITY I hope I have a similar experience in my next town ... Do n't go ! You 'll be fine !

I caught a horseshoe crab ! $ENTITY Its luck has run out ! ... in . $ENTITY
$ENTITY What ? ! I 'm being summoned ? ! Ugh ... Even though I do n't think I 've done anything wrong , hearing that gives me the willies ! $ENTITY OK ! So I just need to go to $ENTITY 's place , right ? $ENTITY Maybe you should come too . $ENTITY For backup ! ...
you find someone suspicious or a model home that 's rather inappropriate for public display ... . $ENTITY be sure to ask that person to leave . $ENTITY You can also check the sign next to the home and request that it no longer be displayed in our town . When doing so , you can choose if the offensive person or home should be removed temporarily or forever . If the user is removed temporarily , he or she can return once you tag them via StreetPass again . If you choose to $ENTITY block $ENTITY the user forever , well , that 's quite different . $ENTITY He or she wo n't be displayed in the showcase ever again , even if you tag them in the future . Please be aware that it may prevent you from seeing that same player 's content in other games as well .
Oh , $ENTITY I bet you can help me with a serious problem . A package was delivered to my house . But it 's not mine ! It was supposed to be delivered to $ENTITY Everyone will say I took it from $ENTITY 's mailbox ! $ENTITY You KNOW how people talk ! Will you please return it for me , ... ?
$ENTITY Hey ! I 've been waiting for you guys ... . and $ENTITY , $ENTITY come on in and relax !
$ENTITY That MUST be one of $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY 's hats , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Yikes , $ENTITY I 'm getting dizzy ... I think I need to sit down . $ENTITY Strangely enough , $ENTITY the more I look at it ... the more I like it . $ENTITY That 'll be the hypnotic effect kicking in , $ENTITY I suppose .

These tough fish have very long life spans , capping out at ages surpassing 100 years . Their whiskers are one of their trademark features , making them relatively easy to identify . They 're omnivorous and eat waterweed and bugs by sucking their food into their mouths . They also have teeth in the back of their throats that help break down shellfish for digestion .

Barbel steeds have a longer distance between their eyes and mouths than carp do . This makes them look almost like they 're averting their eyes downward in embarrassment .

$ENTITY A gimmick , huh ? Most pop stars are desperate for attention . $ENTITY Maybe you could be all reclusive instead ! $ENTITY Refuse to do any interviews or let anyone take your photo . $ENTITY It 'll drive your fans crazy $ENTITY they 'll adore you !
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY You were the one who opened it ? $ENTITY Why would someone do something like that ?

$ENTITY I came outside because I wanted to take in the pure white scene that 's overtaken ... ! $ENTITY I only have so long to get this done before I see $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY and my mind becomes fixated on presents ...
$ENTITY GAHAHA ! ...

Horsehair crabs get their name from their spiky hairs , which can hurt , though they have soft shells . They inhabit the bottom of fairly shallow waters , with their biggest predator being the octopus . They camouflage themselves by putting dirt on their hair so they do n't stand out in the sand . Their shells house a tasty portion of innards , so this species is a favorite of those who enjoy crab .
$ENTITY Nothing 's changed since I was a kid . $ENTITY We all still get silly when it snows ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY W-wait , ... Would you please stop staring at my house while I 'm standing right here ? $ENTITY It 's making me feel all embarrassed for some reason , ... .

$ENTITY , the snow really makes $ENTITY sparkle , $ENTITY do n't you think ? $ENTITY I could just sit here and stare at it all day long ...

Butterfly fish are considered very cute pets , popular because of their beautiful nature . They glide through the warm seas by flapping their yellow bodies as if they were butterflies . Their diets are surprisingly hardy , as they gobble coral and poisonous anemones using narrow mouths . Butterfly-fish couples have been known to live together for 10 years or more . Often they can be seen swimming around in pairs . You 'll likely never find a better underwater romance .

Barred knifejaws stand out thanks to the seven stripes adorning their white bodies . Their natural curiosity and strong pull make them a popular target of anglers , but they 're no easy catch . They have strong teeth that allow them to make short work of sea creatures with tough shells . This means that both urchins and mollusks need to be careful , lest they become meals for these fish .
$ENTITY You wo n't help me ? Well , I guess I 'm in this alone ... . Never mind then , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY By opening up your strike zone by one inch , $ENTITY you open yourself up to many new opportunities for love . $ENTITY

$ENTITY , huh ? ... Any hamsters in there ? $ENTITY Hamsters like to run a lot , right ? $ENTITY Makes me wonder if maybe I 'm part hamster ... .

$ENTITY At this time of year , $ENTITY all I can think about is $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I want to go join in all the fun , $ENTITY but I do n't know what to wear . $ENTITY I never thought I 'd say this , $ENTITY but I have too many clothes . $ENTITY Wait $ENTITY I take it back !

$ENTITY # x0 ;
$ENTITY Even if she had exactly the same stuff as someone else , $ENTITY she 'd make her stuff sparkle more !
$ENTITY Since $ENTITY is so talented at making sweets , I bet she 's particular about the tea she drinks . $ENTITY That 's why she has such a nice $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Yo , ... What brings you all the way out to little $ENTITY ? $ENTITY ?
This island is a resort where people from all over the world can enjoy a paradise of everlasting summer .

... Just let me know when you decide what you want to drink .
$ENTITY Since $ENTITY has ... maybe I can get her to make me something . She might get offended if I ask her , though .
$ENTITY Hey , what an adorable outfit that is , $ENTITY ! I should totally get you a ball of string to play with .
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY that must be why you looked so absentminded , ... Well then , $ENTITY let 's hang out later when you have time to spare , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 've got good news ... Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer has arrived in ... And some bad news : $ENTITY he only had one sack of gifts . $ENTITY How could he fit everything I want in there ?
$ENTITY Yeah ! We 're totally on the same page , right ? That 's what I thought ! $ENTITY Well , since I 've got your blessing ... it 's decided ! $ENTITY I 'm gon na move here ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey , hey , ... You 're walkin ' way too fast ! ... Why would you just leave me behind like that ?
$ENTITY So $ENTITY do you have a museum in your hometown ? $ENTITY How does it stack up to ours ? $ENTITY It 's taken a little time , $ENTITY but we 've built a fairly impressive collection , $ENTITY if I do n't say so myself .
$ENTITY Wow , we get to celebrate both the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY and $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY on the same day ? $ENTITY How exciting !
$ENTITY Now , I bet you think I adore all things sweet , but that 's not exactly true ... When it comes to $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY pies , I hate all that syrupy , gooey sweetness . $ENTITY But here 's the perfect solution : $ENTITY honey ! Just a dab of honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY evens out the flavor . $ENTITY That way , you get a dessert that 's perfectly sweet and adorable $ENTITY just like little ol ' me !
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY You have an extremely nice bookshelf just sitting in here ! $ENTITY It 's just you 're always running around outside , so I 'd never peg you as the reading type ... But that 's a good thing , of course ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey ! I got over that awful cold I had . Wow , I was SO sick of sneezing all the time ! $ENTITY I 'm so happy about that $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY you got for me ! $ENTITY Here . Take ... as thanks !

$ENTITY I ca n't believe it 's your birthday $ENTITY AND $ENTITY it 's my birthday too ! $ENTITY This is , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY the best day of the year ! $ENTITY Two birthdays , $ENTITY two cakes , $ENTITY and double the presents !
$ENTITY might seem like an outstanding mayor , but I 'm the one really pulling the strings ! $ENTITY If you 're ever in trouble , $ENTITY come and see me ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY
then , why do n't you start by telling me $ENTITY what kind of dream you want to have ? $ENTITY I 'll leave it up to you ! Input Dream Address . I 'll search for one ! Actually , I 'll pass ...
$ENTITY Just as I expected , ... The classic sushi choice ...
$ENTITY Achoo ! ... I ca n't stop sneezing ! $ENTITY I wish I could hang out today , $ENTITY but I 'm just not feeling up to it . $ENTITY I got some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY from ... Hopefully I 'll be back on my feet soon ... . Just not today .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY YAY ! Can I open it now ? !
ENTITY Oh my ... I see your wallet is full , as well as your pockets . $ENTITY I 'd like to give you a thank-you gift , $ENTITY but I ca n't give it to you like this . $ENTITY Mmmmm ... Do you think you could reorganize your belongings for me ?
What ? You did n't deliver the package to $ENTITY yet ? $ENTITY Well , I suppose I really should have delivered it myself to begin with . $ENTITY Here $ENTITY I 'll do it , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY Is n't $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY , like , totally magical ? I 'm feeling so much better now ! I have n't even sneezed once ! $ENTITY But I 'm still sick , so I 'm gon na have to take it easy for a little while longer , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 'll make this short . There are two ways to make a lot of Bells around here , $ENTITY . First , by catching insects and fish . $ENTITY So buy a $ENTITY fishing rod $ENTITY and a $ENTITY net $ENTITY . You can sell what you catch . Second , by digging wherever you see those marks . $ENTITY Buy a $ENTITY shovel $ENTITY and then get to work . You can sell your finds at $ENTITY Re-Tail $ENTITY , but you can also donate them to $ENTITY Blathers $ENTITY . He wants bugs , fish , and other special things for his museum . $ENTITY That owl 's got a good heart . But he wo n't pay you a single Bell ... . Are you the charitable type ? $ENTITY We 're getting ahead of ourselves . Buy yourself a net , a fishing rod , and a shovel . $ENTITY J
$ENTITY Oh ! You do n't know ? ! That board is crucial around here . It 's a major source of news , you know ! $ENTITY I plan to wander over there later to get all the latest on what 's happening . And who 's coming . Did you know that when $ENTITY birds $ENTITY perch on it , there 's new information ? $ENTITY It 's true . They must be real busybodies , do n't you think ? $ENTITY Well , ta-ta ... . Things to do , $ENTITY people to see !
... Ah ! If you 're finding it difficult to get your hands on a fishing rod , ... come back and let me know . For now , $ENTITY good luck !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I know what you mean ! ... I filled my bathtub with $ENTITY once . $ENTITY Then I pretended I was a whale .
$ENTITY I used to have a job in a bakery ... but I just was n't making enough dough . $ENTITY
Redd 's Cookie Congrats ! You got a bang prize !
$ENTITY Like , whoa ! $ENTITY Is that my old ... That totally takes me back ! $ENTITY I 'm not sure what 's more shocking $ENTITY the fact that you still have it or the fact that you 're giving it back ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY But since you went to the trouble of bringing it to me , ... I 'll let you have it for free !
... I understand . It 's disappointing , though ... ACHOO !
$ENTITY By the way , you can find equipment during the day at $ENTITY T.I.Y . $ENTITY over on Main Street , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh ... it 's already getting that late ? ... Heh heh heh . $ENTITY You stayed out all night too , did n't you ?
... Oh $ENTITY , ummm . $ENTITY Eh heh heh .
$ENTITY Gim me a coffee ! ... And make it a $ENTITY Kilimanjaro $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY you 'll really do it ? ! ... That 's gon na help me a bunch ! $ENTITY All right then ! $ENTITY Go find people from other towns who $ENTITY look like rabbits $ENTITY and collect $ENTITY signatures ... Male or female , it does n't matter ! $ENTITY Here 's the signature form !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Ah , ... you ready to head out all of a sudden ? $ENTITY I know I dragged you over here , so thanks for being such a good sport !
$ENTITY , $ENTITY that 's actually a pretty scary look on you . $ENTITY If this were n't $ENTITY Bean Day $ENTITY , $ENTITY I 'd be terrified !
ENTITY Findin ' them resettin ' cheaters and readin ' 'em the riot act is what the Reset Center $ENTITY pays me for . $ENTITY Get it ? $ENTITY Maybe you 've heard the old wives ' tale about moles never gettin ' angry for anything ? $ENTITY Yeah ? $ENTITY Well them wives were off their rockers , 'cause this mole ai n't takin ' no guff from punk kids ! $ENTITY Next time you see me , I 'll be wearin ' my ANGRY hat ... . You 've been warned !
... You 're totally eyeing my ... Do n't deny it ! $ENTITY FINE . $ENTITY I ca n't deal with this pressure . I give in . $ENTITY I 'll let you have it for $ENTITY Bells ... Um , thanks ? I do n't even want it !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY They already bought a replacement for it ? $ENTITY Haha ! $ENTITY That 's classic !
$ENTITY Ah ! $ENTITY That 's you , right , ... ... . It 's me , ... When I came here on a camping trip , ... practically ordered me to move to ... I 'm glad I moved here ... But as soon as I did , $ENTITY I caught a small cold ... . Cough cough ... ... When I get better , $ENTITY let 's catch up , all right ... ? $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY thanks for delivering that package for me ! $ENTITY I do n't suppose $ENTITY said anything ? $ENTITY Well ... I do n't remember .
$ENTITY For meeting your goal , you 've earned $ENTITY # xE ; * ... # x0 ; ls m $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh no ! $ENTITY It would have been nice to hear what $ENTITY but that 's OK. $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ever seen an elephant sneeze ? Maaan , EVERYONE gets caught in the crosshairs there . $ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's getting colder and colder ! ... Which means that later tonight , it could be FREEZING cold , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Thanks for getting $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Santa ! $ENTITY Um ... are you looking for your big bag of awesome presents to give to good kids like me ? $ENTITY Why do n't you ask $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer ? $ENTITY It seems like you always have him hold it for you .
If you make $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY without $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , $ENTITY you 're doing it wrong . $ENTITY Of course some people say anything goes in a $ENTITY bouillabaisse $ENTITY , $ENTITY but I just do n't buy it . $ENTITY You need fresh fish , $ENTITY you need savory broth , $ENTITY and you definitely need that lemon juice !
$ENTITY If you 're going for the same bug as someone else and they get it ... it 's bound to steam your broccoli ! $ENTITY But this is the $ENTITY Bug-Off ... You ca n't waste time brawling with your rivals ! $ENTITY There are bugs to catch ! $ENTITY You have to just let stuff go and move on , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's so nice to meet you ! $ENTITY I 'm ... I moved here from $ENTITY , actually . $ENTITY I 'd hoped to make the rounds and say hello sooner , $ENTITY but it took so long to settle in , ... ! $ENTITY The hard part was unpacking , $ENTITY so at least I 'm finally finished with that . $ENTITY I plan on seeing everything there is to see here in ... Let 's spend some time together soon !
$ENTITY Tonight in ... we 'll be able to see an amazing autumn moon . $ENTITY The full moon shines so brightly at this time of year . $ENTITY You do n't want to miss it ! Of course , $ENTITY you can see it in your town too ... .but it 'd be pretty cool to say you saw it in both places !
$ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY to you ! $ENTITY Um , $ENTITY Santa ... By any chance , $ENTITY did you bring what I wished for ?
$ENTITY So $ENTITY how did I look up there on the podium today ? $ENTITY What ? $ENTITY You did n't even go to the awards ceremony ? ... you missed my shining moment ! $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY I guess I 'll just have to dominate the next $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY too . $ENTITY Ha !
$ENTITY I 'm just glad someone will get some use out of this old thing ... . !
$ENTITY This is where I come at the end of the week to unwind . $ENTITY It 's so peaceful , $ENTITY staring up into the sky .
$ENTITY Do you like the sky ? ... If you press up on , $ENTITY you can look up and see the sky ! $ENTITY A bank of clouds in clear summer skies ... The northern lights in the winter sky ... And shooting stars shining in the night sky ... . $ENTITY Stop and look at the sky sometimes ! $ENTITY Once , I thought I saw a guy flying around up there , fighting crime ! $ENTITY Turned out it was just $ENTITY Pete $ENTITY . Heh .
ENTITY Oh ... I get this $ENTITY sense about that style . $ENTITY It 's a nice look for you , by the way . $ENTITY Just so you know , the price is only $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY for that item ... . What would you like to do ? $ENTITY I 'll take it ! I 'll keep it on ! Never mind .
$ENTITY What do I usually listen to ? ... I 'd listen to anything , really , $ENTITY as long as no one else is listening to it yet ! Oh , and a lot of 8-bit chiptunes of course , $ENTITY because those are glorious ... .
... I think I get it . $ENTITY has this $ENTITY on display to be ironic . $ENTITY Bravo , ... It 's trs avant-garde !
$ENTITY Oh no ! ... 's birthday $ENTITY is tomorrow , is n't it ? ! $ENTITY I reminded myself a while back , but $ENTITY I completely forgot ! ... Great . Now I got ta go find a present ... .
$ENTITY Remember that fruit I asked for ? $ENTITY I was able to order it online . $ENTITY Do n't worry about it now , but thanks !
Speaking of coffee , back in the day , I often thought to myself , $ENTITY `` I want to tell a joke so funny , it makes the audience spit out their coffee ! '' ... You know ? I was never able to do that . $ENTITY There were times they got mad and chased after me , though ... .
$ENTITY Thanks for taking the time to show me your place ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Heh heh . Ye got a real style o ' yer own , do n't ye ! $ENTITY
It 's getting dark out . $ENTITY I guess that means $ENTITY Festivale $ENTITY is almost over for this year , ... .

Hey there , sprout ! $ENTITY Gim me a cup of coffee to go !
$ENTITY What do you mean you opened it ? ! $ENTITY How can you just open someone else 's property like that ?
$ENTITY # x0 ;

$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY I did n't think you 'd actually change your mind ... . I 've talked myself out of a deal !

I guess you 're busy too . $ENTITY Well , I 'll just take care of it later .
$ENTITY The $ENTITY petition needs signatures ! $ENTITY Get on it !
$ENTITY The worst restaurant in the world can still brag about that fact , but , maaaan , second worst is just bad . $ENTITY
$ENTITY My best ... Oh man , $ENTITY I was worried sick about losing this . $ENTITY I looked everywhere . $ENTITY Next time I lose my old gym socks , $ENTITY I know where to go for help !

$ENTITY Hmmm ... Yeah , I get that . One day you 're just suddenly able to drink it , and you kind of crave it . $ENTITY I remember when I really wanted to be able to drink it and I just forced myself to get it down ... . I think the first coffee that tasted good to me was at $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY 's . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Thanks , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY I totally thought we were talking about layer cake ...
$ENTITY Hey , ... You asked me to come all the way here . $ENTITY We gon na have a duel or what ?
$ENTITY What do you think of my ... Is n't it fascinating ? $ENTITY Every time I look at it , $ENTITY it raises new questions in my mind !
$ENTITY That rhythm was out of this world ! ... I hope mine was just as good !
$ENTITY Do you think any bugs can lift a hundred times their own weight , like me ? $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY This place is just small enough to make shopping nice and easy , $ENTITY right ? !
$ENTITY Do n't poke your nose in where it does n't belong ! $ENTITY You might learn something you did n't want to . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! ... Take a look at this , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY What can I do for you , ... ?

$ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY But you 'd look even BETTER if you 'd only snazz up your image a little bit ! $ENTITY Like , $ENTITY with an attitude !
$ENTITY Oh , yeah ! $ENTITY Have you heard about this $ENTITY Gulliver $ENTITY character ? $ENTITY He 's been on the beach since this morning !

$ENTITY I shook a tree the other day , and $ENTITY money fell out $ENTITY of the branches ! $ENTITY I was all like , whoa ! $ENTITY I do n't know who put it in there , ... but I figure it 's karmic payback for all the good things I do . $ENTITY Totally kidding ! $ENTITY But seriously , you should shake a tree next time you can . $ENTITY Who knows what 'll happen ?
$ENTITY Oh wow ! Santa ? ! ... That 's so cool ! ... But ... would n't it be smarter to show up at night like $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY usually does ?

$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY Nice outfit , ... Way to celebrate the day ! $ENTITY But , um ... .have you seen $ENTITY Jingle ... He 's usually passing out presents by now .

$ENTITY Thank you ! $ENTITY Thank $ENTITY you ! ... Dr. Shrunk is in the house ! $ENTITY My $ENTITY Joy Joke $ENTITY is just the thing to CURE what ails you ! $ENTITY I 'm simply bursting with joy up here on the stage today ! $ENTITY Wan na know why ? ... A visitor just complimented me ! $ENTITY He told me that when he has trouble sleeping ... he comes to see my show ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Congratulations ! You hit 100,000 points ! $ENTITY
I wonder if I 'd catch more fish if I put a bit of $ENTITY on the end of my line . $ENTITY Who knows ?
$ENTITY Ooh ! ... was just about to show me some dance moves !
$ENTITY Festivale $ENTITY lasts all day ... So I 'm going to eat a good breakfast and store up some energy , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You know , ... likes to dress pretty conservatively ... But I bet if we opened up this $ENTITY , we 'd find all kinds of outrageous clothes !
Did you $ENTITY come to the shop today to sell something ? Is that your plan ?
Is n't your face a bit too close , ... ? Scooch back !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY is so mature . $ENTITY He 's got $ENTITY right here in his house !
$ENTITY You 're a big help ! Thanks ! $ENTITY Here . $ENTITY As the town 's number-one master of catchin ' stuff ... you totally deserve this !
$ENTITY What 's all this I hear $ENTITY about you wanting to see me , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY What 's the matter , ... Hide-and-seek ? ! $ENTITY That 's old news ! $ENTITY It did n't seem like you were into the whole seeking thing , $ENTITY so the match just sort of ended ... Next time , bring your A-game !
love your enthusiasm , Mayor , but why do n't we prioritize getting your house built first ? I 'm sure you 're ready to move out of that tent , and it needs to be done before you can get your permit .
$ENTITY He 's just silent on the INSIDE , silly . Like , he 's all deep and stuff . $ENTITY But he likes to TALK about being deep . $ENTITY And anyway , you practically begged me to cast you in my play ! Now , you had better get serious about this . $ENTITY OK , let 's start again from the top !
$ENTITY Heya , ... We 're having a birthday party for $ENTITY today ! $ENTITY Let 's get this place pumped up ! $ENTITY
'm the fake one ! ... Darn it . What gave me away ?
ENTITY Oh , I 'm just kidding ! Come on now , Sis ... Chill out and loosen up a bit !

Today 's $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY meant it was dark all day . $ENTITY It was fun , even if I did walk into stuff , ... .
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY it looks like $ENTITY made some tea for us , ... I always thought she was a tomboy , $ENTITY but surprisingly $ENTITY she seems to have a refined side too !
Oh , and one more thing ... $ENTITY It 's against the rules to be bringin ' stuff on the tour , so put yer stuff in the $ENTITY Box $ENTITY before ye sit down . $ENTITY If yer still holdin ' any items when we depart , we 'll just pay ye cash for 'em , yar ? Might seem a bit weird , but it be a customary practice here in the islands , yar har har !
ENTITY You 're raring to go $ENTITY , are n't ya ! $ENTITY The tourney starts at $ENTITY 9 a.m. $ENTITY Good luck , and catch a bunch of fish ! $ENTITY Nyuk $ENTITY nyuk $ENTITY nyuk ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY PAPER !
$ENTITY Yeah , thanks again for saving my taste buds , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Huh ... # x0 ; $ENTITY I do n't know what to say ... Hmm . You practiced a lot , huh ? ... Still , $ENTITY striking a pose twice might be a little too much , ... .
I wonder what the fish $ENTITY think when they see me ... $ENTITY They 're probably like , $ENTITY `` That 's so weird how he walks around on legs $ENTITY instead of swimming ! ''
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY You 've gone the extra mile and then some on your trips out of town ! ... Making so many trips is no simple achievement . This old man is amazed at your love of travel !
$ENTITY Just sit back and chow down , I guess ?
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY good to see you $ENTITY ! Welcome to our winter wonderland . Sure it 's cold , $ENTITY but we 're worth it .
$ENTITY When you have the space and $ENTITY 500 Bells $ENTITY , come see me and I 'll sell you one !
$ENTITY What ? ! ... Oh , I get it ... You 're one of those indecisive types ! $ENTITY Maybe I should tell you about the first time I laid eyes on my precious ...
$ENTITY It 's our own snowy wonderland !
$ENTITY Well then , $ENTITY Mayor , I 'll see you soon !
$ENTITY I just talked to ... and ... # x0 ; said ... # x0 ; saw someone arriving at the station . $ENTITY It must be that new person moving to ... Should we go try to meet the new arrival , $ENTITY or give them a little space ? $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I think I 'm too excited to wait !
Guess what ? ... Bunny Day $ENTITY is tomorrow ! $ENTITY It 's a highly symbolic holiday with lots of tradition and ritual . $ENTITY But I 'm just in it for the chocolates . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! Right on ! $ENTITY Bit of an airhead , that one , but not a bad kid overall . Just play nice , OK ?
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems you 've had an incredible number of dreams up until now . Truly remarkable ! ... But I do n't want you to just dream . I want you to share your wonderful dreams with other people too !
$ENTITY Aw man , thanks for bringing this back to me ! $ENTITY It might not be much , $ENTITY but here . Take my $ENTITY with you ! ... !
$ENTITY So that must mean $ENTITY you came here today to catch some bugs ! ... I hope you snag a rare one , ... !
HELLO , ... If you do n't answer the door soon , $ENTITY people will think I 'm a loan shark or something ! $ENTITY
Oh , $ENTITY look $ENTITY at $ENTITY you . Up and at it early on such a DARK morning ? ! $ENTITY OK , bravo to you , $ENTITY . $ENTITY I can barely make my brain work on the $ENTITY Winter Solstice $ENTITY ! And here you are looking all sunny .
$ENTITY Please make yourself right at home , ... !
$ENTITY Hello there , $ENTITY . I have n't decided what to choose yet today , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Haha ! She really does get me ! ... Awesome !
Thanks , $ENTITY . I think I will stick with this style .
$ENTITY My key chain ... The `` N '' stands for ... `` nothing 's better '' ! $ENTITY And if you combine them together , ... we 'd be `` sweet nothings '' ! $ENTITY # xE ;
$ENTITY Was $ENTITY 's house always so spacious ? ... It seems ... grander ... than I remember . $ENTITY Good for ... # x0 ; $ENTITY . $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; really going for it . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY It 's ... Stopped by for a visit , huh , ... ?
$ENTITY No music ? Aye , $ENTITY whatever floats yer boat , I suppose .
Fresh brewed ... and piping hot ... Here you are . $ENTITY Thanks ! I 'll just let it cool .
Um , so I noticed your shovel . $ENTITY You are n't about to go bury a pitfall seed , are you ? $ENTITY I hope not ! $ENTITY I always fall in those stupid things , ... .
there another way $ENTITY I could help you $ENTITY find a dream ? $ENTITY I 'll leave it up to you ! Input Dream Address . I 'll search for one ! Uh , I 'll pass for now ...
The $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY I got from $ENTITY should be kicking in , ... Hey ! $ENTITY Body ! $ENTITY You can do it ! $ENTITY Do n't let this cold beat you !
$ENTITY Whew ... I 'm just burning up . $ENTITY This cold is really doing a number on me . $ENTITY But I got some $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY from ... so I 'll just take it easy today . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Yup ! Thanks ! I 'll do my best to find a place to live , ...
$ENTITY It 's so quiet and dim in here ... . It 's the perfect place to eavesdrop , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY When Mr. Sun does n't come out , it sure gets $ENTITY cold ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! So he was impressed that I actually returned it ? $ENTITY Hmmm ... It feels weird getting praise from him . That 's not really his style .
$ENTITY This huge sound ... It stirs up my animal blood ! ... !
Yeah ... Does n't this person have a favorite phrase ? $ENTITY Seems like that info could help somehow ...
It 's ... Really , it 's not much . Just a small thanks for the delivery .
... this collection is really starting to come together . $ENTITY If we keep adding new pieces , $ENTITY this will be a real art destination before long !
$ENTITY Arghh ! $ENTITY A correct answer does n't mean anything unless you figure it out yourself ! ...
$ENTITY The HH Showcase is open all year round , 24 hours a day . $ENTITY It 's only during times where visitors are few and far between that we get a chance for short breaks . $ENTITY Sadly , since I ca n't predict when someone will come by , I ca n't stay here relaxing forever .
$ENTITY WAAAAAH ! $ENTITY It 's an ogre !
$ENTITY Slow down there ! $ENTITY That seems like an AWFUL lot of work ...
$ENTITY I know , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY I want to do one on $ENTITY how to dress for the season .
$ENTITY I wonder if fossils ever ate $ENTITY while they were alive .
$ENTITY This is the ... told me about . $ENTITY She said it was , like , $ENTITY super-duper comfy . $ENTITY Remind me to sit down on it later ! ... I bet she and I have very different definitions of the word $ENTITY `` comfort . ''
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems like you 've become very informed on what goes on under the surface of the ocean ... . It makes this old man happy seeing you filling in the blanks in your sea- creatures-collection encyclopedia !
What ? ! This is serious !
ENTITY Yeah , you 've been working hard ! $ENTITY Please do your best to get the job done before dawn comes around !
$ENTITY Guess what ! ... Blathers $ENTITY is building a robot that looks just like him ! $ENTITY I guess he got tired of standing in the museum 24 hours a day ! $ENTITY Way cool ! You lie !
$ENTITY Yeah , it was beyond cool ! The party was down at the beach ! $ENTITY Everyone was sipping the most delicious $ENTITY out of seashells ! $ENTITY And I ate some $ENTITY off of a surfboard ! $ENTITY Can $ENTITY you $ENTITY believe $ENTITY it , ... ? $ENTITY Wait ... . That 's totally weird , is n't it ? ! ... I 'm surprised I did n't get splinters in my mouth , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Are n't I styling ? ! $ENTITY Just look at my outfit today ! ... Classy all the way ! $ENTITY There are some folks who think this look is outdated , but ... They 'll never understand just how great $ENTITY clothing can really be ! $ENTITY GAHAHA !
Zzz $ENTITY snooooore ... Yaaaawn . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ha ! $ENTITY I totally knew I 'd run into you here , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I must be , $ENTITY like , $ENTITY a psychic or something !
ENTITY Whaaaat ? $ENTITY I thought you really had something ! ... Man , $ENTITY what are you doing to me ? Are n't we fishing buddies ?
$ENTITY I like to come and visit these bugs $ENTITY because I feel like they 'd do the same for me if I were in a museum .
$ENTITY Would n't it be great if the sky rained $ENTITY instead of water , ... ?
This town is already plenty tidy , but there are so many other towns out there overrun with weeds . $ENTITY If you hear your friend 's town has turned into a real jungle , I hope you 'll go give that friend a hand !
$ENTITY For helping out , I wan na give you something happy . Come back when you 've got room in your pockets ! ... Oh , and I 'm kind of forgetful , $ENTITY so do n't leave town or anything ! $ENTITY Come right back before my memory slips !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY It was like being on an overnight school field trip ... We even had a knock-down , drag-out pillow fight ! $ENTITY I do n't think I 've ever been in an organized pillow-fight tournament before . $ENTITY I did n't know they existed ! $ENTITY But it was more fun than I thought ! ... You really should try it sometime ! $ENTITY Start training now ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY that 's my cue to skedaddle , $ENTITY cats and kittens . $ENTITY Adios , ... Hasta la vista , ... Ciao , $ENTITY !
If you cut down a tree with an axe , $ENTITY it leaves a stump , right ? $ENTITY I heard that sometimes $ENTITY there are stumps with strange patterns on 'em , ... And sometimes next to those strange stumps $ENTITY you can find rare mushrooms growing . $ENTITY Rare mushrooms ... I bet they taste amazing , ... !
$ENTITY Oh ! Soccer , huh ? That 's a fun sport to play ! $ENTITY I 'd love to show you how amazing my trapping skills are ! $ENTITY But I 've got some injuries right now , and I 'm not allowed to do much tricky stuff ... Maybe next time !
$ENTITY I just ca n't wait to get this back home , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY OK , we 're on ! Come over to my place at ... !
$ENTITY Where are you going ? ... My house is n't that way .
$ENTITY is , like , totally obsessed with ... Why else would he have it in his room ?
ENTITY One of the shops on Main Street has been remodeled ! It 's now a fancy new $ENTITY supermarket $ENTITY ! It 's bigger now , and there are even more items to buy . $ENTITY I ca n't wait to go shopping there ! $ENTITY You should , too !
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY It 's really OK ? ! ... Oh , wow . $ENTITY You just made my day ! $ENTITY Here you go $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY You 're not gon na find nothin ' , $ENTITY so quit snoopin ' around !
$ENTITY Hmm ... I wonder if $ENTITY likes me . $ENTITY When I go jogging , she yells stuff like , `` You can do it ! '' $ENTITY It 's kinda weird because she used to be so cold to me ! $ENTITY She 's full of surprises . $ENTITY The other day when I was out running , she actually sprinted past me !
$ENTITY Oh , wow ... You have time for TV ? $ENTITY I always see you outside , $ENTITY so when do you get the time to watch ?
$ENTITY Comfy underwear is important to us men . $ENTITY looks comfy . $ENTITY does n't . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Did you have fun at the tournament today ? $ENTITY Having a good time is the most important thing , $ENTITY !
You did it ! Good job ! $ENTITY But do n't drop that net yet ! I 'll toss in some bonus medals if you catch more .
$ENTITY You know , all this snow looks so pure , $ENTITY . It 's a shame we walk all over it , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! It 's you , ... What are you doing out here in the rain at night ? ... !
$ENTITY Well , if you 're interested , would you like to buy it for ... $ENTITY Bells ... Yes ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY why 'd you start practicing all of a sudden anyway ? $ENTITY Just get one of your boyfriends to do the smooshing . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I 'm counting on you to bring me a $ENTITY butterfly ... . Any kind is fine !
$ENTITY Great ! Thanks a bunch !
I caught a cyclommatus stag ! Need some tweezers ? ... mm $ENTITY
$ENTITY A dash of $ENTITY flashy $ENTITY and a splash of $ENTITY rock ' n ' roll ... I see stormy weather ahead with this stylish look !
I 'd like to curate my own exhibit one day ... . Of course , $ENTITY my show would feature old books instead of bones .
Hey , listen . $ENTITY I recommend frying giant snakehead $ENTITY in peanut oil . Delish ! You ca n't beat that idea ! ... OK , well , me , $ENTITY I 'm just gon na scarf it down raw , of course ! You still get the picture , though ... . YUM !
$ENTITY A mussel-eating competition ! $ENTITY We 're gon na find out who 's got the strongest stomach ! ... So I 'm training my mussel muscles !
$ENTITY Oh $ENTITY yeah ! $ENTITY We were just saying you smell like ... You probably eat that all the time .
$ENTITY A- $ENTITY are you ... the real ... Whoa ! I 'm so glad you 're back ! Everyone was really worried ! $ENTITY Without you , $ENTITY is n't the same lively town ! $ENTITY We 're looking forward to a legendary comeback , ... !
$ENTITY That 's why I 've prepared a special little something to really celebrate $ENTITY Groundhog Day $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Look who 's here $ENTITY ! I just knew you 'd be dropping in , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY One time I tasted a $ENTITY cherry pie $ENTITY that was made with too little sugar ... . My taste buds are still recovering ! $ENTITY So that 's why I always add a little honey from a $ENTITY beehive $ENTITY to my pies . $ENTITY It 's a natural sweetener that complements the tartness of the fruit ... . You 're welcome !
ENTITY Suddenly you were gone ! $ENTITY The surprise . It was great ... . A problem , maybe ? $ENTITY Nope . No problem . Yes , I need to leave .
$ENTITY It 's going to be so hard to wait until tonight ! $ENTITY I just ca n't wait !
$ENTITY I ca n't let you go without a token of my appreciation . $ENTITY Please , $ENTITY take my $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh , great . $ENTITY Then let 's get going , ... .
$ENTITY The $ENTITY seems like a very comfortable place to sleep . I bet $ENTITY is always so feisty because she gets lots of rest .
$ENTITY Thanks a big bunch , $ENTITY !
The crying of brown cicadas is usually associated with the sound of hot oil sputtering . Their wings are brown instead of being transparent , making them a rare species throughout the world . While completely harmless by themselves , in swarms they can cause devastation to crops .
Hey now ! $ENTITY No time for talkin ' ! $ENTITY Get outta here !
$ENTITY It 's not as good as a department store , but this place does have a good product lineup ! $ENTITY Since you 're here , you should buy a ton of stuff ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY The correct answer is ... the peach ! $ENTITY Nice ! $ENTITY It would 've been super sad if you had n't won a single round .
$ENTITY My guests usually tell me my furniture suits me , but ... do you think they 're just flattering me ?
$ENTITY Ha ! $ENTITY I know I 'm cool , but you do n't have to stalk me everywhere , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY You 've got a very stylish way of walking , you know that ?
$ENTITY That actually sounds like a lot of fun ! $ENTITY I have no idea if I 'd have the stamina , $ENTITY but I 'd give it a try !
All right ! $ENTITY So what sorts of friends are waiting to meet me here in the clear , blue water ... ?
Well , $ENTITY I guess I really should do it myself anyway , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Ogre , $ENTITY ogre , $ENTITY go away . $ENTITY Come again another day . $ENTITY Or , $ENTITY do n't .
$ENTITY Yeah , yeah ... You totally hit the nail right on the head , dude . $ENTITY This place is just average ... for now ! ... I 'll work harder on sprucing it up !
$ENTITY But I 'm sure I just need time to get used to it .
Oh , ... would n't go with you ? ... Well , no worries . $ENTITY I 'll just go see ... # x0 ; $ENTITY myself later , ... .
I should have brought my skis ! $ENTITY Winter sports are fun , mostly because you can never do them in the summer , ... !
$ENTITY It 's no surprise $ENTITY has ... I remember him saying something about not being able to wake up unless he takes a shower !
This snow 's never going to let up , is it ? $ENTITY Well , our town looks good covered in snow , $ENTITY so that 's OK .
$ENTITY That 's right ! ... I 've been carrying my coins in this glove I do n't wear anymore . But the clerks at the store always look at me funny , $ENTITY so maybe I should get an actual change purse .
$ENTITY Me $ENTITY wife 's $ENTITY the $ENTITY best $ENTITY cook $ENTITY that $ENTITY you 'll ... ver $ENTITY know . $ENTITY When $ENTITY she $ENTITY makes $ENTITY stew , $ENTITY it 's $ENTITY real $ENTITY ly $ENTITY quite $ENTITY a $ENTITY show ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I see . $ENTITY You find a certain charm and elegance in the way I speak ? $ENTITY Ha ha ! $ENTITY Thank you . $ENTITY I am honored . $ENTITY However , $ENTITY my speech has style and sophistication . $ENTITY It has no place with sweat and muscle and athleticism ... Unfortunately $ENTITY , I do n't believe big words will do you much good ... yo .
$ENTITY
... I 'm wondering if you could help me out ? You see , $ENTITY I splurged on something recently . $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY it 's nothing really . Just ... The problem is , $ENTITY I already have one . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY This guy is copying my face !
... =
$ENTITY Oh man , you do n't mean ... Are you going around gathering up treats as well ? $ENTITY Then let 's make a deal ! ... We 'll battle for treats over a game ! $ENTITY If you win , $ENTITY I 'll share some of my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY with you ! $ENTITY But if you lose , ... I 'm gon na play a prank on you ! ... So how about it ? $ENTITY Sounds fitting for $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , right ?
Once we hit the $ENTITY Summer Solstice ... that 's when I can really slip into the summer mind-set ! $ENTITY Make sure the heat does n't wear you out , though , ... !
ENTITY Our museum is filling up , I 'll have you know . $ENTITY Yes , we 've been feathering this nest quite nicely . So if you 're in the mood for this or that , you 'll be sure to find it . $ENTITY Visitors always leave quite satisfied .
$ENTITY I 'm looking for a small piece of furniture . Something that wo n't take up much space in my room .
$ENTITY I was just thinking about how hungry I was getting ! ... Thanks !

$ENTITY You better not be teasing me ! $ENTITY Heh ... . I mean ... another triumph for me and my wardrobe ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hah ! $ENTITY I get it . $ENTITY You 're playing it cool . $ENTITY Trying your best not to cry . $ENTITY It 's OK. $ENTITY Do NOT start blubbering ! $ENTITY It 's not like we can never visit each other ! $ENTITY Well , I got ta go plan my big move . $ENTITY See ya around , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hi , ... Welcome back ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY These clothes are pretty awesome , huh ? $ENTITY I really like clothes that have $ENTITY look !
There 's a silly belief in the fashion world that high price always means high quality . No way , honey ! But there 's something to be said for spending a few more Bells on an item you know is going to last .
$ENTITY Way over there , huh ? $ENTITY Pretty sweet !
$ENTITY I feel rejuvenated by that juicy treat , ... That was a great $ENTITY . $ENTITY Now I need to repay your kindness . Here . Take this with you . $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY .
The triceratops was a very large herbivore , commonly identified by its three horns and large bone frill . Its horns were likely used for turf wars and for fighting over females rather than for protection . While it 's true that it most likely lived in the same era as the T. rex , the two probably did n't fight much .
$ENTITY Aw ... It does n't look like there 's any free samples , ... .
$ENTITY No , I do n't want something to hang on the wall $ENTITY I want something to replace my $ENTITY . I need something for the floor !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY So , $ENTITY , $ENTITY I think we need a new way of saying hello . Not my usual `` $ENTITY hello there $ENTITY . '' $ENTITY And I think I 've come to trust you enough to choose one . How about it ? $ENTITY Sure ! No , thanks .
$ENTITY Hey hey ! $ENTITY Made it ! ...
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY No ! $ENTITY That 's not it at all ! $ENTITY I was just nervous ! $ENTITY I 'm sorry ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh , do n't get all sensitive ! I just mean I can give you tips on $ENTITY how to , $ENTITY you know , $ENTITY be more girly !
$ENTITY If it ai n't ... Long time no see ... Like , $ENTITY $ w $ENTITY # x0 ; k ... # x0 ; k w $ENTITY # x0 ; ks ? $ENTITY You 've got a big presence , $ENTITY so even a few days without you feels like a super-long time ! ... But anyway , I 'm glad you 're doin ' all right ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
... I see ye be carryin ' some things there . $ENTITY It 's against the rules to be bringin ' stuff on the tour , so put yer stuff in the $ENTITY Box $ENTITY before ye sit , yar . $ENTITY If yer still holdin ' any items when we depart , we 'll just pay ye cash for 'em , yar ? Might seem a bit weird , but it be a customary practice here in the islands , yar har har !
Hey , I do n't like getting all serious and stuff , $ENTITY but you always remember to save your game , do n't you ? It 's so sad what happens when you do n't save . $ENTITY It 's like everything that happened last time ... . did n't ! $ENTITY Do you know how to save ? $ENTITY Press $ENTITY START $ENTITY , and then select $ENTITY Save and quit $ENTITY . If you 'd rather keep playing , select $ENTITY Save and continue $ENTITY . $ENTITY See ? Easy !
$ENTITY There 's no point in rushing like that , $ENTITY so let 's take our time ! Savor the journey , not the destination !
$ENTITY Ooh ! You just know $ENTITY keeps that $ENTITY filled with $ENTITY yummy nom-noms ! $ENTITY Do you think she 'd notice if I took a nibble or two ?
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I always thought $ENTITY was hard to talk to , $ENTITY but I did n't expect it 'd be THAT hard ... I gave her a bouquet the other day as a present , $ENTITY but she said she could n't accept it and gave it back . $ENTITY Perhaps she 's not mature enough to receive flowers ...

So , you know , in water . $ENTITY If you look very carefully , you 'll sometimes see the shadow of a fish . $ENTITY When you see a shadow , aim for near the fish 's head and press to cast your line . Make sure you have your fishing rod equipped first , of course ! $ENTITY If the fish realizes something 's there , it 'll move closer to it . $ENTITY Once it bites and the bobber drops below the water 's surface , press again to reel it in ! $ENTITY If you press the button quick enough before it gets away , you can catch it . Give it a try . And good luck !

For example , someone who 's caught a lot of different kinds of bugs ... .
$ENTITY and $ENTITY are two peas in a pod . $ENTITY They shop together , eat together , play together ... $ENTITY I 'm not jealous or anything . I have , like , a bazillion friends . $ENTITY But their relationship is something special !

$ENTITY I should go talk to our neighbor at some point . I hate that we argued , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Yup , $ENTITY used to play that $ENTITY every day ... I have n't heard her play it at all lately ! $ENTITY I wonder if she got tired of it , ... . $ENTITY Nah , $ENTITY that was probably just me .
$ENTITY

ENTITY Umm ... $ENTITY Hi . Did you need something ? $ENTITY I know it 's silly , but if you want to talk about $ENTITY , you 'll need to talk to me over the counter . Or if you want to flex your mayoral muscle , you can sit in the mayor 's chair .
$ENTITY Oh , wow ! $ENTITY What are you doing with ... I 've always wanted one of those ! Let 's make a deal ! $ENTITY Wan na trade your $ENTITY for my ... Sure ! No way !

$ENTITY You guessed it $ENTITY we 're going to play some good old-fashioned $ENTITY hide-and-seek $ENTITY ! This is good , $ENTITY wholesome fun $ENTITY unlike those newfangled space-age vidya games you kids play .
$ENTITY I always come here when I 've got some thinking to do at night . $ENTITY There are too many distractions at my house , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY I plan on asking $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY for a pretty $ENTITY carpet $ENTITY this year .

$ENTITY Is it just me , or is $ENTITY 's head starting to look like a big piece of fruit ? $ENTITY It 's all juicy looking !
$ENTITY Alrighty ! That is some fine hairdo ! Try ta wear it like that more often ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY So c- $ENTITY c- $ENTITY cold ... . When w- $ENTITY w- $ENTITY will it end ?

$ENTITY You never know when a bug might come flying out at you , you know ? $ENTITY That 's why I 'm carrying this net . $ENTITY Uh huh huh ! $ENTITY I 'm all about seizing the day . $ENTITY And this net really helps !
$ENTITY April Fools ' Day $ENTITY only comes once a year , so it would n't be too bad if someone played a trick on me . $ENTITY But if you 're gon na take on the role of $ENTITY , you 'd better be a hottie $ENTITY just like yours truly !
Just as the name of the tour implies , you 're going to go free diving for $ENTITY crab $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Horsehair crab $ENTITY , $ENTITY # x0 ; red king crab $ENTITY , $ENTITY # x0 ; snow crab ... They 're all fair game !
... But I do n't , like , know much about golf ... I 'm sorry ! $ENTITY I 'm not even sure how you came to that conclusion ... . Did we ever talk about golf ? $ENTITY I suppose the clubs ARE sorta cute and shiny ... Well , $ENTITY thanks anyway !
$ENTITY What will we do without your help ?
Huh ? $ENTITY You totally got my hopes up there for a second !
$ENTITY Will it be awkward if I give an acceptance speech after winning first place in the tournament ? $ENTITY , $ENTITY I guess we 'll find out !

$ENTITY Thanks for everything ! $ENTITY And next time you need me , $ENTITY just stare really hard at that $ENTITY picture $ENTITY , $ENTITY OK ? $ENTITY I doubt anything 'll happen , $ENTITY but it will make me feel good knowing someone is looking at me . $ENTITY Everyone in town owes you one . $ENTITY You helped us $ENTITY ALL out today , $ENTITY or so I heard from $ENTITY Blanca $ENTITY .

If you hit the switch , it ... ... The things inside all go ... ... What is it ? One more time ! $ENTITY If you hit the switch , it ... ... The things inside all go ... ... What is it ?
$ENTITY Yeah , this area 's kind of empty ... If I had a ton of money , I would build a huge gym here ! $ENTITY Unfortunately , all my Bells are tied up in petunia-protein futures right now . $ENTITY .
you sure you want to sit down ? You still have items in your pockets ! $ENTITY Since someone requested to go on a tour or go home , if you sit down now ... all the items you 're carrying will be traded in for Bells and the funds will be deposited into your account . This applies to anything you own that you may be holding as well . $ENTITY Items you want to keep should be placed in the $ENTITY Item Drop Box ... Understood . Gim me a sec .
$ENTITY Nice to meetcha ! $ENTITY I 'm ... . $ENTITY You MUST $ENTITY have heard of me ! $ENTITY 'Cause I 've definitely heard of you , ... I can tell right away that we 're gon na be good friends ! $ENTITY Looks like this town could use a little $ENTITY flash and style . $ENTITY And that 's where I come in !
$ENTITY Do you know what floor the boys ' restroom is on ? ... Actually , $ENTITY does this town even have restrooms ?
$ENTITY Mayor , I think all the citizens had a good time today ! $ENTITY It seemed like they were thinking about different aspects of the town 's natural environment !
$ENTITY You look like you 're an expert at netting bugs ! $ENTITY I 'm not that good yet , $ENTITY so I 'm very impressed by your skill !
$ENTITY Well , maybe not overly fancy or even that schmancy , ... but at least it 's in pretty good condition . $ENTITY Whether you use it or sell it is entirely up to you ... . I do n't care either way , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Today 's the big countdown ! ... I get so fidgety on festival days ! $ENTITY GAHAHA !

Thanks ! $ENTITY That 's a great idea , ... .
$ENTITY Oh , ... ! $ENTITY Now that we 're all here , $ENTITY we can sit down and have a nice chat .
$ENTITY Purchasing something is like having a battle with the store clerk ! ... Wait a minute . $ENTITY If I gave them my money , does that mean I lost ?
$ENTITY You 're not gon na eat those beans , are you ? $ENTITY You 're supposed to throw 'em ! But I guess if you eat 'em , they could be a different kind of weapon !
$ENTITY Good morning , ... What ? $ENTITY Is it night already ? $ENTITY So I should say good night instead ? ... The sun does n't come up during the $ENTITY Winter Solstice ... so I have no idea what time it is , ... .
$ENTITY Nice ... Fossils are something a meathead like me can get excited about ! $ENTITY They offer two great workouts : digging them up and lugging them all over ... Ha ha ! $ENTITY I should start a class ! ... I should start a class !

Last time you left without saving your game . $ENTITY So some of what you did last time may be gone . $ENTITY I 'm very sorry . $ENTITY Please remember to $ENTITY save $ENTITY whenever you leave the game , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY likes to keep ... or two ... but she 's conflicted about it . She said she 's not sure it suits her personality , ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey , hey , ... This area has the best air in the entire store , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY you must have come to visit from another town , ... I actually just moved here , myself . $ENTITY It 's great getting visitors so soon !

$ENTITY
Even though $ENTITY is the mayor , ... # x0 ; 's $ENTITY # x0 ; still living in a tent . $ENTITY I guess mayors do n't get paid very well , huh , ... ?
$ENTITY You promised , did n't you ? $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY If I gave you some $ENTITY candy ... you were supposed to leave me alone ...
ENTITY Keep up the good work ! Try to break this record with an even more appetizing bug .
$ENTITY Hmm ... There are two versions of $ENTITY walking around ? $ENTITY Well , that should sound familiar , $ENTITY eh ? $ENTITY You can do better this time , $ENTITY . $ENTITY is counting on you ... Go help ... # x0 ; $ENTITY out !
... . Are you from this town ? $ENTITY I 'm kind of embarrassed that you caught me at a time like this . $ENTITY You 'll have to excuse me . $ENTITY I 've caught some sort of cold . $ENTITY Hack hack and cough cough ! $ENTITY I moved here from a town called ... a while back . $ENTITY The name 's $ENTITY most days . $ENTITY ... . Once I get better , $ENTITY we 'll have to meet up for real ... !
ENTITY Yes ! Yes ! $ENTITY Oh so fresh ! $ENTITY Feel the breeze ! ... Pav $ENTITY is pleased ! ... SOOTHING ... ... ... $ENTITY FESTIVALE $ENTITY ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY Gyaaaaaaaaaaaahhh ! ... I 'll give you $ENTITY candy $ENTITY ! Just go away ! $ENTITY But your pockets are full , $ENTITY bro ! $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY
If you hit a rock $ENTITY with an axe or shovel , sometimes that rock will crack open and reveal a treasure ! $ENTITY I just love treasure hunts , ... !
$ENTITY I am $ENTITY SO not ready for this ! It 's a serious faux pas $ENTITY to forget to wear countdown gear $ENTITY to the countdown !
$ENTITY Happy New Year ! $ENTITY The year $ENTITY has started ! $ENTITY Let 's see ... Which part of my body should I focus on toning up ? $ENTITY Your arms ! Your calves ! Your abs ! Your back !
...
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY You really feel that way ?
$ENTITY Thanks for wrangling this for me ! $ENTITY You deserve a reward !
... I feel like $ENTITY I should salute you or something . $ENTITY Such a dapper mayor ! $ENTITY But seriously , thanks for making $ENTITY a better place ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait to see $ENTITY what you do next !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY it 's you , ... Welcome back , ... We 're all so glad that our mayor is back in town ! $ENTITY We missed you , ... !

$ENTITY
Hold on a second . $ENTITY Is n't it rude of us to be snooping around like this ? $ENTITY OK , $ENTITY I just wanted to confirm that . $ENTITY Now $ENTITY let 's continue snooping .
$ENTITY Signatures for the club ? $ENTITY I feel like I might have signed this before ... But whatever ! ... I 'm totally on board , so I 'll sign again if you think I can get away with it !
Horned dynastids are part of the scarab family . Their horns are actually part of their exoskeleton . Horned dynastids do n't have a nose or ears , but they can sense smells with their antennae . They are also able to feel the minor vibration of sounds traveling in the air using thin hair on their bodies . They are fairly loud when flying , plus they emit a rather sour odor , so they are hard not to notice .
time my dilemma involves a friend . $ENTITY Truth be told , an old acquaintance named $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY . He is a master coffee brewer ... . But this fellow has no place where he can put his skills to use ! $ENTITY So why not open a caf here in $ENTITY ? Visitors would love it ... . Imagine , $ENTITY if I may say , $ENTITY the good buzz !
$ENTITY Great ! $ENTITY Thank you ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Thanks for coming up with such a great idea , ... !

$ENTITY Those clothes you 're wearing really turn things up to 11 !
's exactly what it looks like . It 's a $ENTITY persimmon ... Sure , you can eat it , but my intent was to have it grown outside . $ENTITY All you have to do is plant it from your $ENTITY pockets $ENTITY when you 're outside , so it 's easylike a tree ! $ENTITY But $ENTITY you got ta be careful not to plant it too close to another tree or in the shade . $ENTITY Doing that will cause it to wither , and then it 'll never grow up all big !
$ENTITY Huh ? What 's going on here ? How can this item be so cheap ? $ENTITY It 's got ta be a mistake , right ? $ENTITY Buy it ! Do n't buy it !
$ENTITY Of course ! I ca n't wait to see you in it ! Gracie Homme turns any boy into a full-fledged hunk , darling .

$ENTITY Oh , hi ! $ENTITY Are you as pleased about the weather as I am , $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY I just love rainy nights ! I could n't possibly waste them indoors , ...

$ENTITY I feel like I just keep running into you today , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh ? ! $ENTITY Is this really for me ? ... Heh heh . $ENTITY I wonder what 's inside ...

$ENTITY I love it , even if it 's not exactly what I wanted . Who can say no to such a sweet flavor , $ENTITY ?

...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY So you want it short , $ENTITY ? Well , let me think . $ENTITY Short is simple , I guess . $ENTITY But is it right for you ? I think you 're pretty fabulous . $ENTITY Maybe you should consider being as fabulous on the outside . $ENTITY But if anyone can look like a million Bells with short hair , it 's you , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY When you think of this country , $ENTITY you probably think of Vikings . $ENTITY Big , strong guys with dragon boats ! $ENTITY I was a viking once , ... but I could never get the hang of pillaging , $ENTITY so I gave it up for standard sailing . $ENTITY Plus this country is n't just Vikings . $ENTITY Nah , it 's also mermaid princesses ! $ENTITY They say that REAL mermaids actually live there . $ENTITY # xE ; ... Not those fake , manatee ones ! $ENTITY Oh , lovely mermaid princess ... I was on my way to your country to meet you at last ! $ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait a second longer ! $ENTITY Do you have an idea of where I was most likely headed ?

$ENTITY But still , $ENTITY there 's no point in having tons of the same thing . So I 've decided to get rid of this item ... . $ENTITY Would you have any interest in buying it from me ? ! $ENTITY How would $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY sound ? $ENTITY Sounds good ! Not a chance .
$ENTITY Oh , that 's right . I remember a bit ago that $ENTITY told me about needing something to weigh fruit . $ENTITY I guess she snagged that scale so she could do it ... . But why in the world would you weigh fruit ?
$ENTITY Hi there ... Snow days totally make me lose track of time , ... .
$ENTITY Why does $ENTITY have $ENTITY in her house ? $ENTITY It 's a mystery !

Appearances are , like , totally deceiving . ''

$ENTITY The $ENTITY fireworks show $ENTITY is only a few days away ! $ENTITY I look forward to these shows all year long .

$ENTITY Yoo-hoo $ENTITY , ... Let 's dance ! $ENTITY We 've really got to live it up $ENTITY in honor of $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 've never thought of $ENTITY as a particularly large guy , $ENTITY but he has this $ENTITY . $ENTITY He still probably manages to kick the covers off in the night .
Coffee , please ! $ENTITY With $ENTITY 3 $ENTITY sugars !
$ENTITY Hey ! I see you 're still rocking your ... You 're really getting into the whole bad- $ENTITY # x0 ; y $ENTITY # x0 ; i $ENTITY # x0 ; thing , huh ? $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I see . $ENTITY Sorry for bothering you ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY But ... I 'm not in love ! ...
$ENTITY said that if you talk to plants , $ENTITY it helps them grow . $ENTITY The thing I always get stuck on is $ENTITY what to talk about . $ENTITY Like , what are you supposed to say ? $ENTITY `` How 's that dirt treating you ? '' $ENTITY `` How are your roots doing ? '' $ENTITY It 's kind of awkward .
$ENTITY This is n't some trashy garage sale , darling . Every single item here is a GracieGrace original ! For some folks , $ENTITY it 's the only way they 'll ever get their hooves on such a piece of fashion history !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Did n't $ENTITY say he wanted to build a drinking fountain ? $ENTITY Looks like that project may have gotten a little bit out of control ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I wonder if there 's anyone who 'd want to watch them with me ... .
... Oh , man ! Wrong one again ! $ENTITY Maybe it 's just not your lucky day ?
CLOSED -
$ENTITY
$ENTITY So the awards ceremony has been canceled . $ENTITY That 's too bad ... . I hope we have a ceremony next time !
$ENTITY I 've been clearing the clutter out of my room , and now I 've got a lot of empty space . $ENTITY I think what I need to fill the space $ENTITY is a really big piece of furniture . $ENTITY If you find one , $ENTITY will you get it for me ?
$ENTITY Whoa , $ENTITY ! Seems like you 're handling your duties as a mayor pretty well ! $ENTITY I 'm impressed ! $ENTITY Keep up the good work , Mayor $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Then stop loitering around , and let 's go to my house already ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I got rid of some stress by dropping some money ! Shopping therapy !
$ENTITY Hey , ... !
$ENTITY seems like the type of girl who 'd jam a bunch of books into that $ENTITY .
If you do n't wan na be tricked , you better walk around with some $ENTITY candy $ENTITY on you !
$ENTITY Ahh ... you 're talking about my great fragrance spray ! ... The one with the lavender smell ... It made your room smell great ! $ENTITY But I guess you did n't like it , huh ? $ENTITY Well , I have no choice then ... . If I create a breeze , it 'll go away . $ENTITY One , two , $ENTITY three ! $ENTITY Hah ha ! $ENTITY Now it 's back to normal ! ... Er , well ... It will be soon enough .
We 're deep into autumn now ... . I bet all you think about are the piles of leaves all over ... . $ENTITY Well , I find myself getting very sentimental this time of year . $ENTITY If I were gon na equate life to some sort of journey , $ENTITY then $ENTITY would just be a stop along my path ! $ENTITY I 'm thinking it 's about time I moved on to a new town . $ENTITY I 've decided to move on the $ENTITY of next month . $ENTITY Do n't go ! Have a safe trip !
$ENTITY is a sample used for exterior renovations , yes ? $ENTITY This is but one way owners of large homes can change their style in just a snap !
$ENTITY Heh heh heh ... You 're so cautious ! $ENTITY Maybe you want to wait and see the other stuff , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Fair enough ! $ENTITY Here 's the second one ! ... for $ENTITY Bells $ENTITY ! $ENTITY How 's that ? $ENTITY I 'll buy it ! I wo n't buy it .
$ENTITY Well , huh . $ENTITY listened to stuff like ... That 's quite surprising ... But it 's also really cool !
$ENTITY I 'm trying to think of a nickname for myself for the new year . $ENTITY Such as ...
... Seems like such a long time ago .
$ENTITY Hey , did you see it ? ... Her ... It 's so tiny ! $ENTITY I bet if you 're not careful , you 'd easily overlook it ! D'awww , ...
$ENTITY I 've been waiting for this day since ... oh , $ENTITY about this time last year ! $ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Time to think up some sophisticated lies !
$ENTITY I ca n't believe it 's been a week already ... Oh , oops ! $ENTITY I drifted off in thought for a moment . $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY it 's you ! $ENTITY Did you know I live in $ENTITY now ? $ENTITY I 'm excited about being your new neighbor . Originally I moved at the request of someone else , $ENTITY but I can see now it was a great decision anyway .
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY 's here today ! $ENTITY You gon na go check out his stuff ? $ENTITY I do n't know a lot about art , $ENTITY but I always want to see the shady stuff he 's got ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY My dream ? ! $ENTITY I have one ! I really do ! ... Ummm , it 's ... .
$ENTITY This place is pretty dreamy , huh ! $ENTITY Have fun , ... .
I 'm still pretty new at my job , $ENTITY so learning all the ins and outs has proved to be a challenge ... But if a new home is on display or visitors come to peruse , I feel like all my hard work has been worth it !
$ENTITY You look like a pro wrestler today ! $ENTITY Wow ! You totally nailed it ! You went all out ! $ENTITY Heh heh ! If you 're wearing that tomorrow , we 'll have to have a championship match , $ENTITY !
... =
$ENTITY Oh yeah , that 's right , ... Thanks for helping me the other day when I was all sick ! ... ! $ENTITY I was kinda getting desperate $ENTITY and probably did n't look so good . $ENTITY But thanks to you , $ENTITY I 'm all recovered , as you can clearly see ! $ENTITY It 's not much , $ENTITY but here . You can have my $ENTITY !
Do n't mind if I do !
$ENTITY You know , she 's a little , $ENTITY well , $ENTITY rough around the edges . I 'm just tickled pink to get it back at all .
$ENTITY So $ENTITY we meet again , $ENTITY ? All this $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY sun must be making you extra peppy !
It seems we do n't have any events for the next few days , ... But maybe it 's a test to see what you would do in a situation like this , $ENTITY . $ENTITY For example , ... you could stage an elaborate play based on my life ! $ENTITY And I could star in it ! $ENTITY You see all the radically different and wonderful things you could do ?
Yuck ! $ENTITY Tastes like cherry shoe polish ! ... But thanks , $ENTITY ! I bet this will do the trick ! ... !
$ENTITY Thanks for coming today ! ... Everyone has some beans and is waiting to begin !
$ENTITY Oh boy ... It is SO not like me $ENTITY to be all blue . $ENTITY Why ca n't I just be happy again ?
OK , I 'm outta here . $ENTITY Nice chat . $ENTITY , thanks for taking the time to come and get me !
$ENTITY Heya , ... I am super pumped to be alive ! $ENTITY One ! $ENTITY Two ! $ENTITY One ! $ENTITY Two !
Inside that $ENTITY is some curry I made the other day ... . Is it starting to smell funky ? !
$ENTITY When you 've got $ENTITY pan-fried red snapper ... you ca n't forget to put some $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY on it ! $ENTITY Really , I could eat just about any dish that has that sour taste ... Basically , add $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY to $ENTITY fish $ENTITY is what I 'm tellin ' you ! ... !
$ENTITY Well , what have we here ? It 's my old ... And there 's a letter inside ? ... The plot thickens , ... I think ... . it 's from me .
$ENTITY Yahoo ! $ENTITY I 'm warming up ! $ENTITY We 're getting started ! ... !
$ENTITY I ca n't believe it ! This is the $ENTITY Why , you 're just the best , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You know , I 've been really good this year , $ENTITY so I 'm gon na ask $ENTITY Jingle ... for some new $ENTITY wallpaper $ENTITY .
Pockets just are n't big enough ! $ENTITY Sometimes I pick a lot of fruit and there 's nowhere to put it all . $ENTITY But I found out a little secret : $ENTITY you can build a pile of fruit in your pockets ! It 's super easy . $ENTITY If you select a bunch of the same kind of fruit , $ENTITY you can put it all in one place . Like , up to nine fruits ! $ENTITY That should give you a little extra room so you can carry all your other fun stuff ! Totally convenient !
This ... is the one you want , right ? ... Let 's see what your last card is ... . You got the cosmos ! $ENTITY Oh boy , $ENTITY that 's too bad . $ENTITY You did n't win a single round this game ...
Uh-oh ... That 's not a good question to ask , ... .
$ENTITY Oh $ENTITY dear ! $ENTITY I 'm feeling ever so woozy ! $ENTITY Pray tell , what was $ENTITY IN this apple ?
... -but this is trash ! ... Oh , ... you 're such a kidder . $ENTITY You wo n't get me to take this to Re-Tail for you !
Oh ! ... It gets so humid on rainy days ... $ENTITY Dampness from sweat is the way to go . Dampness from rain ... $ENTITY not so much , $ENTITY .
I 've never tried it , ... but I 'll bet dried angelfish tastes pretty close to jerky . Just a theory , of course . $ENTITY Right now I 'm just gon na eat it raw to save myself some time ... . YUM !
to ...
Ooh ! $ENTITY is hooked up in ... ! $ENTITY Makes total sense . I mean , $ENTITY how else is he gon na end up working out his thumbs ?
$ENTITY Hey , thanks for delivering that package ! $ENTITY Did $ENTITY say anything about it ? $ENTITY Actually ... I ca n't remember .
Hey , ... do you know the difference between real coffee and a coffee drink ? $ENTITY Real coffee , $ENTITY like the stuff $ENTITY Brewster $ENTITY serves here , $ENTITY is simply made from roasted and ground coffee beans . $ENTITY A coffee drink could be anything . $ENTITY You never know what you 're getting .
$ENTITY Stores like this are much more my speed than fancy-schmancy stores . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It will probably look something like this when it 's all finished ... . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I saw $ENTITY smiling at herself in her ... It was pretty cute 'cause she 's usually so serious , ... .
$ENTITY Hey , we have nothing else to do ... Wan na play a game ?
$ENTITY How many stomachs do you have ? ! ... And how is that possible ? !
$ENTITY Yes ! $ENTITY Just the answer I was hoping for ! $ENTITY All right , let 's get going then !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I 've prepared a little something to celebrate $ENTITY Starcrossed Day ... Please stop by when you 've made some room in your pockets for it !
$ENTITY All that ? $ENTITY That 's not chili ! $ENTITY That 's stew ! $ENTITY You ca n't just go changing decades of chili-making tradition !
$ENTITY Do you think $ENTITY watches lots of cooking shows on her TV , ... ? $ENTITY 'Cause I do !
$ENTITY Even if they 've just got the same old furniture everyone has ... people can put their personalities into it !
$ENTITY Well , I really love this town ... . Camping here has been a lot of fun , ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY How many times have you seen a superintendent ? Yeah , think about THAT , maaaaaan ... $ENTITY
$ENTITY You really have a good eye for this kind of thing , $ENTITY !
... Hmm ... That 's just not my style . $ENTITY Signature drives are for people who want to join forces , right ? $ENTITY See , I 'm more of a go-it-alone type . $ENTITY I rely on my own abilities . $ENTITY Anyway , this petition seems silly .
$ENTITY So about $ENTITY Brewster ... They say he can hear everything that gets said in this place . $ENTITY So no matter how hard we try to be secretive , $ENTITY he hears it all . $ENTITY Like ... # x0 ;
My dream is for everyone to find something they can be passionate about and to fully enjoy each day . That 's why the badges this old man gives out are recognition of the love people have for their hobbies . $ENTITY ! '' $ENTITY
Anyway , what did you come to chat about , $ENTITY ?
... Is n't it the other way around ? ... You get that kind of body after you 've mastered $ENTITY ?
like all the summers before , this one sure is hot ... Every year around this time , $ENTITY our sleeveless line of clothing picks up in sales like you would n't believe .
Well , I 'd better change out of this then .

$ENTITY I thought it 'd be fun to get together . You know , $ENTITY just us girls . $ENTITY But maybe some other time .
$ENTITY What ? ! $ENTITY No ! $ENTITY I just could n't get my hand up in time ! $ENTITY I have allergies ! ... This is all your fault !
$ENTITY Hmm ... . I wo n't know until I try it , but that could work , ... !

$ENTITY Hey ! Good evening $ENTITY ! What a lovely night , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I see . I see ... Something stylish , huh ? $ENTITY Then let me ask you one last thing ... Is the reason you want to be stylish because you want to be a fashion leader everyone looks up to ? Or are you more the opposite ? $ENTITY Is a prickly , don't-get-too-close- $ENTITY to-me aura more your ideal ? $ENTITY I 'm a role model ! I like being left alone !
$ENTITY You really came through for me !
$ENTITY I appreciate your fire , but there are rules you must follow ! First : no shoes , no service . Second : no accessory , no analysis ! An outfit is simply not complete without both of those things . $ENTITY Now stop wasting my time , and go prep yourself before hassling me again .
$ENTITY When you 're making a pie with lots of $ENTITY different fruits $ENTITY in it , you ca n't use sugar ! $ENTITY The fruits will give you all the sweetness you need , $ENTITY so use it ! $ENTITY Still , I think a little $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY would enhance the flavor ... Yeah , $ENTITY that does n't sound bad ! $ENTITY !
... # x0 ; a $ENTITY # x0 ; d $ENTITY e ! I think I reached a new level of metaphysical fitness during cartwheel training yesterday . $ENTITY For a moment , everything went white ! Then , beyond the light , I saw an image of $ENTITY floating by ... It was crazy ! I felt like I had reached a new plane of muscle consciousness ! Or maybe I was just dizzy after cartwheeling all over the place . $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Tonight 's the countdown ! ... I do n't know whether to chill at home $ENTITY or go to the plaza ... What do I do ? $ENTITY It 's my last big dilemma of the year , ... !

$ENTITY Home sweet home . Now excuse me while I unlock the door ... .
$ENTITY I love breathing the air in new places ... . It 's especially refreshing in the winter !
$ENTITY So . Your $ENTITY . $ENTITY Let 's talk points . Not worth much . Boom . However ... Did cause a stir . My crew ? Still scratching their heads . Wondering what makes you tick ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Yar ! I just noticed ... You have real purty eyelashes , $ENTITY
$ENTITY Waaaaah ! $ENTITY I hope $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY is n't avoiding me !

$ENTITY You 're an old pro , $ENTITY eh ? ... All right then , $ENTITY let 's play . $ENTITY Pick a card , $ENTITY any card . $ENTITY The left card . The middle card . The right card .

$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY It 's from $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Well , I 'm sure my current catchphrase will be fine for a little longer .
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY Going home already ? $ENTITY Before you go , ... tell me what you think of my place ! $ENTITY It 's great ! It 's fine . Meh .
So I guess the awards ceremony was canceled ... . , $ENTITY that 's weird . $ENTITY Oh well . $ENTITY That just means more time for $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Good evening , $ENTITY ! It 's been like evening ever since morning . $ENTITY SO weird , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY It 's all about $ENTITY feathers ... You got ta grab the feathers floating around ! $ENTITY There are lots of different colors , so it gets sorta confusing ... But just grab as many as ya can !
By the by $ENTITY , $ENTITY you can dry out the meat of a pearl oyster for quite a tasty meal . It 's chewy ! ... Not that I mind $ENTITY just eating them whole like this ! ... YUM !
$ENTITY Hmmm ... Kinda small , do n't you think ? ... How about something bigger , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY I ca n't believe you 're using an umbrella on a day like this . $ENTITY Do n't tell me ... You 're protecting yourself from the sweat flying off my body , right ? ! $ENTITY Well , here 's some more sweat for you then ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hello , $ENTITY ! Have you heard that the sun is n't going down tonight ? $ENTITY So much extra time to see and BE seen here in $ENTITY , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
... I 'm sorry . $ENTITY I ca n't serve you any more today ...
$ENTITY I 'll just try this on .
Sorry , $ENTITY but I 'm trying to save enough money to buy something else and ca n't just give it to you ...
All right , ... Tomorrow is $ENTITY Weeding Day ... and you know what that means , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY Wear your sunscreen !
$ENTITY You do n't see starry skies like this too often , do you ? ! $ENTITY Heh heh ! It 's gon na be great training under the stars later , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY If you do n't like my present , $ENTITY you can give it away or sell it . $ENTITY I would understand .
$ENTITY Ha ! ... And some refurbishing 's been done !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I should really head home . $ENTITY But wow , today was $ENTITY fun , was n't it ?
$ENTITY Hmm ... Perfect ! $ENTITY Now you fit right in with today 's festivities .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY My name 's ... There was this person a while back who made a really passionate plea for me to move here . $ENTITY I ended up packing my stuff and moving from $ENTITY all the way here ! However , when I asked about $ENTITY at the town hall , $ENTITY I was told $ENTITY # x0 ; 'd $ENTITY # x0 ; already left town ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY I look like a fool , do n't I ? $ENTITY Anyway , $ENTITY I suppose that 's just my bum luck ... . But I hope I can count on you ! ... !

$ENTITY Is there a such thing as being TOO glamorous ? ... Because if there is , $ENTITY I am guilty as charged . $ENTITY And it 's partially thanks to this $ENTITY outfit . $ENTITY Do n't you agree , ... ?
$ENTITY Here we go ! $ENTITY We have less than a minute now ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Really ? ... If that 's what you want ... .
$ENTITY Did you come all this way just to say hi to me , ... It 's me , ... You have n't forgotten me , have you ? $ENTITY I live here in town now . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY now that we 're neighbors , $ENTITY I hope you come over to chat a lot . $ENTITY

$ENTITY
Well , $ENTITY so much for sleeping tonight . $ENTITY I 'm on the one-way express to insomnia-ville . $ENTITY Yeah , $ENTITY that means I 've had too much coffee . $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Since I 've been gone , $ENTITY has really improved his house a ton ! $ENTITY Well , not that I actually remember how it looked before ... . GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
You know the awards ceremony already happened , do n't you ? $ENTITY Let 's go together next time , ... .
ENTITY Well , $ENTITY the $ENTITY Bell Boom $ENTITY ordinance is already active , $ENTITY so let 's keep working hard to boost the town 's economy !
ENTITY Oh ... I actually ca n't accept letters addressed to $ENTITY right now ... This person 's mailbox is overflowing with letters , $ENTITY so we ca n't make any more deliveries to that box . $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY If you want to do something about it , $ENTITY talk to $ENTITY directly .
$ENTITY Oh , that ? ... , you 've seen $ENTITY before , yes ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY Out with bad ogres ... In with $ENTITY good fairies ! $ENTITY

Time 's up ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Huh ? ... is calling for me ? ... Man , $ENTITY everyone relies on me all the time ... . You ever feel like that ? $ENTITY Well , I guess I really have no choice ! ... All right , lead the way , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY You 're pretty scatterbrained , are n't you ?

$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY OK ... I guess not everyone likes flowers . $ENTITY Or learning about themselves .

$ENTITY I never knew you had so many interesting stories to tell . $ENTITY We should talk more ! $ENTITY !
Holding a fishing rod really makes your arms tired after a while ... !

Hermit crabs live in empty shells they can fit their bodies into . As they grow , they find bigger shells . They 're quite picky about each new shell and first measure the opening with their claws . The shells they choose usually fit well , and they 'll sometimes fight one another over ownership rights .
You do n't like this rain , do you , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY I ca n't stand this stuff , $ENTITY .

$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Quite the moon fan , are n't you ? ... You 're talking about when the moon is half lit and half dark , right ? $ENTITY Seeing the moon like that ... so perfectly cut in half ... ... It almost makes me nervous ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY So right now I 'm just camping here , $ENTITY but pretty soon I 'll be moving to this town for good ! $ENTITY invited me , actually ... . We should hang out once I 'm moved in , ... .

$ENTITY If you 're in the mood for a really rich meal to savor , $ENTITY shellfish chowder $ENTITY always hits the spot . $ENTITY But if you only use cream , $ENTITY your chowder wo n't be as rich as it could be . $ENTITY The trick is to add plenty of $ENTITY butter ...

$ENTITY The easiest way to get excited about cleaning is getting the right supplies . $ENTITY I bet $ENTITY is pumped about using her $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Well . Your $ENTITY . Did n't hurt your score . That 's for sure ! Big plus . Big points . $ENTITY Feels like it was n't easy to obtain . Took some effort , right ? A risk maybe ?

$ENTITY Oh ! What a flavor sensation ! ... I am in looooove with this fruit ! There 's nothing like it , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Are you serious ? $ENTITY You 're one of those infernal spaghetti slurpers ? ... You guys drive me nuts ! $ENTITY Let me give you a quick lesson . $ENTITY First , $ENTITY twirl the spaghetti on your fork .

$ENTITY Hey , ... Getting hungry ? $ENTITY 'Cause I 'm hungry , ... .
$ENTITY What ? Our neighbor actually liked what I sent over ? $ENTITY Huh . $ENTITY I was n't sure that would happen .
... a word of caution . At our suite , we hope to provide clients with only the most pleasant dreams . However , some clients have spoken of unpleasant dreams or even what they 'd consider nightmares . $ENTITY When you awaken , I 'll ask you how your dream was . $ENTITY If you had a nightmare , $ENTITY please let me know right away . $ENTITY With that knowledge , $ENTITY I 'll make sure to never choose that dream for you ever again . $ENTITY Now , if you choose to seek out a dream on your own rather than leaving the decision to me ... . I will not stop you , nor will I ask for your opinion afterward . $ENTITY I want to make sure you understand how the system works so you can enjoy our suite to the fullest .
$ENTITY I 've prepared a little something to celebrate $ENTITY Groundhog Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY Would you like to see what it is ?
$ENTITY I had this intense dream that ... fell out of the sky and landed in $ENTITY . $ENTITY And $ENTITY thought it was the most amazing thing that ever happened to our town ! So , Mayor , are you going to make our dreams come true ? It 's all up to you , ...
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY You live in this town , $ENTITY do n't you ? $ENTITY My name is $ENTITY ! I actually just moved from $ENTITY today , ... . I 'm still trying to get things done since this is my first day and all ... But once the dust settles , $ENTITY I 'd like to chat some more !

$ENTITY
I caught a giant snakehead ! But where 's the rest of the snake ? ... in . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Sunny days in spring have a unique , springy smell ... . Do you think maybe it 's all the cherry blossoms ? $ENTITY That aroma gets me super excited ! ... My festival senses start getting all tingly , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ho ! ... That 's great ! Just like ... Looking at it makes me feel full of energy ! It 's the magic-est of fruits !
$ENTITY I 've prepared a little something to celebrate $ENTITY Naughty-or-Nice Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY Would you like to see ?
$ENTITY But , man ... if I wear this , everyone is gon na laugh at me !
$ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Halloween ... I want candy ! Let 's talk .
$ENTITY Hey , ... Happy birthday ! $ENTITY You 're one year older and that much $ENTITY more grown up now ! Or at least you are definitely a year older ! $ENTITY But I guess in your case , $ENTITY you gain four years of growth all at once ... So you really grow by leaps and bounds ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY It 's a unique style , $ENTITY I know . $ENTITY But I bet you could make any outfit work . $ENTITY Tap on the Touch Screen to look in your pockets . $ENTITY Drag the $ENTITY onto yourself to wear it . $ENTITY Or tap on clothing and then select $ENTITY Wear $ENTITY . $ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY While we 're on the subject , $ENTITY I have a useful tip for you . $ENTITY Tees $ENTITY are shirts with short sleeves , $ENTITY and $ENTITY tanks $ENTITY do n't have any sleeves . $ENTITY If you put your shirt on backward ... . $ENTITY you 're on your own , ... .
ENTITY I see . $ENTITY That 's quite all right .
$ENTITY Congratulations ! You hit 30,000 points ! $ENTITY

$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY Where did you go in the middle of our game of hide-and-seek ? $ENTITY I was hiding , $ENTITY but no one seemed to be searching , $ENTITY so we called off the game , ... .
... you really should n't hide your tea-fanatic side like that .
$ENTITY Did bugs get this ? ! ... They ate like half of it ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY My neck hurts $ENTITY from staring up at all these beautiful fireworks , $ENTITY but it 's totally worth it ! $ENTITY You know you can press up $ENTITY on to look up at the sky , right ? $ENTITY You get the best view that way !
$ENTITY Thanks , ... Hopefully this will patch up a friendship again !
$ENTITY This ... Do you think it looks like me ? $ENTITY I do ! $ENTITY That 's probably why I like it so much ! $ENTITY !

the way , did you know $ENTITY that you can EAT these eggs ? $ENTITY If you eat one and find a $ENTITY winning ticket $ENTITY in it , please bring it back to me for a gift ! Whimmity wham !
, $ENTITY is there anything else I can $ENTITY help you with ? $ENTITY Send mail . No , thanks .
, $ENTITY well ... a moment ago , I ran into someone named $ENTITY Saharah ... I think she said something about having to change the carpet and wallpaper or ... something ... Ah , $ENTITY my apologies ! $ENTITY I had trouble hearing what she was saying . $ENTITY I 'll pay more attention $ENTITY in the future ...
$ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY You totally forgot about delivering that present to $ENTITY , did n't you ? $ENTITY Well , it 's not doing either of us any good , so I 'll take it back .

$ENTITY You ready for a shocker ? $ENTITY I ... I 'm shakin ' the dust of this town off my feet . $ENTITY Yup . $ENTITY I 'm movin ' out ! $ENTITY I mean , I ca n't just stay in $ENTITY for the rest of my life ... I 've got too much I want to do ! $ENTITY I got ta run wild ! $ENTITY You can understand that , right ? $ENTITY Anyway , I 'm leaving on the $ENTITY of next month ... OK ? $ENTITY Not OK ! Later , gator .
$ENTITY
He 's very energetic and active . $ENTITY I 'd consider him a mood maker here in $ENTITY !
Actually , $ENTITY 's special ability is ... Now that I think about it , $ENTITY their skill at $ENTITY really is kind of spectacular ... You believe me , right ? $ENTITY You have to know this is n't just another $ENTITY April Fools ' Day $ENTITY fib !
$ENTITY I plan on asking $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY for $ENTITY clothing ... Something to freshen up my look .
$ENTITY Oh , that 's NOT it ? $ENTITY Well then , what should it really be ?
$ENTITY All right ! $ENTITY Time to shatter the old delivery record , $ENTITY whatever that was . $ENTITY My target time is ... three seconds !
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY But I was really hoping to make up with $ENTITY !
Ah , what 's that ? ! $ENTITY Ya know this is a festival , right ? That 's a shame ... .
$ENTITY Should you go after the big ones ? $ENTITY Or is it better to go after the rare ones ? $ENTITY Tough choices ! $ENTITY Of course , the big , rare ones are the best option ! ... GAHAHA ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY My package got sent to $ENTITY 's place ? ... I hope it was n't too much trouble for ... # x0 ; $ENTITY . $ENTITY By the way , $ENTITY I noticed most of the wrapping is missing ... Did $ENTITY open it ? ! $ENTITY Actually , it was me . Maaaaybe .

$ENTITY They ca n't just sing and dance ! $ENTITY People look up to pop stars ! $ENTITY So they have to use their influence . I think they should encourage people to read more ! $ENTITY So they should sing books on stage ! $ENTITY Yeah , just imagine if I did that with $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I 'd finally be a star , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Yes ! ... # x0 ; $ENTITY My wish came true ... Thank you so much , $ENTITY Santa !
$ENTITY Might be nice to keep the $ENTITY candy $ENTITY you collect today for yourself instead of giving it to $ENTITY Jack ... Who does n't get a craving for sweets after working out all day ? $ENTITY
$ENTITY I 'm already looking forward to the next $ENTITY fireworks show $ENTITY , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Since it 's $ENTITY Daeboreum $ENTITY , I put together a nice bowl of $ENTITY bureom ... Bureom refers to tree nuts like $ENTITY walnuts and pine nuts . $ENTITY What I 'm giving you is just for decoration , $ENTITY so while you ca n't eat it , ... you can enjoy bureom in spirit !
, $ENTITY OK. Never mind then .
Ho ho ! $ENTITY If it is n't ol ' ... Welcome to town , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I swear I brought you here for a $ENTITY SUPER-important reason . $ENTITY I need your help , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I 'm doing a town survey , and I need to get your opinion . $ENTITY What 's the most fun thing to do around here ?
$ENTITY Hey , ... Next time we meet we 'll practically be neighbors . $ENTITY How about that ?
$ENTITY Then let 's play ... charades ... # x0 ;
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Pretty snazzy , $ENTITY ! All dressed up for a fancy dance or something , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Wait . There 'd better NOT be a dance , because no one invited me , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY The owner of the place was a super-nice lady ! $ENTITY I was really able to kick back and relax ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Take a look at you , ... Is that ensemble $ENTITY supposed to be your tribute to Santa ? $ENTITY Very nice !
$ENTITY The moon tonight is so special ! $ENTITY It 's almost as if it 's shouting , `` Welcome , $ENTITY ! ''
$ENTITY Guess I 'll just have to nom on the perfect fruit $ENTITY some other time . $ENTITY But thanks for this , ... !
I caught an empty can ! Aw , maaaan ...
$ENTITY I 'd like to order a cup of coffee , if you do n't mind !
So you 're the new mayor ... . I 'm ... It 's good to meet you ! $ENTITY I ca n't wait to see the way our town is going to change now that you 're here . $ENTITY Specifically , $ENTITY I 'm hoping we 'll get some fruit trees here besides $ENTITY trees , ... .
$ENTITY The money game is full of dangers . $ENTITY If you 're going for turnips , be sure to remind yourself of the risk ! $ENTITY
ENTITY Man , $ENTITY it 's raining cats and dogs out here today ! ... Sorry . $ENTITY Is that rude ? $ENTITY I do n't want to upset any of our feline or canine residents .
$ENTITY is a friend of yours , right ? $ENTITY I might be off base here , but ... # x0 ; strikes me as a real `` $ENTITY `` type . $ENTITY What do you think ? $ENTITY Am I right ? $ENTITY I 'm really curious !
$ENTITY I wonder how the $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY will go today . $ENTITY I 'm looking forward to meeting all kinds of neat bugs !
$ENTITY All right , $ENTITY how about this ? ... I 'll just give this to you for free ! ... It 's my way of saying thanks for the help !
Then does that make this room ... . your bathroom , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Howdy , ... Today is the $ENTITY Summer Solstice ... so it stays light even at night . $ENTITY I can sit outside all night eating $ENTITY if I want !
$ENTITY That hat of yours is pretty cool ! ... Mine 's not half bad either , right ? $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY When you have a limited number of Bells , $ENTITY you have to be a careful shopper . $ENTITY Unlike me ...
... Yeah , $ENTITY this is n't quite what I was looking for . $ENTITY I think it had the right $ENTITY amount of milk $ENTITY , but that 's about it ... OK , later then , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Nice ... Having some plants in your home can really improve your mood . $ENTITY I mean , just look at my mood ... . Instantly improved ! ... .
$ENTITY It 's all right , ... I did say I would try to answer anything , ... I have walked this earth ... for 250 years !
$ENTITY We should be heading to your home , not going to the beach !
$ENTITY Raising fish can be a challenge . $ENTITY I 've been doing lots of research on the best food and correct water temperature for them .
$ENTITY I 'm so excited ! $ENTITY My award will look perfect on my bookshelf , $ENTITY right next to my books about fishing .
... Huh ? $ENTITY Did n't scare ya ? $ENTITY Aw , man ! $ENTITY I messed up ! $ENTITY !
Nothing ? Then we definitely do n't have taste in the same things , $ENTITY !
... I finally found you ! $ENTITY It 's me , ... . $ENTITY I 've been here for weeks ! $ENTITY It 's funny , $ENTITY I was just camping here when I met $ENTITY , and ... # x0 ; convinced me to move here for real . Now I 'm a full-time $ENTITY resident , $ENTITY and I could n't be happier ! $ENTITY We should get together sometime soon and catch up , $ENTITY OK ? ... !
$ENTITY Like , thanks for having me over . I ca n't wait to see everything , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Cool ! $ENTITY So what do you want to buy ?
$ENTITY 's place has 2 floors ! ... It 's like a secret fortress or something . $ENTITY So cool , ... !
! $ENTITY BINGO ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I find fishing to be quite relaxing sometimes . $ENTITY Just do n't relax during the next tournament , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY Ta-da ! $ENTITY What do you think ? $ENTITY Looks great ! It 's fine . Uh ...
$ENTITY No way ! You lost it ? $ENTITY But that was n't even MINE . Now $ENTITY will be so angry with me !
$ENTITY Heh . Do n't stay mad at me ! $ENTITY Let 's play again sometime !
$ENTITY Well , I asked if you could catch me an $ENTITY ocean fish $ENTITY . Really , any kind will be perfect , $ENTITY !
That 's too bad . Well , maybe we 'll do this another time .
Sea anemones make their homes by attaching to rocks and coral on the bottom of the sea . They use their venomous tentacles to stun fish and shrimp to the point of paralysis and then devour them . The only species of fish with a natural resistance to the venom is the clown fish . Sea anemones and the clown fish nesting in their tentacles make for a rather striking ocean-floor sight .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh my ! ... Did I not give you one of the $ENTITY gifts $ENTITY yet ? Let 's fix that then . $ENTITY Here you go !
'd like to end the display of $ENTITY in exhibit room 3 , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY That 's right ! I changed my mind .
$ENTITY Good for you ! $ENTITY Here . My $ENTITY is yours !
$ENTITY Heh heh ! $ENTITY Seeing as you 've got that slingshot in hand , $ENTITY are you aiming for something in particular ?
$ENTITY
Nice work ! You 've earned a Bronze Tortimer award and $ENTITY # xE ; * ... # x0 ; ls m $ENTITY # x0 ; s $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I 'm having a little spat with $ENTITY Just because I fell asleep during one of ... # x2 ; 0 never-ending stories ... does n't mean $ENTITY # x0 ; needs to get all angry ! $ENTITY Well , I 'm not apologizing ! ... # x0 ; $ENTITY needs to do some serious self-reflection ! ... !
$ENTITY That $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY you gave me really $ENTITY did the trick ! $ENTITY I do n't feel so tired anymore . $ENTITY And I think I 'll get back to my normal workout routine starting tomorrow !
$ENTITY I 'm surprised you 'd say that ... . I mean , $ENTITY I 'm not always so sweet to everyone around me . $ENTITY
$ENTITY Do n't get so down ! $ENTITY It 'll make you stand out from the crowd , right ? $ENTITY Everyone notices a strong smell !
... =
$ENTITY Romantic comedies ? $ENTITY Bleeyeck ! $ENTITY Do you enjoy not having your heart pound and not getting excited ?
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems you now know all there is to know about the life of fish ! ... You look like you 're beaming with pride as you walk around with that fine fish encyclopedia of yours !
$ENTITY How 's it going , ... You did n't ask me to come over here to scold me , $ENTITY did you ?
$ENTITY I 've prepared a little something to celebrate $ENTITY Groundhog Day $ENTITY . $ENTITY Would you like to see , maybe ?
$ENTITY You 've made me the happiest ... in town , $ENTITY Thanks a bunch . $ENTITY See you again next year !
$ENTITY Seeing the moon $ENTITY kinda makes me feel like I 'm going to transform into something mysterious . $ENTITY Aargh ... uggh ... Trans- $ENTITY tion ! ... Nah , I 'm only kidding ! $ENTITY I bet a lot of legends were formed after people looked at the moon and felt the same power I just did !
$ENTITY Why am I not surprised that this is what $ENTITY 's place looks like ?
$ENTITY I 've tagged along with $ENTITY on shopping trips before ... . She only buys things that are `` awesome ! '' $ENTITY I do n't really get what she means ... but I guess she would only hang an `` awesome '' picture ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY There 's less than an hour to go , but $ENTITY I 'm not mentally prepared for the new year yet ! $ENTITY I still need to figure out what my resolutions are !
$ENTITY Wow , $ENTITY look , $ENTITY ! And the color is perfect too , $ENTITY .

some consideration , I declare it to be ... Yes , without a doubt .
$ENTITY ? Seems you 've got your go-to accessory from now on . If you have a match coming up , $ENTITY let me know so I can go cheer for you ! ... !

$ENTITY How long ago $ENTITY do you think the stuff in here was painted ? $ENTITY I bet most of the stuff here is older than I am !

Called Napoleonfish , these fish also have the more accurate name of humphead wrasse . The true name comes from the distinctive humps on their heads . But `` Napoleonfish '' is more popular . When small , all Napoleonfish are females , but some become males as they age and their humps grow . Their bodies also turn a bluer shade as they mature and become males , making identification simple . Their bulky bodies , which can get to about six feet long , still glide easily through warm tropical seas . Finding these fish is a real treat for divers , as they 're stunning to see and it 's a great story to tell .

Horned herculeses are the largest beetles in the world , reaching over 17 cm in exceptional cases . Their 2 long horns look pretty , but they 're powerful and can hurt a lot if you 're pinched by them . The longer horn is covered with short , soft yellow hair , which helps them to sense vibrations . The yellow on their bodies turns black when it 's humid , making them difficult to spot on humid evenings .

$ENTITY If we had another person , ... we could almost play a 2-on-2 pickup ball game , ... ! $ENTITY Err ... well , $ENTITY never mind ... . Sports are n't really my thing ... .
ENTITY Of course , $ENTITY we now come to the problem . I can not ever hope to build a caf on my own . $ENTITY I 'm sure my friend would delight all of $ENTITY . I can vouch for his skills as a conjurer of coffee . But I ca n't say abracadabra and make this dream a reality . Hoo , what to do ...

$ENTITY But I 'll drop that for now , 'cause there 's more important stuff to worry about ! $ENTITY Like , $ENTITY who $ENTITY WAS that troublemaker ? $ENTITY I hope our paths do n't cross again . $ENTITY And in the meantime , ... I want $ENTITY YOU to start learning more about me ! $ENTITY Maybe it 'll come in handy someday .
$ENTITY It 's good to be all enthusiastic about today 's $ENTITY Bug-Off $ENTITY , but you also need to make sure you warm up ! There . I warned you . I ca n't be held responsible $ENTITY for what will happen if you do n't warm up , $ENTITY !

What kind of advice would be good for you right now ... Ah ! $ENTITY Come to think it ... .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY # x17 ;
$ENTITY Whoa ... What happened there ? $ENTITY Uh , yeah . $ENTITY Sorry . $ENTITY That was a little ... $ENTITY embarrassing . $ENTITY I guess I got in touch with my inner brat , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY It 's a letter from ... Even though it 's from someone who lives near me , it 's still always nice to get a letter ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I love that feeling right after the fireworks are over . $ENTITY It 's like a teakettle just taken off the heat ... Inside it 's still all bubbly !
$ENTITY For some reason , ... has always reminded me of you . $ENTITY Is it because you 're both smart and funny ? $ENTITY Nah . $ENTITY I think you both have the same shirt or something .
$ENTITY See , $ENTITY no matter what I do , I always get sleepy early at night . $ENTITY It makes me feel like such a baby ! $ENTITY Plus , being nocturnal is cool , right ?
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I take my coffee $ENTITY without any sugar ... It goes so much better with donuts that way !
$ENTITY Hey , look ! It 's the red hero ! $ENTITY What sort of enemy are you fighting today , red hero ? ... It seems like the red hero always ends up being the hot-headed leader of the hero squad ...
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY The rumors are true , I see ! $ENTITY You 're the proud owner of the finest $ENTITY I 've ever seen ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I mean , the contents are one thing , but just getting a letter from a friend makes me so happy ! Really makes me wan na show it to everyone I run into !

I wish I could swim like a fish ... . Just imagine how I 'd $ENTITY twirl in the water , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Have you caught any bugs yet ? $ENTITY I 've been swinging my net an awful lot , $ENTITY but I 've mostly been catching grass .
$ENTITY Sorry to pop in like this , but I was totally in the neighborhood $ENTITY and wanted to know $ENTITY what you 're up to !
$ENTITY The title is a bit quirky . $ENTITY It 's called The Perils of $ENTITY While $ENTITY
All right ... When you 've finished $ENTITY sorting out your feelings for me , $ENTITY I 'd like to be invited over someday .
$ENTITY So $ENTITY right now , $ENTITY I 'm trying to get rid of all the little empty spaces between my pieces of furniture . $ENTITY I mean , what if something happens and I get stuck in one of the gaps ! ... OK , that 's probably not gon na happen . $ENTITY But I am looking for cool , small furniture . $ENTITY If you know of anything like that , let me know about it , OK ? $ENTITY As long as it 's small , I really do n't care what kind of furniture it is ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Cough cough ! $ENTITY You 're ... , right ? $ENTITY I moved to this town ... because you asked me to ... But as soon as I came here , $ENTITY I caught a cold ... Cough cough ! $ENTITY Careful not to get sick as well ... It 'd probably be better if we sat down and chatted after I 'm better .
$ENTITY Did you see the shooting stars ? $ENTITY We 'd better figure out what to wish for , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Hmm ... Oh , $ENTITY I know ! ... I 'm gon na wish for an endless supply of $ENTITY !
Man , what a long trip ... I was on the train for 17 hours ! ... !
$ENTITY Anyway , I wonder what $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY is gon na give me this year ... I hope it 's a $ENTITY plant $ENTITY ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Santa ! $ENTITY Did you know that $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer is looking for you ? $ENTITY I guess it 's easy to get separated .

$ENTITY
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Really ? $ENTITY So it 's just me ...
$ENTITY I said he could take his time . $ENTITY I knew he 'd get it back to me !
$ENTITY I ca n't believe there 's not even ONE thing left ! $ENTITY This store is doing serious business !
$ENTITY A refrigerator ? $ENTITY Do n't worry I wo n't look inside . $ENTITY I 'm a bit of a neat freak , $ENTITY so if I saw some really old $ENTITY in there ... . ? $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY the horror !
$ENTITY What ? $ENTITY You somehow lost the lost item somewhere ? $ENTITY Hah ha ... if irony had a face , it 'd be yours !
$ENTITY I feel like treating myself to something special today . $ENTITY The only question is ... what do I get ?
$ENTITY Zzzzzzzzzz ...
$ENTITY The competition is fierce ! ... has caught the bug- catching fever , ... .
$ENTITY Hrrmmm . $ENTITY T- $ENTITY too expensive , huh ? ... Well , maybe I overshot the mark a bit . $ENTITY How about $ENTITY Bells ... OK . I 'm in . I said no .
$ENTITY Also ...

$ENTITY Santa ? $ENTITY I ca n't believe you 're here in ... But ... wait . $ENTITY Why would you be here now ? $ENTITY And where 's $ENTITY Jingle ... He 's not normally here until later . $ENTITY I 'm not quite sure what 's going on .
Hey , ... can I get a minute ? $ENTITY The truth is , $ENTITY I 've been thinking it 's about time for me to leave this place behind . $ENTITY It 's not that I 've started to hate $ENTITY or anything though ... . It 's actually pretty nice here ! $ENTITY That 's why I 'm thinking I got ta bust out of this lukewarm place and $ENTITY harden myself up again ! $ENTITY GRAH ! ...

$ENTITY Hey , hey ! $ENTITY I see you both made it here alive !

$ENTITY Congrats ! $ENTITY I knew your wish would come true ! $ENTITY You 're too good a person to not get your wishes granted , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY Did you know you can make wishes for every shooting star you see ? $ENTITY But you have to hurry , $ENTITY because they whiz past pretty quickly ... . , $ENTITY there goes another !
$ENTITY Do n't you ever want to experience a new place , ... Of course , I love everyone in this town , but ... On the $ENTITY of this month , I 'm venturing out into the world . $ENTITY Do n't go ! Good for you !
$ENTITY Everyone is scared of ghosts and things like that , $ENTITY but not me ! No , sir , I 'm not scared of anything ! $ENTITY It 's so nice being utterly fearless . Uh , $ENTITY just do n't go asking around about that fact , though ... .

$ENTITY Oh , hello , $ENTITY ! What 's going on , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Show me something you like ! It 's worth asking , though I might say no . But whatever !
$ENTITY This recycling system works out great 'cause sometimes the things you do n't want are the things I DO !
$ENTITY Wh- $ENTITY whoa there ! $ENTITY Look , just trust me . This is totally legit . $ENTITY You 'll take it , right ? $ENTITY I mean , we are friends , are n't we ? $ENTITY Sure we are . Something 's up .
$ENTITY Oooh ... your hat looks really nice today , ... ! $ENTITY

These fish are relatives of sea bass , though they 're preyed on by other , larger fish , such as black bass . Their defining features are their large , prickly dorsal fins and gray stripes on pale-yellow bodies . Ice fishing on frozen lakes is a very popular way to catch them in their native United States and Canada . They are often fried before being eaten , which makes them a simple but tasty meal .
$ENTITY Yeah , talking about the weather probably wo n't ruffle anyone 's feathers ... So I guess that 's a pretty good trick , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Aw , that 's easy . $ENTITY I 'd spend the whole day doing jumping jacks ! $ENTITY You could jump from one town $ENTITY to the next ! $ENTITY Of course , $ENTITY it would n't be easy to bring a friend along or anything . $ENTITY Unless they were in good shape too !

Flies are often seen rubbing their forelegs to clean them , which seems odd , because , well , they 're flies . However , they need to keep their legs clean as they contain taste and tactile receptors . By doing so , they can better savor the flavor of whatever they find to eat next . The legs also contain a sticky liquid so flies can more easily land on smooth surfaces .

$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY Now that you mention it , it is , like , totally clean in here ! $ENTITY Last time I was here , $ENTITY there were , like , leftovers and comic books all over the place ! $ENTITY At least now , your place is n't a fire hazard anymore . $ENTITY That 's real progress , ... .
$ENTITY Hm ... . Does n't really seem like something $ENTITY would be into ! $ENTITY Then again , $ENTITY it all makes TOTAL sense when you think about it ... . $ENTITY I do n't know how , but it has to !
$ENTITY Wait . You DID want something like that , $ENTITY right ? $ENTITY I swear you said you did ... Did n't you ? $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I must have confused things ... . But now you HAVE to take it , $ENTITY . $ENTITY

$ENTITY Today $ENTITY I 'm going for a look that shouts $ENTITY `` $ENTITY `` ! $ENTITY It matches how I feel inside .
Well , I guess I can leave this town with no regrets ...

And we 're gon na work on our friendship ! $ENTITY I can always move out and work on my own stuff later , ...
$ENTITY Well , I 'm sort of in a bind here ... . so I 'll sell it to you for all the Bells you have on you .
$ENTITY said she was really into reading fitness magazines ... There was the Sitting Workout mag and then the `` Build Muscle Using Your Sofa '' article ... Is she just not satisfied with her ... Why ca n't it just be for sitting like normal ?
$ENTITY Walloping water bottles ! $ENTITY That soon ? $ENTITY I do n't think even legs as buff as mine can get over there that quick . $ENTITY Ca n't we make it a little later ?
$ENTITY Oh , that reminds me ! I ran into $ENTITY Leif $ENTITY from the gardening store just a few minutes ago , wandering around ! $ENTITY `` My weed-pulling plan is perfect ! '' $ENTITY He just kept muttering that . $ENTITY I guess he 's pretty worked up about it ...
$ENTITY I see , $ENTITY so you were just waiting for something like this piece , huh ? $ENTITY Cool ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY Findin ' just the right bargain is somethin ' really special . $ENTITY It 's not for the faint of heart ... . $ENTITY Some of my customers are so dedicated that they come from far away to check out my stuff . $ENTITY Without the loyalists , true friends through and through , where would ol ' $ENTITY Redd $ENTITY be ? Penniless and broken !
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY ! Check it out !
$ENTITY So you think it 's lower than 5 ? $ENTITY Well , $ENTITY the number on the card is ... Heh heh . $ENTITY Off to a bad start ! $ENTITY Shake it off ! Shake it off ! $ENTITY Gather your wits and get ready ... .

... You might be good at it , but it 's not a sport , you know !
$ENTITY GAHAHA ! $ENTITY Sorry . My bad ! ... I thought you 'd scold me for `` not getting it '' or something like that !
My crew . Floored . By your ... Specific comments . Here we go . $ENTITY First ...

$ENTITY Without a sack of presents , $ENTITY you 're just a person in a Santa suit , $ENTITY are n't you ? $ENTITY If you were the real Santa , $ENTITY would n't you at least have some reindeer ?

$ENTITY My father $ENTITY and mother $ENTITY each had a father $ENTITY and mother . $ENTITY They each had their own father $ENTITY and mother $ENTITY with fathers and mothers $ENTITY of their own ... . $ENTITY That 's a long list of relatives !
Sounds like ... # x2 ; 0 reaction ? $ENTITY Shoulda been there ! I do n't remember .
$ENTITY Oh ! ... Actually , yeah , that 's totally mine ... . Thanks for picking it up for me ! $ENTITY By the way , $ENTITY that fragrance you 're smelling is my secret cologne ! $ENTITY Anyone who smells it is supposed to become my prisoner of love ...

$ENTITY So , what are your feelings on decorative plants ? $ENTITY I told $ENTITY a thousand times that he should get some bonsai trees in here ... He should n't have anything to do with fancy-schmancy plants like the $ENTITY there !
Oh ... Uh , no , ... it 's nothing ! ... The coffee just smells a bit different than I 'm used to , so it surprised me is all . Even if it 's blended , having different amounts of $ENTITY milk $ENTITY and $ENTITY sugar $ENTITY would change the flavor , or so I 'd assume . Well , I 'll see you later . Thank you !
$ENTITY The $ENTITY is so sneaky ! I ca n't catch one ! $ENTITY Could you get it for me ? $ENTITY OK , will do ! No , sorry .
$ENTITY Oh my ! $ENTITY Did I not give you $ENTITY an $ENTITY ogre mask $ENTITY yet ? $ENTITY Would you like a red one or a blue one ? $ENTITY Red one ! Blue one !

$ENTITY
$ENTITY Actually $ENTITY since this is a dream , you can just walk straight through walls ... . Bwahaha ! $ENTITY I 'm kidding ! $ENTITY There are some aspects of this dream that are just like reality ! ...
I 'm sure you know the big tree in our town center is special ... but have you ever sat in front of it ? $ENTITY You should try it sometime . $ENTITY I think you 'll find it evokes a powerful sort of nostalgia . $ENTITY It 's almost like the history of $ENTITY is playing out before your eyes ... .
$ENTITY Aw , do n't sweat it , man ! $ENTITY I can see by your determined look you 're doing pretty well ! $ENTITY Keep it up ! $ENTITY !

See ? $ENTITY Is n't that great news ? ! ... Do n't tell anyone about this , OK ? We 'll make it our little secret .
Things did n't go the way I planned , but at least you 're still surprised !

I have n't heard a peep out of $ENTITY 's house , $ENTITY but I know ... # x0 ; is n't sleeping right now . I 'm a little worried , ... .
People assume squids have legs , but those are actually arms . There are 10 in all ; two are used to grab prey . To swim , they twist their fins and expel water from inside their bodies to allow for fluid motion . The ink they shoot when threatened forms into the shape of a squid , acting as a sort of body double .
$ENTITY Please slow down a bit , ... I 'm disappointed in the way you escort people ! ... Let 's just forget about it ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , how about $ENTITY Bells ... ( Sure ! No .

$ENTITY So what do you use this $ENTITY for , ... ? $ENTITY If I had one of these , $ENTITY I 'd use it to weigh my food . $ENTITY I 've always wondered how much a mountain of cotton candy would weigh .
... Wait , $ENTITY `` adorable little guy '' ? ... I ai n't adorable , and I ai n't little , sister ! ... Watch it ! ...
Eels are born in the ocean but swim upstream through rivers when they become adults . They do , however , eventually swim back to the ocean when it is time to lay eggs . Their blood can be toxic , which is why you 've never heard of eel sashimi . It 's just too dangerous . Cooked eel , however , is edible and has no poisonous effects to speak of , making it a popular dish . For a long time , the egg-laying locations and habits of eels were largely a mystery . However , they are gradually being revealed through research , making eels a very hot topic of study .
$ENTITY Heh heh ... Thanks ! $ENTITY !
In what world could this possibly work itself out ? !
$ENTITY has said that $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY # x0 ; ... So the one who is n't ... is probably the impostor , right ?
I 'm redecorating my room , $ENTITY but ... I feel like there 's something missing ... . Could you bring me something to fill in an empty spot ? $ENTITY I 'm thinking ... something that 's a bit on the long side ? ... I 'm sure you 'll be able to find something really great .

The spotted pattern on cherry salmon serves as camouflage and is rather common in all salmon . Most cherry salmon spend their lives in rivers , but some do migrate to the ocean to fully mature .

Migratory locusts are large insects that can jump up to 32 feet , as they open their wings when they jump . These locusts love to eat and can consume their own weight in food every single day . As a group , their hunger is enough that a million locusts can consume one ton of food per day . Oddly , when migratory locusts grow up surrounded only by other locusts , their shells will be entirely black .
Snails are mollusks that live on land and are related to shellfish like clams and oysters . One snail can play the role of both a male and a female , so it can lay eggs all by itself . Newly hatched snails already have a tiny shell , so right from birth they are easily identified . Most species have clockwise spirals on their shells , though spirals that go counterclockwise are possible .

Whale sharks are the world 's largest fish , but they 're surprisingly some of the gentlest . They can swim at only three mph , so although they 're large and very imposing , they 're not really a threat . They swim with their mouths open to swallow vast quantities of tiny creatures and seawater . As they expel the water through their gills , they will eat what then remains . Since they do n't have to bite prey , their teeth are file-like and number about 10,000 in multiple rows .
Oh dear ... . I do hate to tell you this , but ... Mmmmm ... images , video , audio , and text data $ENTITY restricted by their guardians can not dream ... OK. ... For Guardians .

Blowfish are considered a delicacy , famous for their tempting taste despite being highly poisonous . Blowfish are not poisonous at birth , though , which makes young ones relatively safe for consumption . It 's only once they have ingested enough microbes from seawater and food that they become poisonous . When they feel threatened , they suck in air and water to blow themselves up like balloons . This makes them too big to eat without predators being forced to chomp down on their poison quills .
I got the $ENTITY & # x1F ; $ENTITY badge ! It 's proof I 've caught a ton of bugs !

Gobble ! $ENTITY Anyway , to thank you for helping me , $ENTITY I 'd really like you to have this $ENTITY !

Before you do anything else , you should head to the $ENTITY town hall $ENTITY !
LOOK ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY There 's a person in this town named $ENTITY # x0 ; ... thing or if ... # x0 ; was forced into it by some odd circumstances or something ... . $ENTITY I actually think it 's pretty cool , all things considered !
Hey , wait a second ... Are n't you ... Remember me ? $ENTITY I 'm $ENTITY ! $ENTITY When I was camping here before , ... invited me to move here . $ENTITY But it looks like this cold moved with me ... . Once I 'm better , we should totally hang out , ... .
$ENTITY Every year I look out the window $ENTITY and think about what the new year will be like . $ENTITY Let 's hope it 's amazing !
$ENTITY The thing about the convenience store is I find myself here every day even if I do n't need anything ! $ENTITY And since it 's open late , it 's perfect for a night owl like me ! I love it ! ...
$ENTITY Whoa ! $ENTITY A 5-minute run ? $ENTITY That 's pretty close ... . But it 'd probably be a half-hour crawl , right ? So I guess that 's actually pretty far , ... .
$ENTITY You 're late , ... We were all waiting for you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY the ogre has come !
Oh ... Uh , no , ... it 's nothing ! ... I was expecting my usual coffee and was surprised is all . Even though it has milk , I guess the flavor changes when the amount of $ENTITY sugar $ENTITY or type of $ENTITY bean $ENTITY is different . Well , I 'll see you later . Thank you !
I guess I got here too late . $ENTITY Everything 's sold out !
$ENTITY Crunches are such a common type of exercise ! Everyone can do them ! $ENTITY Take me , for instance ! I 'm flexing my abs right now ! $ENTITY Although , the downside of crunches is sometimes you feel a little bit of rumble in the ol ' tummy ...
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY I 've been waitin ' for ya !
$ENTITY I forgot my original reason for wanting to move , but I did say I was going to move at one point , did n't I ? $ENTITY This is kind of embarrassing , but $ENTITY told me not to go , so I changed my mind ... . Basically , $ENTITY needs me around . $ENTITY So you 're not getting rid of me just yet !
$ENTITY Morning , ... Today 's the $ENTITY Summer Solstice $ENTITY , so I made myself get up early . $ENTITY I wan na squeeze as much action as I can out of all this daylight ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY You know , back home my place was always the main hangout for folks ... So I 'm used to having lots of peeps around . I would n't even mind it if a few more were here !

Ocean sunfish are a relative of blowfish that can reach up to two tons in weight . Lacking a tail fin , they can not swim particularly quickly , which is an odd bit of anatomical detriment . The number of eggs they can lay is the most in the world at over 300 million . However , out of that 300 million , only one or two fish will ultimately survive . Ocean sunfish sometimes like to bob up and down on the surface of the ocean . This gives them the appearance they 're sunbathing , which helps to make them a popular breed of fish .

$ENTITY Hooray ! ... Jack $ENTITY would be pleased if I gave this to him . $ENTITY But this piece is all mine !
$ENTITY It 's been a nice $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY and all . But I 'm kinda surprised $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY did n't make a main dish ! Unless ... he DID make a main dish and I never got a bite of it ! $ENTITY But that would never happen ...
$ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY , I heard you needed to talk to me . $ENTITY That right ? ... You got somethin ' to say , ... ?

Do you get along well with $ENTITY I , well ... I would n't say we 're close ... . If we run into each other , $ENTITY we have decent enough conversations .
$ENTITY Wearing the same clothes day after day can get pretty boring , yeah ?
$ENTITY I do n't think there 's another museum around that can match our collection here in $ENTITY . $ENTITY I always wanted to live in a town with a world-class art scene ... . !
Fishing is a form of meditation for me . So peaceful ...

$ENTITY I should give you something , of course ... .
$ENTITY Thanks for the $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY , ... Down the hatch !

$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY She 's young , but look at her go ! $ENTITY She has such athletic fingers ! ... Yup , that 's some skill right there !
I wish I could huddle under an umbrella with someone , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY are you out watering the plants today , ... As long as you live here , ... the flowers and other plants in $ENTITY will be in good hands , ... !
$ENTITY Hurray ! $ENTITY It 's my old pal , capsule ! It 's so good to see you again ! $ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY Why is it empty ? $ENTITY Wait a second . $ENTITY Was this your doing , $ENTITY ? $ENTITY Aw , man ! $ENTITY How could you do this to my poor time capsule ? $ENTITY Not cool !

$ENTITY While I 'm here , I should probably check out all the other rooms too ! $ENTITY !
All right then ... This wraps up just about everything we 'll need to process your move ... . The last thing we 'd like you to participate in is a ceremony that commemorates your arrival . $ENTITY Can you take a look at the map on the Touch Screen ?
$ENTITY We probably just misunderstood each other . $ENTITY I 'll apologize too !
$ENTITY Great ! ... It 's yours then !
$ENTITY No way ! $ENTITY Seriously ? ! $ENTITY Man , I had n't even thought of that ... You 're on ! I 'll move to ... Us meeting like this has got ta be a sign ... It 'll be fun to be neighbors with you again ! $ENTITY See you there , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I like knowing the things I do n't use anymore will end up in homes where they ARE used !
$ENTITY Aha ! $ENTITY You 're the smarty-pants liar !
$ENTITY So $ENTITY what do ya want ? $ENTITY You dragged me over here for something .
$ENTITY One cup of coffee to go , with $ENTITY lots $ENTITY of milk , yes , yes !

$ENTITY So you want to be called $ENTITY `` $ENTITY `` ? $ENTITY That 's right ! No , that 's not it .
$ENTITY When I was a kid , $ENTITY there was a girl in my neighborhood who 'd cry when she saw empty cicada shells . $ENTITY I thought it 'd be fun , so I gathered up a lot of those shells and told her they were a present . $ENTITY Boy , did she cry ! ... I guess I could n't keep myself from teasing the girl I liked . $ENTITY That 's just how it went . ... Probably was n't very nice , though .

These are aquarium fish that came about by selectively breeding types of crucian carp . It took hundreds of years to get the long tail fin and beautiful color of the current breed .

$ENTITY Got ta love the whizbang of these fireworks ! $ENTITY It gets us festival goers all hyped up , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY She was happy I returned it ? $ENTITY I ca n't even begin to tell you what a relief that is . $ENTITY If anyone 's going to hold a grudge about returning something late , it 's $ENTITY , $ENTITY !

$ENTITY This is your one chance this year to enjoy the autumn moon , $ENTITY so do n't miss out , ... . $ENTITY Other holidays may be celebrated year round ... like my birthday , $ENTITY for example .
$ENTITY Your stress level is on the rise . $ENTITY A long walk or some singing may help you blow off steam . $ENTITY
Will you stick with those socks ? $ENTITY Yep , I 'm good ! No , I 'll change 'em .
I made cookies , $ENTITY but there are n't enough for everyone . $ENTITY I hope that does n't make me a bad host .

$ENTITY Me daughter keeps bringin ' me seaweed sculpture ... I do n't get it . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I love New Year 's , but my parents inevitably sent me another huge batch of carrots . $ENTITY They just keep watching the news every night and get fed the same old carrot agenda , which is sad . $ENTITY Rabbits need more than carrots ! ... Everyone assumes otherwise , but it 's the truth ! ... Oh well . $ENTITY Food 's food .
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Hey , ... Out here on the job in this meh weather ? You must be working pretty hard ! Hey , but do n't push yourself . You should try to finish up before it really starts to rain ... . !

$ENTITY My musical roots are founded firmly in both $ENTITY and ... . Oh , but I 've been influenced by a few books as well . It 's all part of the whole $ENTITY package ... . $ENTITY I often read my favorite book right before a music concert starts . I must 've read it $ENTITY times at least . $ENTITY What 's it titled ? You do n't say .
$ENTITY The key to flowers is giving them lots of food , $ENTITY water , $ENTITY and love . $ENTITY Then they grow to be big and beautiful !
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY we rang in the new year without a single problem , ... !
$ENTITY Grrrrr ... Fine ! $ENTITY In that case , we 'll have $ENTITY here tell us who has ... the scarier face !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Jellyfish ? Er ... . Uh ... . Really ? $ENTITY Because that sounds totally delicious , $ENTITY !
Sorry to dump this on you ... . You 're a real stand-up $ENTITY l for helping me ! $ENTITY !
ENTITY Whew ... I 'm beat ! $ENTITY Even though it 's kinda cold out , I still worked up a sweat cooking for the festival ... . $ENTITY But we got through all courses of the meal ! $ENTITY I 'll bet everyone is quite satisfied with the results !
... =
$ENTITY Hmmmm ... Well , would you look at the $ENTITY . $ENTITY Pretty stylish , right ? $ENTITY They say learning an instrument will bring in the dough ... . I think someone 's been giving me really bad advice ... . GAHAHA !

$ENTITY Oh ... $ENTITY I know I 've been saying I should cut back on spending , but ...
$ENTITY Ha ! I actually ca n't move just yet ... . I 'm not ready to up and leave my buds in my own town , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Hey ! $ENTITY I just had a brainstorm ! ... You wan na come over to my house right now ? $ENTITY See ...

Ca n't right now ...
$ENTITY I saw this report on TV about how $ENTITY fishing is good for you ... Apparently `` staying active '' is important . $ENTITY But you know what else is good for your health ? $ENTITY Sharing your fish with your friends ! ... That last part was n't in the report , $ENTITY but I think it 's still true . $ENTITY Which brings me to my main point ... Would you catch a $ENTITY river fish $ENTITY for me , ... Any kind would be just fine ! $ENTITY No problem ! I ca n't .
$ENTITY I ca n't believe she gave me something like this ... Must be her grown-up sensibility in action .
This time , each of you will need to bring me ... of each of the fruit treasures assigned to you . $ENTITY For $ENTITY # x0 ; $ENTITY , ... and $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Oh , do n't worry about that . $ENTITY Half of the time , people make fun of all my trendsetting , ...
$ENTITY Oh , so I brought you something ! ... Just a little $ENTITY for you to munch on if you want .
$ENTITY You should maybe ... try to sharpen your intuition a bit more .
$ENTITY Suit up ... I like it ! $ENTITY It 's truly the sophisticated man 's battle armor ! $ENTITY If both $ENTITY and I were to get in suits , $ENTITY I wonder which of us would look more like the boss ...
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I think if you want to have a great day , $ENTITY just ask for one and $ENTITY you 'll totally get it , $ENTITY . $ENTITY Here goes , ... Hey , world ! ... Gim me a great day ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Today 's all about $ENTITY cleaning up the town ! ... I 'm sure you 're gon na pull a ton of weeds . $ENTITY So I 'm gon na $ENTITY research a nice way to $ENTITY cook them up !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY I really wan na use this wrestling mat sometime ! $ENTITY It would be all $ENTITY `` $ENTITY Rumble $ENTITY in $ENTITY 's room ! ''
'll get right on it ! $ENTITY The cancellation should go into effect by tomorrow morning . $ENTITY By the way , $ENTITY there 's no extra fee for dropping an ordinance , as it 's built in to the original ordinance fee .
$ENTITY So we 're all done here , right ? $ENTITY Thanks a bunch for coming to get me , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY All right , I 'm gon na take off . $ENTITY I have , $ENTITY like , a whole bunch of new outfits $ENTITY I need to go try on . $ENTITY See ya !
Ugh ... A mosquito bit me ! $ENTITY It snuck up on me and then $ENTITY bzzzt ! ... Crafty little buggers , are n't they ? $ENTITY But I ca n't say it 's all bad . $ENTITY The itch is so summery , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I was hoping you can hunt down a $ENTITY stag beetle $ENTITY for me . Any kind would be totally fine , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Those letters in your mailbox $ENTITY are delivered by a dude named $ENTITY Pete ... I bet he has to get up super early . $ENTITY Sounds rough , ... !
Just between you and me , ... how does $ENTITY compare to your town ? $ENTITY It 's cleaner . It 's dirtier . It 's exquisite ! It 's smaller . They 're the same .
$ENTITY Excuse me , $ENTITY but I should be going ... . I 'll see you both around town , $ENTITY !
However , $ENTITY if you do not own anything that sounds like that , $ENTITY you need n't worry . I , $ENTITY Katrina $ENTITY , have prepared some special goods $ENTITY filled with my power for good fortune ... . As long as you wear one , both good and bad luck will be as you wish ... And as it happens , $ENTITY the stars have declared that you , yes , you ... are worthy of owning such a thing .
... Just saying the name gives me a thrill . $ENTITY Maybe I 'll become a resident ? $ENTITY Yeah , live here ! Do n't be too hasty !
$ENTITY If you 've got some extra space in your house , $ENTITY you should use it to store gyroids , ... ! $ENTITY They make all sorts of crazy noises $ENTITY and do all these weird dances , ... !
$ENTITY What 's going on here ? !
my . I 'm dreadfully sorry ... The $ENTITY access point $ENTITY you 're connected to does n't seem to be working well . $ENTITY Please wait a moment and then try again . Thank you !
$ENTITY This has been the most successful $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY ever , ... I mean , what 's better than a belly full of mouthwatering food ?
$ENTITY
Oarfish are deep-sea-dwelling fish with long , thin , silver bodies and one red fin lining their backs . They can reach lengths of over 10 yards , making them huge and striking fish . They usually swim by twisting their long , thin bodies , but they can also swim in more vertical positions . Their mouths are small compared to their bodies and they have no teeth , so they 're large but not imposing .
$ENTITY The last fireworks of the summer were so pretty ! $ENTITY All shiny and stuff ! $ENTITY !
Have you seen Mayor $ENTITY 's $ENTITY house yet ? $ENTITY Thing 's huge ! $ENTITY It 's got ta be two stories tall !
$ENTITY I 've heard hunger is the best sauce . $ENTITY And I sure hope that 's true , $ENTITY because my food wo n't be ready for , like , 30 hours .
$ENTITY Moderately clean underwear !
$ENTITY Well ? $ENTITY What are you still doing here ? $ENTITY You got my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY now please get that horrible thing out of here !
$ENTITY Happy New Year ! $ENTITY It 's only the first day of the year , and I 'm already tired . I stayed up too late last night . $ENTITY Maybe I 'll start $ENTITY off the right way $ENTITY with a nice , $ENTITY big nap . $ENTITY !
, residents ! $ENTITY The $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY has begun ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Ah ! That reminds me ! $ENTITY Brewster ... When I leave , can I have three bags of coffee beans to go ?
$ENTITY Oh , that is wonderful ! This makes my day complete , ... ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Ah , ah ... I- $ENTITY I 'm sorry ... It wo n't stop ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Less talk , $ENTITY more snooping !
Good morning to you , sprout . $ENTITY Did you come to get yourself a cup of morning coffee ?
ENTITY The first is $ENTITY ordinances ... By enacting ordinances , you can change the way $ENTITY is run . $ENTITY Of course , you ca n't just enact any old ordinance you feel like enacting . $ENTITY That would make you a dictator ! Instead , you 're able to choose an ordinance out of a list provided to you . Try to choose ordinances that match up with the lifestyles and needs of $ENTITY 's residents .
$ENTITY There 's some really interesting furniture in here , $ENTITY !
He who wishes to grow big would be wise to eat his roughage . ( # 21 )
$ENTITY So we 'll meet at my place at ... , right ? $ENTITY I 'll be chilling out at home waiting for you , ... .
$ENTITY Huh ? $ENTITY Did you forget ? ... I wanted you to find a large piece of furniture that fits in with my room ...
$ENTITY Hmm ... I guess that means I 'll have to investigate your family too now ! $ENTITY Let me know the next time you 're making a trip home , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY ? ! ... Nice ! $ENTITY I love stuff like this ! $ENTITY Man ... you really get me , do n't ya ? $ENTITY You 're making me blush !
$ENTITY Here 's an idea ! $ENTITY We should have $ENTITY festival $ENTITY to celebrate $ENTITY ! $ENTITY That day $ENTITY everyone would eat for free at the $ENTITY shop , ... .
$ENTITY Heh heh heh . $ENTITY I know why you came to visit our town today ... You came to look for gossip about the mayor of ... right ? $ENTITY ? $ENTITY , huh ... I have n't heard any real scandalous gossip lately ... . Hey , instead , $ENTITY why do n't you just interview me ? ... I promise I wo n't disappoint ! I 'm all about scandals !
$ENTITY If a baby goat is called a `` kid , '' why is n't an older goat just called a `` man '' ? Maaan , that 'd make sense ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , let 's see ... There is a $ENTITY resident 's home $ENTITY so close on the other side ! $ENTITY I think placing a bridge here might cause problems ... .
$ENTITY That seems like something that will come in handy someday . $ENTITY So keep it safe , OK ?
$ENTITY You 're gon na do some moon gazing tonight , right ? $ENTITY Autumn Moon $ENTITY is when we take some time to appreciate that big , muscular moon up there ! $ENTITY It 's kinda funny to think that people all over the world work out under the same moon , ...
contents ...
$ENTITY Avast , $ENTITY ! I 'm considerin ' holdin ' ya in me brig till ya say somethin ' nice about ...
$ENTITY No ! $ENTITY You opened it ? $ENTITY But at least that went unnoticed , ... That might seem like a small thing to you , but it 's a huge breach of etiquette to me !
$ENTITY If our first meeting is in a dream , $ENTITY this must be a sign of something good , ... .
$ENTITY I 'm glad you agreed ! $ENTITY Then let 's play $ENTITY Made Ya Look ...
$ENTITY Eek ! $ENTITY You found me ! $ENTITY I thought I 'd be safe here , $ENTITY but you saw right through my plan !
$ENTITY Yay , $ENTITY I 've got my hat on as well ! $ENTITY When the clock strikes midnight , $ENTITY I 'm going to make a wish . $ENTITY It 's my own little $ENTITY Countdown $ENTITY tradition !
$ENTITY Yar , in all me years o ' rowin ' 'round the seas , I never be runnin ' into a true member o ' the merfolk . $ENTITY Aye , people be tellin ' me I need to look harrrrder , ... but why is it me own fault that merfolk be hatin ' me ? ! Yar ! THEY be the snooty ones ! $ENTITY Merfolk ? $ENTITY More like mersnobs ! $ENTITY They can be keepin ' their distance !
$ENTITY
... will you be traveling to another town ? $ENTITY Or would you like to invite friends to ... I want to travel . Invite friends over . Neither .
$ENTITY I got a present from Santa himself ! ... How special is that ? $ENTITY Really special ! $ENTITY I 'm so glad I stayed up for it !
$ENTITY Huff ... huff ... If I never get over this illness ... please take care of all the flowers in $ENTITY for me ... .
$ENTITY Whoa , Santa ! ... I heard that $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY the reindeer was looking for you just a bit ago . Why 's that ?
$ENTITY Wow ! $ENTITY You 're amazing ! ... You got all the signatures for my petition , $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Now my dream is one step closer to becoming a reality ! And I 've got something for you too .
What I like best about $ENTITY Brewster ... is that he does n't get too friendly , $ENTITY even if you 're a regular ! $ENTITY That makes it easy to enjoy a long , relaxing time all by yourself ! $ENTITY Sometimes I just need my space !
Call me crazy , but I just do n't know what to think about $ENTITY and $ENTITY . $ENTITY It 's , like , sometimes they 're total besties . $ENTITY But other times I get the feeling they do n't like each other . $ENTITY Friendships can be complicated , I guess . $ENTITY Maybe they just need time to get to know each other better .
$ENTITY Well , I guess we 'll never be the very best of friends then , will we ? ... I never flatter my real friends .
Careful on your way out .
$ENTITY never really talks about cooking for herself , does she ? $ENTITY Maybe having such a nice $ENTITY is enough to satisfy her needs ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I hope this is the first time of many for these interior-design parties at your place !
, the $ENTITY here will be used in your house remodel scheduled for tomorrow . $ENTITY The remodel should be done by tomorrow morning , so look forward to it , yes , yes !
$ENTITY It makes me so happy that the sender took the time to write me ! $ENTITY Anyone nice enough to write me a letter like this $ENTITY is someone I want to be friends with , ... !
$ENTITY Happy $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , ... Trick or treat ! What 's up ?
ENTITY You 've got a pretty good eye ! $ENTITY And I was so confident in my disguise skills too ...
$ENTITY I should be more like $ENTITY and keep my place company-ready at all times !
$ENTITY I almost forgot !
$ENTITY You know this is n't my place , right ? ... OK then ! $ENTITY We 're Oscar Mike !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY a new friend ! I am SO glad we 're meeting today . $ENTITY See , $ENTITY when I moved to town , ... I did n't know anyone . $ENTITY I did n't even have enough friends to host $ENTITY - eating party . $ENTITY So , $ENTITY I always go out of my way to introduce myself to the new folks in $ENTITY . On that note ... Hello , $ENTITY I 'm $ENTITY . $ENTITY Good to meet you , ... .
$ENTITY A huh huh huh ! $ENTITY Pretty sweet layout I 've got here , huh ?
$ENTITY You 're acting kind of obsessed with me . $ENTITY Which is totally understandable , ... . $ENTITY Just take a deep breath , $ENTITY and tell me what you need .
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY right ! $ENTITY You reminded me to get my hat out , ... It just does n't feel like the countdown has started if you 're not wearing one of these !
$ENTITY I wanted something to REPLACE my ... I do n't need another one !
$ENTITY It just stays bright forever ! $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Huh ? ! $ENTITY You opened the present ? ... Blarg ! I ca n't give it to $ENTITY like this ! ... Man , $ENTITY asking you to do this for me was really foolish on my part !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Ah , $ENTITY nice to meet you . $ENTITY You must be related to $ENTITY , right ? $ENTITY You two look awfully alike . ... What ? $ENTITY It IS you , ... Oh ! $ENTITY That 's why I thought you looked familiar ! $ENTITY Long time no see ! $ENTITY I 'm glad you came back ... . Let 's plan on hanging out a lot to make up for lost time !
$ENTITY When I was a kid , $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY was the only thing on my mind all during the month of December ... But these days I 'm too darn busy ! $ENTITY It 's no good ! $ENTITY I want to be a kid again ! ...
Oh , $ENTITY so $ENTITY has n't tried it on yet ... ? $ENTITY I 'm sure it 'll probably look great , though !
$ENTITY Take good care of it , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Welcome , welcome ! $ENTITY Enjoy your stay , ... !
$ENTITY To be honest , $ENTITY I 'm disappointed with this year 's $ENTITY Harvest Festival $ENTITY . $ENTITY There just was n't enough food . $ENTITY Franklin $ENTITY , $ENTITY you had one job !
$ENTITY Oh no , $ENTITY I 'm sorry if I frightened you ! $ENTITY You should talk to $ENTITY Jack $ENTITY too . $ENTITY Then we can have fun together !
$ENTITY Wow ! I 'm so lucky to find this item so cheap ! $ENTITY At least , that 's my first impression . $ENTITY But to be honest , I just want it because it 's a bargain ! $ENTITY It 's actually not something I would normally like ... . .
$ENTITY Um , $ENTITY I 've got a lot on my mind right now ... So maybe we should talk later .
In ... the mayor has n't set any ordinances , ... The reason ? $ENTITY I 'd have to ask the mayor to find out the exact reason and all , but ... It 's probably because the mayor is busy with video games or some such ! ... I 'd be the same way .
$ENTITY Happy New Year , ... May all your hopes and dreams for the new year come true !
$ENTITY Today $ENTITY I just want to show my appreciation for everyone who works so hard here in $ENTITY !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Yo , ... You 're quite the girl magnet these days , are n't you ? $ENTITY You 're not exactly cut and chiseled , ... so you must be a real charmer !

$ENTITY Whoa , what time IS it ? Pretty late for you , is n't it , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Do n't forget to deliver the present to $ENTITY , OK ?
$ENTITY Heh heh . $ENTITY sure likes girly wrapping , does n't she ? ... Not $ENTITY that I 'd know about girly wrapping !
$ENTITY Hey ! Your ... You 're getting a happy-item bonus ! A $ENTITY happy-item bonus ! ... Bugs ? Not usually worth many points . $ENTITY But a seasonal bug ? A ... ? $ENTITY That 's different ! Very specific . And wonderful . Worth a happy-item bonus ! Extra points for you ! $ENTITY Keep it around . $ENTITY . You can get your bonus every time ! Bang !

$ENTITY Did you open this ? ! $ENTITY Why did you do that ? $ENTITY I spent ages making it all nice and neat . Now I got ta do it all over again ... .
$ENTITY So $ENTITY gave me a great tip about how I can be a superstar someday , $ENTITY . I need to remind the future me how much star power I have , just in case I forget , $ENTITY ! I 've put a $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY together that should do the trick . $ENTITY Could you bury it for me ? $ENTITY Sure , I 'll help ! No , sorry .
$ENTITY BRRRR ! ! ... How in the world did I fall asleep out here ? $ENTITY It 's , $ENTITY freezing !
$ENTITY I wonder how I 'll do in the next tournament . It 's never too early to start practicing again !
That face tells me ... that you 're in fine form , $ENTITY ! Do n't go changin ' , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY My clothes look $ENTITY , do n't they ? $ENTITY I hear that a man who can pull off this look will be popular with the ladies ! $ENTITY !

$ENTITY I guess $ENTITY 's been observing things reaaally well , $ENTITY huh ?
$ENTITY They have such a great selection here , $ENTITY I can never make up my mind .
$ENTITY I 've heard that a supermarket is like a battlefield , $ENTITY but it does n't seem to be the case in here ...
$ENTITY That was quite a shock ! $ENTITY It 's just a feeling , but $ENTITY I ca n't help thinking once every visitor 's gone home , it 'll happen all over again ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hmm ... Cruisin ' around all cool at night $ENTITY or feeling the morning sun shining on my back ... Aw , man ! $ENTITY I ca n't decide what I want ! ...
$ENTITY

$ENTITY Oh yeah , that reminds me ... I thought I 'd let you have my $ENTITY ! $ENTITY Go on . $ENTITY You like gifts , do n't you ?
$ENTITY So whaddya say , ... Howzabout striking up a deal with your ol ' best buddy ? $ENTITY How much ? Who are you again ?

Zebra turkeyfish have long , beautiful fins that flow like gowns as they swim through the sea . However , these aquatic beauties pack a punch , as their fins are filled with poisonous spikes .

Cyclommatus stags are identified by their long pairs of mandibles , which can be as long as their bodies . Their large mandibles are actually already formed when they 're in the pupal stage of life .

There 's less than an hour left until the new year ... Do n't count on me acting like those doofs outside ! They 're getting all carried away for nothing !

'' $ENTITY I was happy to hear that , $ENTITY so I began dancing around ! ... Then I said to her , $ENTITY `` Tell me more , please ! '' ... And she said , $ENTITY `` Shrunk , $ENTITY I can see that NO ONE laughs at your jokes ... $ENTITY `` Still , $ENTITY you go on stage every day , Shrunk ! ... It is so DARING to be as unfunny as you are ! '' ... Can you believe it ? ... THAT made me the most daring comic in the biz ? ... YEAH , RIGHT ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Well , look what the cat dragged in ... It 's you , $ENTITY , and at such a late hour !

$ENTITY Oh ? How strange to run into you so very late , $ENTITY ! Then again , it 's been a strange day here . The sun never came up , $ENTITY and so it never set either . $ENTITY It 's thrown my internal clock ALL out of whack .
$ENTITY
$ENTITY `` The longest day of the year . '' $ENTITY When I was a kid , $ENTITY hearing that would really get me fired up ! ...

$ENTITY You have quite a few things on the floor ... . You must be too busy to clean up , huh ? $ENTITY If it 's OK with you , I could come over again sometime and help you organize , ... !
$ENTITY
You $ENTITY wo n't forget to get ready for $ENTITY Halloween $ENTITY , right ? ... Sounds like there 's a type of headwear that 'd be best to snag ahead of time .

It 's not really all that confusing ! $ENTITY If you see some headwear in $ENTITY Labelle $ENTITY 's shop that 's priced at $ENTITY 1,031 $ENTITY Bells ... do n't pass it up !
I 'm not into this rain , $ENTITY . It makes us soggy . $ENTITY Not a good look for ANY of us , $ENTITY .
$ENTITY Do you know what a $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY is , ... It 's kind of like a message for your future self . Here 's how it works ... . You put some stuff $ENTITY or a letter $ENTITY in a capsule . $ENTITY Then you bury the capsule in the ground . $ENTITY After some time has passed , $ENTITY you dig up the capsule and collect your loot ! $ENTITY Coincidentally , $ENTITY I just made a time capsule myself . $ENTITY But now I 'm too wiped out to do any digging . ... would you do me a huge favor and bury my $ENTITY time capsule $ENTITY someplace in town ? $ENTITY Sure . I ca n't .

Giant isopods are related to pill bugs , and they can grow up to 20 inches long . They are scary looking but still come across as humorous for some odd reason .

Get it ? $ENTITY Taste ! $ENTITY It 's ... it 's because it looks like a fruit . You get my clever joke , right ? My cleverness was n't lost ?
$ENTITY This is weird , but ...

And I feel great ! $ENTITY I 'm not normally a follow-the-rules kinda gal , but this is OK so far ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY When I was taking a walk yesterday , $ENTITY I found this thing ... Is n't it yours ?

$ENTITY

$ENTITY I 'm doing a VERY important survey about current trends in town , and $ENTITY I wanted to get your input ! $ENTITY What do you think are the hottest styles in $ENTITY ? Anything from clothes $ENTITY to makeup $ENTITY to hobbies !

$ENTITY When ye offer a ferry service ... ye got ta be ready to leave whenever yer customers want ! $ENTITY That be why I drink a lot of bean brew so I do n't be gettin ' sleepy . $ENTITY But sometimes I get too much caffeine in me system and get what we call the sea jitters ...

Styracosaurus literally means `` spiked lizard . '' It looked roughly like a more intense triceratops . In addition to the spike on its nose , it had three sets of horns extending from its gaudy neck frill . Fossils have generally been found in groups , so the belief is that it was a herd animal .
$ENTITY It 's nothing fancy , $ENTITY but I hope you enjoy your visit !
$ENTITY Great ! $ENTITY Now , just saying hello will make me sound sophisticated . $ENTITY I ca n't thank you enough , ... !
$ENTITY The $ENTITY makes me feel like the times are changing really fast ! $ENTITY I suppose $ENTITY is an early adopter of new technology ... Well , nothing wrong with that ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY I should totally take a lesson from ... and clean up my place with $ENTITY !
$ENTITY I bet that 's where $ENTITY likes to sit and give herself a mani-pedi ! $ENTITY Such a comfy little salon !
$ENTITY What for ? $ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY A live venue ! $ENTITY Collecting enough signatures for a club sounds difficult . $ENTITY But it 's a great idea , $ENTITY so I 'll definitely sign !
$ENTITY Nope , $ENTITY that could n't be anyone BUT you . $ENTITY No one really swings a net as smoothly as you , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Pack a lunch , $ENTITY she says ...
$ENTITY Fishing is a battle with the fish , $ENTITY and it 's also a good chance to be open with yourself and nature ! $ENTITY Speaking of which , $ENTITY someone once gave me some solid advice . $ENTITY They told me that if you want to enjoy your life , $ENTITY you should learn how to fish , ... !

$ENTITY Looks like the guys just ca n't help followin ' ye around , ...
$ENTITY No ! $ENTITY You did n't TRULY open it , did you , ... Every tiny detail was supposed to be absolutely perfect to smooth things over !
$ENTITY It really hurts that you keep pushing me around like that ! $ENTITY If you need me for something , $ENTITY use your words ! $ENTITY You do n't have to shove me ! $ENTITY

You ca n't remember a thing ? ... Well , I guess you 're just as forgetful as I am then !
$ENTITY Can you believe it ? ! $ENTITY Mr. $ENTITY Lyle $ENTITY really wo n't tell me a single thing about what he saw there ! I wish I could have gone ... It makes you realize just how much clout the $ENTITY HHA $ENTITY has ...

$ENTITY When you examine a work of art , $ENTITY it 's important to consider the period in which it was created . $ENTITY It can help you figure out what the artist $ENTITY was trying to say .
$ENTITY I 've got a big problem , $ENTITY . I 'm hungry for $ENTITY fruit $ENTITY , but I do n't want people to see me shake a tree ! Can you go find me ... I 'm on it ! Nope .
You can greatly change the taste of soup with $ENTITY fish $ENTITY in it by simply adding something to temper the flavor . $ENTITY Perhaps something like the sweet , $ENTITY citrusy flavor of some types of fruit would work ... I 'm obsessed with it ! $ENTITY That citrusy smell ... . It 's a lifesaver ... . $ENTITY That 's right ! $ENTITY If you add a bit of $ENTITY lemon $ENTITY , the fishy smell is obliterated . $ENTITY This makes it easier to eat .
$ENTITY It 's such a lovely season , $ENTITY is n't it ? $ENTITY The stars look so crisp in the cold air ! $ENTITY All the better for $ENTITY Jingle $ENTITY to visit !
$ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY I 'm sorry ! $ENTITY I was staring at your clothes just now ! $ENTITY Gracie $ENTITY 's design looks amazing $ENTITY no matter how many times I see it , ... .

$ENTITY I was headed to a country that 's so full of life it 's hard to comprehend ! $ENTITY There are live mariachi bands that perform such fun , lively music it makes you dance , $ENTITY even in the heat ! $ENTITY Sure , $ENTITY we assume there 's a lot of desert , $ENTITY but it 's just like any other warm , dry place of the world ... . $ENTITY And , $ENTITY # xE ; $ENTITY the FOOD ! $ENTITY It can give a seagull a stomachache if he 's not careful ! $ENTITY And I rarely am ! $ENTITY The trouble is I never know how to eat in moderation , $ENTITY so I always overeat ! ...

$ENTITY When I drink coffee , $ENTITY I only like just $ENTITY a little bit $ENTITY of milk in it . Otherwise the flavor 's gone , ... ! $ENTITY Enjoying a mild coffee flavor $ENTITY is the real $ENTITY style !
... Does n't look like it 's been used much , $ENTITY !
Let 's make this interesting . $ENTITY If you can catch , $ENTITY say , ... or more $ENTITY fish , $ENTITY I 'll give you some medals .
$ENTITY I knew you could n't resist ! ... Hooray and hooroo ! ... Well then ... let 's decide it by playing $ENTITY Made Ya Look ...
$ENTITY Is this your top speed ? $ENTITY If I were all by myself , I would have been there by now , ...
$ENTITY
Huh ? $ENTITY It seems like someone 's locked it from the inside ... $ENTITY
Yeah ... Maybe I should go shopping again . $ENTITY I ca n't look like a freak when I 'm working out ! $ENTITY , you can buy clothes too , $ENTITY if you want to . $ENTITY Just head to $ENTITY Able Sisters $ENTITY on Main Street . It 's kinda cool , ... They sell tons of stuff ! $ENTITY It makes me happy just thinking about it ! $ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY Yeah , I should also tell you ... Tees $ENTITY are shirts with short sleeves , and $ENTITY tanks $ENTITY do n't have any sleeves . $ENTITY Remember that !
$ENTITY Whaat ? ! $ENTITY ? ! $ENTITY You 're everywhere , ... !
Here you go ! ... And my signature was the very last one you needed ! $ENTITY Now you can submit this , right ? $ENTITY Very nice !
$ENTITY Arrrk ark ark ! $ENTITY It seems you 've gotten pretty good at diving for things in the sea ... . It makes this old man happy to know you 're enjoying yourself so contentedly with nature !
$ENTITY But for lunch yesterday , $ENTITY I layered fresh tomato sauce and extra-fine mozzarella over some flat bread .
$ENTITY Wait ! Did you LOSE the package ? $ENTITY Oh , now it 's far worse ! What will $ENTITY think of me now ?
... is just sitting here covered in dust !
$ENTITY Awww ! $ENTITY That 's it ? Really ? $ENTITY I 'll never make it ... I do n't have the self-control for that , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY If people will pay a penny for your thoughts , but you give them for two cents , someone 's getting ripped off . $ENTITY
$ENTITY I thought I 'd never get it back , so I already bought a new one !
$ENTITY Hey ! How about you try on a new look too ? Yeah , take this ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Welcome to my lair ! $ENTITY Hahaha ! $ENTITY !
$ENTITY Girl chat , you say ? $ENTITY That sounds like fun . $ENTITY How do we $ENTITY `` girl chat '' ?
ENTITY Oh dear ... It looks like it spit out an error message of some sort ... . Let 's see what the problem is ... .
$ENTITY Coming here to watch the fish swim around helps me relax .
$ENTITY Yep . $ENTITY That looks lovely ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Today it does n't matter what you wear , $ENTITY as long as it 's green . At least $ENTITY that 's what my mom always says !
ENTITY Ah ! Hey ! $ENTITY Why did you change your clothes ? You know , the festive suit ? You got ta wear the whole thing ! This is a real job here , so you need to take it seriously ... That makes me an annoyed little reindeer ...
Oh , OK. $ENTITY Well , I hope you come visit some other time .
$ENTITY Hee hee hee ! ... Nights like tonight make me want to throw away all the umbrellas in town ... . $ENTITY and make everyone $ENTITY tap-dance in the rain with me , ... !
ENTITY My hobby is giving badges to all the good boys and girls like you ... . Why , I 'm $ENTITY Phineas $ENTITY , the badge man ! $ENTITY I can tell what you 've done $ENTITY and how good you 've been ... All of that from just one look ! $ENTITY So how about you then ? Allow me to take a look ...
$ENTITY Oh ! ... Here visiting , huh ? $ENTITY Do n't you just love the rain ? I hope it rains tomorrow too , $ENTITY .
Value the friends you have , for one day you may need them . ( # 33 )
$ENTITY I 'd say it all worked out well for us both ! $ENTITY Lucky indeed , ... !
$ENTITY Well , I think that about wraps things up for me , ... make sure $ENTITY pays you for your trouble !
$ENTITY Here ! ... Candy ... Take it ! $ENTITY
... You got a lotta nerve ! $ENTITY There 's only one thing the real $ENTITY says when someone asks what her favorite phrase is ! $ENTITY
$ENTITY Hey , $ENTITY look who just stepped off the train ...
A promise is a promise ... OK , $ENTITY here 's a piece of my $ENTITY candy $ENTITY .
I put stickers all over my face , $ENTITY and it made my face really itchy ... Listen to me , ... Putting stickers on your face is a really bad idea , ... .
$ENTITY Well , $ENTITY that came down to the wire , $ENTITY but I guess you found what you wanted ... . !
$ENTITY Anything else ? $ENTITY Can I have my results ? Theme challenge ! Can I have my prize ? I do n't need anything .
$ENTITY I 'm wishing my hardest that each and every one of us stays happy and healthy throughout this next year !
$ENTITY Your house is , like , totally perfect for parties ! $ENTITY Super spacious , so there 's room for a dance floor too ! Ooh ! $ENTITY Promise me if you ever throw a dance party , you 'll invite me ! Pinky swear , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You 're the best , Santa ! You made $ENTITY Toy Day $ENTITY perfect ! I hope you get all your work done tonight !
$ENTITY Heh heh heh . $ENTITY I wonder if $ENTITY actually chose all the furniture in his room by himself ... $ENTITY I mean , I suppose it 'd be weird if he let someone else do it .
It 's been said that I 'm rather harsh on the ladies , but it 's only because I expect so much from them ! If I do n't tell them they 're being unfashionable , who will ? $ENTITY I 'm doing them a favor , honey !
That 's ... not a great time . $ENTITY Ca n't you pick something a little earlier , $ENTITY ?
$ENTITY Thanks ! $ENTITY I feel a little better ! $ENTITY I 'm keeping my fingers crossed ...
$ENTITY Well played . $ENTITY Actually , you did get pretty lucky . $ENTITY .
$ENTITY You 've come visiting so late , $ENTITY and on such a snowy night ! Stay warm , $ENTITY , $ENTITY OK ?
$ENTITY Well . $ENTITY . $ENTITY . Your home . Interesting stuff . Good work ! $ENTITY The Happy Home Academy has a name for your style . Pack Style . Very low key . Setting up big things . $ENTITY My crew ? Very excited . Expecting your home to be a breakout hit !
$ENTITY
$ENTITY Wow ... This is from $ENTITY ? $ENTITY ? This is unexpected ! $ENTITY I 'm kinda happy and freaked out at the same time ... But it 's not so bad !
$ENTITY is probably a bit too big ... , do n't you think ? Or maybe $ENTITY he just likes to curl himself $ENTITY into a teensy-tiny ball when he sleeps , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY You 're a lifesaver , ... That $ENTITY medicine $ENTITY made me feel a little better . $ENTITY But if I know anything about colds , it 's that they can stick around ! I hope I 'll be all cured by tomorrow .
$ENTITY Oh ! $ENTITY That 's right . $ENTITY It 's $ENTITY Festivale ... I thought things seemed a little different outside .
Is n't this rain ever going to end , $ENTITY ? I 'm so drenched !
When you 're cooking $ENTITY fish ... adding something sour can really brighten the flavor . $ENTITY Like ... lemon ... or $ENTITY vinegar $ENTITY ! $ENTITY I 'm never sure which one to pick ... . $ENTITY Guess it depends on your own personal taste , $ENTITY !
$ENTITY If you and $ENTITY decide to have a snack , $ENTITY promise me you 'll include me too !
$ENTITY Here you go . $ENTITY I look forward to hearing you 've collected all the signatures you need !
, only that ... it seems we might be having visitors soon . $ENTITY Maybe , maybe not . $ENTITY Oh , $ENTITY what I mean is , $ENTITY since the station gate is open , $ENTITY someone might visit . $ENTITY That 's all ...
$ENTITY I hope you enjoy celebrating $ENTITY Girl 's Day $ENTITY in $ENTITY before leaving .
$ENTITY
ENTITY Also , do n't overlook our personal exhibit rooms and museum gift shop on the second floor !
My $ENTITY mom $ENTITY and $ENTITY big brother $ENTITY are n't anywhere in this town ... They are n't as big as my dad , but both of them are bigger snowpeople than me .
