BO FreeF 0229 Someone told me February 29th<6> only comes around once every 4 years on leap day. <53>So where does it go for the other 3 years?<6> Does it just take a super-long nap or something?
BO FreeF 0229 <87>February 29th is a special day that only comes around once every 4 years!<6> It's called leap day! <18>Don't worry, though.<6> There's no actual exercise involved.
BO FreeF 0229 I thought it was the first day of March,<8> but since this year is a leap year,<8> it's actually still February! <141>It's like I got a free day<8> to do whatever I want!
BO FreeF 0229 <87>March starts today!<15> So that means spring is right around the corner!<6> Yessssssss! <121>Huh?!<15> What do you mean it's still February?!<619> Oh, right. It's leap day!<15> Ugh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> What a letdown.
