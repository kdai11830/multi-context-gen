FU Sp Recycleshop <36>Aw, rats.<6> There's nothing here,<8> and I was hoping to find the perfect used item for my house.
FU Sp Recycleshop <28>Not a single thing here?<6> I must have just missed a big sale.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Wow, nothing left in the whole shop!<6> Did someone win the lottery and go on a shopping spree?
FU Sp Recycleshop <28>Only one thing left?<619><13> It's yours if you want it,<8> <70>.<6> I already have something like it at home.
FU Sp Recycleshop Oh,<8> the last item in stock.<6><214> Do you think I should buy it so it doesn't feel lonely?
FU Sp Recycleshop <31>Knowing this is the last one here makes me want to buy it!<619><16> Unless<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Is that just a sales tactic?
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>It'd be nice if they had more in stock,<8> don't you think?
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>I'm just browsing for bargains!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>One time<8> I found the perfect lantern here.
FU Sp Recycleshop <53><97>With so much to choose from,<8><13> I just can't make up my mind!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>I'm happy to see they have so many items to choose from.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>I can't decide what to get.<6><214> That's what happens when you go shopping without something specific in mind.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Are you hoping to buy something, or are you selling?<6> Either way,<8> good luck!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>I always bring in what I don't need anymore.<6> That way someone else can use it!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Did you bring in something to sell?<619> <23>Oh!<6><214> I should sell my extra <54> at home!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>I like knowing the things I don't use anymore will end up in homes where they ARE used!
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>I feel like I got a solid deal today!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>There are quite a few things I'm interested in,<8> but it's important to stick to a budget.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Has anything caught your eye yet?<619> Take your time!<6> It's only worth it to buy the things you love.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>I'll be saving up my play money for the next great item to turn up here!
FU Sp Recycleshop <214><41><77><834>!<6> Why do I get the feeling this item was once yours,<8> <70>? <8>.<8>.<8>.<6>Maybe I should make a purchase.<796><1099> Buy my stuff! Don't!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Is this your <834> here on sale?<619> It's very nice.<6> In fact,<8> I might buy it<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><796><1099> Buy it! No, don't!
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Oh!<6> I was just admiring your old <834>.<619> Actually,<8> I think I might buy it.<796><1099> Yes, do! No, don't!
FU Sp Recycleshop <31>Oh,<8> I'm sorry.<6> I didn't realize you already had a buyer for it.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>You know what?<6> I will buy it!
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>Well,<8> since you loved it so much,<8> I'm sure I will too.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Excuse me.<6> I'd like to buy this.
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><72>Oh,<8> actually,<6><13> since you're here, I can just pay you directly.
FU Sp Recycleshop I'm considering buying your old <834>.<30><18>I'd like to,<8><8> but it's a bit more than I wanted to spend.<6><28> Maybe I should wait and save up<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><796><1099> Buy now! Save your Bells.
FU Sp Recycleshop Aww.<6> I wish I had more cash on me.<16> Buying your <834> would take every Bell in my pocket. And if I spend that much,<8> I can't go grocery shopping until tomorrow.<15> Still<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><796><1099> Who needs food? You should wait.
FU Sp Recycleshop <53>It's a shame this isn't a little less expensive.<6><13> I think I'd like to buy it.<796><1099> Buy it anyway! Take your time.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>You're right.<6> If I really want it,<8> I'll come back to buy it later.
FU Sp Recycleshop <53>Thanks for the advice,<8> but it's just more than I can spend right now.
FU Sp Recycleshop <561>I'm afraid I just can't spend this much money when I'm not sure.
FU Sp Recycleshop <212>Th-<8>this is too much!<6> I'm afraid I simply can't afford it.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>You're right.<8> It's not that much more.<6> I'll take it!
FU Sp Recycleshop <53>It is a lot of money, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>OK.<6> I'll take it.
FU Sp Recycleshop <13>Do you really think so?<619> <40>I have to admit<8> the thought of owning this is exciting. OK.<6> Consider it sold!
FU Sp Recycleshop <72>Wow!<6> It's much cheaper than I was expecting.<619> <28>Are you sure you want to sell it at this price? <13>It's certainly tempting to buy it<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><796><1099> Buy it! Don't buy it.
FU Sp Recycleshop <26>What?<6> O-<8>OK.<619> <13>It did seem too good to be true.
FU Sp Recycleshop <38>O-<8>oh.<6> That's OK.<6> Now that I think about it,<8> I have something like it at home anyway.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>You're right!<6> I can't pass up an opportunity like this.
FU Sp Recycleshop <26>Wh<8>-what?!<6> I didn't realize <77> <834> was worth so much.
FU Sp Recycleshop <26><41><77><834> for <375><863> Bells<375>?!<30><38>I suppose new ones cost twice that,<8> but I can't buy anything so extravagant.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>I love the <834>.<8> And I don't normally make impulse purchases, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<796><1099> Buy buy buy! Don't do it!
FU Sp Recycleshop <26>You think?<6> Maybe I'll pass on it.
FU Sp Recycleshop <214>So you think it's a good deal too.<6> Then I'll buy it!
FU Sp Recycleshop <87>Wow!<6> What a great price!<6> I'd better buy it before someone else does.<796><1099> Do it! I wouldn't...
FU Sp Recycleshop <28>Oh?<6> Maybe you're right.<15><13> I was just browsing anyway.
FU Sp Recycleshop <31>You're right,<8> of course. <6>I was too easily swayed by how cheap it is.
FU Sp Recycleshop <40>Yeah!<6> It's too good a deal to pass up.
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>I never thought I'd find one at this price!<6> <40>Talk about a great deal!
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>What a bargain!<6><40> I'll be coming back soon to look for more deals.
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Thanks partly to you,<8> I got a great deal on something I love!
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Secondhand stores are so much fun!
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><87>I love a successful shopping trip.
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><214>I can't wait to get this home and try it out!
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Since I splurged on this,<8> I'll have to be careful to save Bells later.
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Even though it was expensive,<8> I won't regret buying this at all!
FU Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>I feel good about this decision.<6> I'm glad I bought it!
