FU Dt Club <219>I was a little apprehensive about coming to a show like this.<6><13> But now that I'm here,<8> I'm feeling great! <87>Listening to music at a concert is much more fun than just playing a recording.
FU Dt Club <31>I get so excited that I get nervous!<6> It's like being on the first big hill of a roller coaster.<16>
FU Dt Club <141>Music like this speaks to my soul!
FU Dt Club <26>Gah!<15><16> No matter how often I come here,<8> the beat still seems really loud sometimes!
FU Dt Club <87>Are you getting into the swing of things?<6> The groove? The beat?<6> I am!
FU Dt Club <214>Dancing here helps me to blow off some steam and get some exercise!
FU Dt Club <214>I feel so rejuvenated!<6> Dancing here really helps to clear my mind.
FU Dt Club <13>I wish I was more musical!<6> I'd love to create music that makes people want to dance.
