NPC Howto 2 <26>Ah, <6><214>hello there!<680> I just delivered some mail to you!
NPC Howto 2 I already put it in your <375>mailbox<375>, <214>so be sure to check it later.
NPC Howto 2 When your mailbox is full, I can't cram any more in there, so<214> don't forget to collect your mail, OK? <16>When you have mail,<1172> you'll see a blinking sign like you see now. That's how you'll know! Well, I've gotta get moving!<619> <616>I'll see you later!
NPC Howto 2 When your mailbox is full, I can't make any more deliveries, so be sure to take out the letters, OK? See? <6>You can tell your mailbox is completely full at the moment, so please empty it as soon as possible! Well, that's all for now. I've gotta get moving!<619> <616>See ya later!
NPC Howto 2 When you want to send a letter, just visit the <375>post office <375>over in the shopping district. I'm just the delivery guy, so I can't take any of your mail directly. It's just how the rules work, I guess.
NPC Howto 2 You can buy <375>stationery<375> for writing letters from the <375>shop<375> in the shopping district! If people don't write letters, we'll go out of business<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <214>So I hope you write lots of letters!
NPC Howto 2 <16>By the way, letters aren't just for sending messages. You can use them to send presents too. <214>It doesn't cost you a thing, so I'd be quite happy to send something along if you ever need it done!
NPC Howto 2 <1172><26> Ahhh! <6><214>Hello there, Mayor! <680>I've got a delivery for you!
