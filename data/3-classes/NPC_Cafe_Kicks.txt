NPC Cafe Kicks I really love a good cup of coffee<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><214>I have to say, though,<1172> the <375>mocha <375>here beats all other types by far!
NPC Cafe Kicks Now, I'm not saying that lattes are bad,<670> but when I'm here, I prefer to drink my coffee black. You know, <375>without<375> milk.
NPC Cafe Kicks I like to come here after work and wind down with a cup of coffee that's got just <375>1 spoon<375> of sugar<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><214>It helps perk me up after a long day.<1172> Motivates me to work hard the next day too.

NPC Cafe Kicks Hmm? <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670>Ah, <1172>if it ain't the young <22022><1002>i<22023><22024>#x0;!<619> <214>Thanks for taking a moment to say hello!
NPC Cafe Kicks Ah!<1172> The young <22022><1002>i<22023><22024>#x0;!<619> How's the day treatin' ya?
NPC Cafe Kicks Oh,<670> I'm pretty sure we've met here before, haven't we?
NPC Cafe Kicks <214>Hullo!<6> I had a feeling I'd run into you here today!
NPC Cafe Kicks Well, what do ya know?<6> Strange how often I run into you when I come here! <214>Seems we both get the urge for coffee 'round the same time!
NPC Cafe Kicks Hullo!<6> I was just thinking I'm in the mood for bit of a chin-wag with someone!<30><214>Why not join me for a mo' if you've got the time?
NPC Cafe Kicks The harder I work at my shop, the more delicious my cup of coffee at the end of the day tastes. It makes me feel like I gotta do my best the next day too, so I can drink another cup of delicious coffee! If you ever need socks or shoes,<1172> you should stop by my shop!<30><214>You're more than welcome to come by just to browse too!
NPC Cafe Kicks Before I opened up my own shop, I was a shoeshine in a city far away from here. <53>At that time, most of my customers were visitors coming to see the sights and little else. It made it hard to make any proper chums<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><16>One of the things I like best about my shop here in <107> is the closer bond with my customers.
NPC Cafe Kicks I reckon people would call this an occupational hazard, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>even when I'm just relaxing at times like this, I still find myself looking at people's feet. .<1172>.<1172>.<1172><26> Ah!<6> <16>It's not odd. I just get curious about what shoes they're wearing is all.<3600>
NPC Cafe Kicks So even if it doesn't seem like I'm looking at your feet<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><44>I'm still probably making sure to check them out!
NPC Cafe Kicks <22>In particular, I've long been curious about what kind of shoes <375>Brewster <375>wears all day long<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><53>Sitting at the counter like this,<1172> you really can't see anything because of the angle. Of course, that just makes me even more curious.
NPC Cafe Kicks <2><260>I don't<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><0><22><4><22> Er, forget I said anything<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Cafe Kicks Sadly, it's raining outside right now, but it's not all bad drinking coffee while listening to the raindrops.
NPC Cafe Kicks Nothing warms the soul quite like drinking a cup of hot coffee while watching the falling snow outside.
NPC Cafe Kicks It can be fun to watch the petals swirl outside, but it's also nice to quietly enjoy a cup of coffee. You can even enjoy both if you drink your coffee while watching the petals through the window.
NPC Cafe Kicks Even though it's spring,<1172> it can still get awfully chilly at night.<30>I can't think of anything better than warming up with a cup of coffee before making my way home!
NPC Cafe Kicks It's hard to resist the call of iced coffee when it's hot and humid every day like it has been recently<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. Still, I prefer my coffee extra hot.
NPC Cafe Kicks <53>I feel like it's easiest to appreciate the fine flavors of coffee on long fall nights like this<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16>People say fall is for reading or fall is for healthy appetites, but I think fall is for warm coffee indoors too.
NPC Cafe Kicks Drinking coffee on a cold night like tonight really warms you all the way to the core, doesn't it?
NPC Cafe Kicks <2><260>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><0><22><4><22>I'm sorry I don't have<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. any iced coffee to serve you.

NPC Cafe Kicks I heard from <375>Brewster <375>that we've got you to thank for there being a caf in <107>. "Public works project" sounds so harsh and official,<1172> so I was a little surprised by the caf at first<8>.<8>.<8>. <214>Now that I've started coming here, drinking coffee with everyone and relaxing... I realized something. <16>The greatest public works projects are the ones that bring a smile to the faces of the town residents! <214>Thanks for making a caf for us all to enjoy, <22488>
NPC Cafe Kicks <2><260>.<8>.<8>.<8><0><22>Thank you very much, coo.
NPC Cafe Kicks I heard from <375>Brewster<375> that the mayor built this caf as a public works project or some such. "Public works project" sounds so dull and official,<1172> so I was a little surprised at first<8>.<8>.<8>. <214>Now that I've started coming here, drinking coffee with everyone and relaxing, I realized something. <16>The greatest public works projects are the ones that bring a smile to the faces of all the town residents! I'm really glad I decided to open up my shop here in <107>.
NPC Cafe Kicks <2><260>...<0><22><4><22>I'm also happy<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. to have been able to open a caf in this town, coo<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cafe Kicks Oh<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. that reminds me, <4><22> <375>Brewster<375>!<619> I want to buy some coffee beans to use at home. Can you get some ready for me?
NPC Cafe Kicks ...<0><22>Of course.<6> Is your usual half pound still coo?
NPC Cafe Kicks <4>Certainly!<670> Thanks!
NPC Cafe Kicks Ah<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. that reminds me, <4><22> <375>Brewster<375>!<619> I've got to work on a few things when I get home<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. Can I get a cup of coffee to take away before I leave?
NPC Cafe Kicks ...<0><22>Of course.<6> Is your usual all right?
NPC Cafe Kicks <4>Certainly!<670> A <375>mocha<375> with <375>1 spoon<375> of sugar, please!
