Everybody's happy.<30>Chance to earn some bonus points without having to spend anything! What's not to like? Bang!
NPC Honma Commentary <18>So. <3407>. <439>. Let's talk themes. Ever think about themes? You should think about themes. <13>Uniformity. Congruity. Harmony. Matchiness. Bang. Good things. Change your score. Change your life! <16>My crew? They love interior-design themes. Formally recognize eight of 'em. Hold still while I rattle 'em off. <53>We got Harmonious, Rustic, Antique, Trendy, Fairy Tale, Sci-Fi, Quirky, and Toy Shop. Yep. Eight. Bang! <18>Course, one or two items a theme does not make. Don't bust <375>Lyle<375>'s substantial chops. Be serious! <13>Think you're up for it? Think you've got the interior-design know-how? Ol' <375>Lyle<375> admires your confidence!
NPC Honma Commentary <18>Stuff on the floor? No good. Stuff like fishing rods, shovels, etc.? You gotta be neater than that. Furniture facing the wrong way? No bang.

We're talking next-level tips here! <18>My team? They're partial to hard- to-find items. And refurbished pieces. That'll get you more points! <13>Word to the wise.
