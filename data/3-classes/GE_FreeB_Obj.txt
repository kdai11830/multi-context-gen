GE FreeB Obj <214>Just between you and me<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> One day, I'm gonna sit on the town's <814>... <25>and just wait for a passing talent agent to snatch me up! <319>That's how all the big stars are discovered!
GE FreeB Obj <214>I should totally stand next to our town's <814> and wait until someone says to me: <669>"Five minutes to curtain, Ms. <963>!" And then I'll be all like, <319>"Don't rush me! I'm a star!"
GE FreeB Obj <87>If you're going to have a fight with someone, you should do it under the town's <814>. <25>That way, it'll look like something out of a movie! <319>Lights, camera, and drama! Hahaha!
GE FreeB Obj <214>No more wandering around in the dark, thanks to our town's super- helpful <814>! <87>I could totally, like, hang out there all day and all night!
GE FreeB Obj <28><41><77><814>, huh? I wonder what that sign is trying to tell me!<619> <354>I wish it could talk!
GE FreeB Obj <87>Yay! Every time I see <107>'s <814>, I think there's a party going on! <103>So fun!
GE FreeB Obj Our town's <649><814> would be the perfect place to air one of my concerts! <87>Everyone in town would love it!<619> <44>Note to self: make this happen!
GE FreeB Obj <649>Did you know if you ring the town's <814> and say your crush's name three times... <367>you'll be madly in love for, like, the rest of your lives?<8> <18>True story.<619> Or not. <619><354>I just made it up.
GE FreeB Obj The more I look at our town's <814>, the more I think it was modeled after me! <367>It's practically like looking in a mirror! The artist really captured my inner glow, <42>!
GE FreeB Obj <87>That <814> would make the perfect audience member!<30><103>I could sing for it all day, and it'd never fall asleep!<619><7> Unlike some other audience members I know...
GE FreeB Obj <53>I've always wondered what that <814> is picking up and sending out to the world. <31>Wouldn't it be, like, totally weird if someone out there was watching your every move? <121>Creeeeeeeepy!
GE FreeB Obj <13>How I'd love to lie down on that <814> and soak up the sun... But too much sun causes wrinkles, and <77><46> must always take care of herself, <42>.
GE FreeB Obj One time, I spun around on our town's <814> so much, I got sick to my stomach. <561>But you mustn't blame the poor <814>! <36>To be fair, I was on it for, like, 3 hours.
GE FreeB Obj <87>You know, sometimes I climb up on the town's <814> and practice singing my solos! <18>There are, like, awesome acoustics up there! <40>La la la la la!
GE FreeB Obj <44>Our town's <814> and I look good together, don't you think? <13>I'm not surprised. <25>Not a day goes by when someone doesn't mistake me for a goddess of the desert!
GE FreeB Obj <13>I saw <704> hanging out by the town's <814> the other day. <41><2519>s<1001>#x0; waited for hours... <36>But no one ever showed up. I wonder what that was all about.
GE FreeB Obj <13>I love taking a deep breath next to the town's <814>. <141>So pretty, and it smells good too! <40>Aromatherapy is, like, the best, <42>.
