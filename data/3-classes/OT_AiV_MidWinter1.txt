OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Welcome to <107>. I hope you weren't planning on seeing anything, <70>. It'll be dark ALL day. <36>The sun's too lazy to get up today.<2289> It does this EVERY year on the <375>Winter Solstice<375>, <42>.
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Good morning. <6>Yes, <1172>I said morning. You'd never know, would you? Because it's still pitch black out! <36>Why the sun doesn't bother to rise this day every year is beyond me.<6> <13>Well, don't walk into anything, OK?
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Well done, coming all this way to <107> so early in the morning, <439>. <36>I'm sorry to say the sun isn't going to light up our lovely town for you. Why? <1172>It's just like that today.
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Visiting <107> today? How nice for us! I wish someone would have told the sun you're coming. <128>Then maybe it would have shown up today! I can't WAIT to give it a piece of my mind tomorrow.
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Good day,<8> <439>.<2289> That is,<8> if you can call THIS "good" or "day."<30><7>The <375>Winter Solstice <375>always keeps the sky dark from dawn to dusk.<6><13> Well, <8>try to have a good day, <8>OK?
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13><41><613>Hi there,<8> <439><614>. Welcome to our lovely town where the sun didn't bother to rise today. <36>Sorry. Can you tell the <375>Winter Solstice <375>bugs me? If I had to get up today, <1172>why didn't the sun?
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Good evening, <8><439>. Glad you made it to <107> in time for the longest <1172>night <1172>ever. We didn't really have morning, <1172>well,<1172> this morning. But it's always this way on the <375>Winter Solstice<375>.
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>Oh, how lovely to see you here in <107>. <6><36>At least there's been ONE bright light in my whole day! We didn't get a single ray of sunshine today. <13>Except for you, <439>. So, <1172>well, <1172>thanks.
OT AiV MidWinter1 Welcome to <107><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><6> <36>Where the sun never rises,<8> so the nights are twice as long! <354>Oh, <8>I'm sorry. <6>I just get like this on the <375>Winter Solstice<375>. Everything will be back to normal tomorrow.
OT AiV MidWinter1 <13>What brings you way out here to <107> so late at night,<8> <439>? <28>Did you realize it's been night FOREVER today? What a relief the <375>Winter Solstice <375>is almost over!
OT AiV MidWinter1 <28>Oh? How strange to run into you so very late, <439>! Then again, it's been a strange day here. The sun never came up, <1172>and so it never set either. <31>It's thrown my internal clock ALL out of whack.
