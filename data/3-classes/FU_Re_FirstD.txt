FU Re FirstD <72>Oh,<8> <70>,<8> it's so good to see you!<6><13> I was worried you'd moved away before I had even unpacked. <38>Since you recommended that I move here,<8> that would have been a little strange. <13>But you're here,<8> and I'm here,<8> so I hope we can be friends.
FU Re FirstD <87>Well,<8> here I am!<6> I'm all unpacked and ready to make new friends.<6><13> Thanks again for encouraging me to move.

FU Re FirstD <13>Hello!<6> I don't believe we've met yet.<6> My name is <963>,<8> and I moved to town not that long ago.

FU Re FirstD <679>Cough. Sniffle.<6> Oh,<8> excuse me.<6> We haven't met yet.<6> I'm <963>.<6> I just recently moved to <470>. <638><15>My friend <802> suggested I move here.<6> It's a great place to live!<6> I just tired myself out by packing. And now I've caught a cold because of it.<6><13> That's OK.<8> I'll be better soon.<6> I hope we can chat more later!

FU Re FirstD I can't remember where I put anything!<6> Which box is which?<30><16>Sorry.<6> Just had to get that out of my system.<6><13> I'm new in town,<8> as you can see. Someone local recommended that I move here,<8> but we haven't spoken since.<6> I guess I'm your new neighbor! I need to get this place cleaned up,<8> but afterwards,<8> I'd love to get a visit from you.
FU Re FirstD <72>Do you live here?<16><13> I just recently moved to <470>.<6> My name is <963>. One of your neighbors,<8> who has since left town,<8> thought I might like living here.<6> So far I really do! Anyway, I love making new friends,<8> so I hope we can chat again soon.

FU Re FirstD <72>We haven't met yet,<8> have we?<16><6><13> I'm <963>.<6> I moved to <470> not too long ago. Actually,<8> someone who used to live here thought I'd like it.<6> New stores,<8> new neighbors<8>.<8>.<8>. It's pretty great! Anyway,<8> I can't wait to get to know you better!
FU Re FirstD <616>Greetings!<6> I've been here for a little while,<8> but I don't think we've met yet.<6> My name is <963>. One of the locals,<8> who has since moved,<8> suggested that I live here, and I thought it was a great idea. So here I am!<6> I hope it's not too early to say this,<8> but I really think we might become good friends.
FU Re FirstD <13>We've never met before,<8> have we?<6> My name is <963>.<6> I'm pleased to meet you. Someone originally from this town suggested I move here.<6> It was a great suggestion,<8> for sure! Everyone here is so nice.<6> I've been here more than two weeks and I haven't met anyone mean at all.
FU Re FirstD <679>Blaaaaah.<15> Oh,<8> excuse me.<6> I've just caught a cold.<619><13> I don't believe we've met before.<6> I'm <963>. I moved here not that long ago.<6> It was a suggestion made by someone who used to live here. I'm really glad to be here,<8> though.<6><638><15> Even if I am sick.<6> I hope when I get better we can play together!
FU Re FirstD <13>Oh,<8> I don't believe we've ever met.<6> I'm <963>.<6> I just moved here not too long a-<8><638><97>ago.<6> Sorry,<8> I picked up a cold during my move.<6><13> But I'm really enjoying the town so far! Someone who used to live here spoke highly of the place.<6> That's why I moved,<8> actually. Anyway,<8> I hope when I get better we can see more of each other.<6><6><214> I love making new friends.<15><638>
FU Re FirstD <214>Hi, <439>!<6> Remember me?<6> It's <963>.<13><6> I moved to town after <802> suggested it to me. I was planning on heading to your house to say hello,<8> but it looks like you beat me to it. <214>It's so good to see you again!<6> We're going to make great neighbors.
FU Re FirstD <13>Hello!<6> It's so good to see you again!<6> <87>Starting today,<8> I can call myself a resident of <470>! <13><41><802> suggested I move here, and I thought it was a great idea.<6> So, here I am!<6> Just need to unpack. But I'll see you around town,<8> right?<6> I'm excited about us being neighbors.

FU Re FirstD <13>Are you surprised to see me?<6> I've actually just moved to town!<6> It was <802>'s idea that I move. <214>I'd heard great things about living here,<8> and I can see they're all true. I'll be seeing you around,<8> neighbor!

Someone in town suggested that I move here.<6> You know <802>,<8> right?<6> We're friends. I'm really hoping that you and I will also become better friends now that I live here!
FU Re FirstD <13>Oh,<8> I haven't seen you in a while!<6> Can you believe I live in <470> now?<6> <41><802> suggested it. <38>Oh right,<8> in case you've forgotten,<8> my name is <963>.<6><18> I'm looking forward to being your neighbor.
FU Re FirstD <214>Long time no see!<6> Remember me, <963>?<6> Hee hee.<6> Just kidding. But I am living here in town now! <13>I talked with <802> when I was camping here.<6> We got along so well that I decided to move! I hope you and I get to spend more time together now that we're neighbors.
FU Re FirstD <13>Finally,<8> a chance to say hello!<6> It's <963>.<6> We haven't seen each other in a while,<8> but I live here now! I was encouraged to move here by <802>.<6> But I was also happy at the thought of seeing you again. I think you and I could be good friends someday.<6> Hopefully one day soon!
FU Re FirstD <679>Sniffle.<6> Ugh,<8> this cold<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <13>Oh!<6> It's good to see you,<8> <42>!<6> Do you remember me?<6> It's <963>. I moved to <470> not too long ago.<6> <41><18><802> convinced me to move,<8> actually. <638><15>Excuse me,<8> I should get some sleep.<6> <13> But I can't wait to spend more time together once I'm better.
FU Re FirstD <638><15>Excuse me,<8> I've had this cold<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><72> Oh!<6> <41><439>!<619> <13>It's nice to see you again.<6> You know,<8> I live here now. My move here was suggested to me by <802>.<6> I'm really happy to be here,<8> too! <679>I'd better get some rest now.<6> I hope we can play together as soon as I'm better!
FU Re FirstD <72>Oh,<8> <439>!<6> <13>I'm not sure if you remember me,<8> but I'm <963>.<6> As you can see,<8> I've just moved in. I was invited to move by someone who used to live here but doesn't anymore. But I'm relieved to see that you're still here!<6> I hope you'll come visit me again after I settle in.
FU Re FirstD <72>Boy,<8> am I glad to see you!<6> <13>In case you don't remember who I am,<8> my name is <963>. Someone else who used to live here suggested that I move to town.<6> I'm happy to see that you live here too! I look forward to getting to know you better<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><38> After I clean up these boxes,<8> of course.
FU Re FirstD <72><41><70>!<6> What a nice surprise!<6> <13>I've just finished moving in.<6> I'm your new neighbor here in <470>. Someone who used to live here suggested I move to town,<8> actually.<6><30><18>I'm really glad I did,<8> because the museum is great<8>.<8>.<8>.<214>and it gives us the chance to get to know each other!
FU Re FirstD <72>Oh,<8> <70>!<6> <13>I'm glad I finally get to say hello.<6> I've been living in <107> for more than a week. Someone who used to live here asked me to move in,<8> but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214>Well,<8> I'm glad you're here now! I know you're busy,<8> but if you have any free time, you should come over to play.
FU Re FirstD <649>I can't believe it's been a week already<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13> Oh, oops!<6> I drifted off in thought for a moment. <616>Oh,<8> it's you!<6> Did you know I live in <107> now?<6><13> I'm excited about being your new neighbor. Originally I moved at the request of someone else,<8> but I can see now it was a great decision anyway.
FU Re FirstD <13>Oh, <439>!<6> Long time,<8> no see.<6> It's <963>.<6> Did you know that I live here now? Someone who used to live here came to my old town and convinced me to move.<6> So here I am! I'm glad to see you're still around.<6> <212>I think you and I could grow to be very good friends.
FU Re FirstD <649>I can't believe it's been two weeks already<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13> Oh, oops!<6> I drifted off in thought for a moment. <616>Oh,<8> it's you!<6> Did you know I live in <107> now?<6><13> I'm excited about being your new neighbor. Originally I moved at the request of someone else,<8> but I can see now it was a great decision anyway.
FU Re FirstD <13>Oh, <439>!<6> Long time,<8> no see.<6> It's <963>.<6> Did you know that I live here now? Someone who used to live in <107> came to my old town and convinced me to move here. I'm glad to see you're still around.<6> <212>I think you and I could grow to be very good friends.
FU Re FirstD <13>Do you remember me,<8> <70>?<6> It's <963>.<6> I moved to town not very long ago. Someone who used to live here said I should try it. <638><15>Excuse me.<6> I'm afraid I've caught a cold recently. <679>I'd really like to spend more time with you once I'm better.<6> Drop by anytime!
FU Re FirstD <13>Oh,<8> hello!<6> Do you remember me,<8> <70>?<6> I was still living in <1540> until just recently. <679>Sadly,<8> the person who suggested I move here has also moved away,<8> and now I've caught a nasty cold. But I look forward to us getting to know each other after I get better.
