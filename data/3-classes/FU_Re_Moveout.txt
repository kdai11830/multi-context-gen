FU Re Moveout <214>I'm finally ready to move to a new town.<6><16> I thought it over for a long time and did lots of research. <13>And I think it's time to move on.<619> <87>I hope you'll celebrate this turning point in my life with me!
FU Re Moveout <28>Did you come to help me move?<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><72>Oh!<670> You've been worrying about me since we talked last.<30><214>It's all right.<670> As you can see, I'm doing just fine!
FU Re Moveout <72>I was just thinking that I needed to come say good-bye to you!<30><214>After all, <8>it was really kind of you to give me advice about moving.<30><13>We won't be living in the same town anymore, but I hope you never forget me!
FU Re Moveout I'm so sorry! I've been running all over the place lately<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <219>Still,<8> I should have told you sooner. <354>It just never seemed like the right moment.<619><13> Anyway,<8> I want to thank you for being my friend. I may be moving to a new town,<8> but I promise never to forget you, <70>!
FU Re Moveout <72>Oh?<6> I don't think we've met, have we?<619> <13>I live here in town,<2261> but the truth is<8> I'm actually moving soon. I may be leaving town,<8> but <214>I'm sure you'll love it here!
FU Re Moveout <72>Oh, <70>!<6> <214>Did you come over to play?<30>Unfortunately,<8> I'm getting ready to move.<619> <13>But I'm glad we got to chat once more before I left. Even though I won't be here to see your smile,<8> I hope you keep coming back to <107> to play!
FU Re Moveout <72>Oh my!<6> And who might you be?<619> <13>I live in this town now,<8> but <38>the truth is I'll be moving soon. <214>I won't be here anymore, but you should visit again.<8> It's a great place!
FU Re Moveout <214>Oh, <70>!<670> I've been wanting to see you!<30><16>Unfortunately,<8> I won't be able to play with you here in <107> anymore.<619> I'm moving soon. The thing is,<6><38> I don't exactly know where I'm moving to yet.<1308><1099> Live in my town! That sounds rough...
FU Re Moveout <13>Oh no!<670> I'll be just fine.<30><214>I'm surprised by how freeing it is,<8> not having any plans and letting the winds take me where they may. <40>So, please don't worry about me!<6> I hope we meet again someday.
FU Re Moveout <26>What?!<680> Are you sure about that?<619> <87>Living in the same town as you sounds like too much fun! Now that that's settled,<8><7> I'll have to change the shipping labels on all my boxes to say <470>! <214>So, I'll be busy for a while,<8> but once I get settled into my new home,<8> we should play together!
FU Re Moveout <26><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>What?!<6> Do you mean it?<619> <87>It'd be great to be neighbors again!<30><214>Then, I'll keep getting ready to move!<619> Let's talk again later.
FU Re Moveout <72>Oh!<670> Have we met before?<6> <214>I'm <963>.<30><16>I'm sure we'd be good friends if we got to know one another,<8> but <38>as you can see,<8> I'm getting ready to move. Truth is,<8> I haven't nailed down where I want to go yet<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><1308><1099> What about my town? Good luck!
FU Re Moveout <214>Thanks!<619> I think leaving my comfort zone like this will encourage me to try new things. I'm looking forward to it!
FU Re Moveout <26>What?!<6> Do you mean it?<30><214>This is the first time we've met,<8> but you've been so kind to me.<619> I'm really touched! <649>It must be fate<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><214> Well,<8> I accept your invitation to move in.<6><40> I'll see you in <470> in a day or two!
FU Re Moveout <38>I've finally got all my stuff boxed up.<6> <53>I have way too many books<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
FU Re Moveout <38>If I don't label each box with its contents,<6> <31>I won't know where to find anything later!
FU Re Moveout <28>Now,<1172> which box did I put <2058> in?<30><38>I want to reread it as soon as I move,<8> so it's got to be where I can find it right away!
FU Re Moveout <13>I hope that somewhere,<1172> someday,<1172> we'll meet again,<8> <42>.
FU Re Moveout <214>By the way, <8>I decided to make <1540> my new home!<30><13>If you ever feel like seeing me,<8> please come over for a spell!
FU Re Moveout <214>I'm going to be <963> of <1540> soon.<619> Please come visit me if you get the chance.
FU Re Moveout <214>We'll meet again soon in <470>!<30><87>I have a lot to learn about living there,<8> so I hope you're willing to show me the ropes!
FU Re Moveout <649>Just think,<670> soon we'll be neighbors again!<619> <367>I'm pleased as punch about that, <8><42>!<30><214>Let's be the kind of neighbors who drop in on each other unannounced and borrow each other's things.
FU Re Moveout <13>The fruit here in town is so good for making tarts.<30><214>But I need a change of pace<1172> and the chance to explore a new locale.<30><38>I sure hope there's a good town out there that I can call home<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><1308><1099> What about my town? I hear ya...
FU Re Moveout <214>You know,<8> I rather like the idea of traveling from town to town in search of something grand. <40>I'm just going to stay positive!<670> Please wish me luck!
FU Re Moveout <26>Do you really mean that?! <214>If you feel that way,<2261> I just know I can't go wrong by moving there! I don't even need to visit to make up my mind.<6> <87>Being neighbors with you will be great!
FU Re Moveout That's a great idea!<6> <214>As long as it won't be any trouble for you,<8> I'd love to move there! <87>This means we can get together and eat <33> just like we used to!
