AN FreeC Furniture <18>I'll never forget this one movie I saw where this evil lady boss had a giant fish tank in her hideout. I might be trying to copy that with my <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><36>But, man, it's a challenge trying to keep it out of the sun and keep the water clean and keep the fish fed! <38>It makes me think of the bad guys having the same problems, and that just cracks me up, <6><42>!<6><16>
AN FreeC Furniture <72>Oh, right!<15> <16>Do you know a lot about pictures and art and stuff?<15><53> I don't know much about it myself. But doesn't it seem like, with a lot of pictures these days, it's hard to tell which side goes up? I'm no good with complicated things like that, <42>.
AN FreeC Furniture <18>I'm not the only one living in this house!<15> My <13><834> is like a family member! <16>Some people say it's not a big deal, but raising a plant takes a lot of hard work! <87>But you get back what you put into it, so it's worth it! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <214>The song playing right now is called <375><1831><375>.<15><30>It's one of my favorites! <18>No other song gets me going like this one<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><13>When I wake up, I gotta listen to this tune first thing in the morning!

AN FreeC Furniture <23>Hey! You'll enjoy this. I found a way to get myself into a cooking mood!<30><44>When all else fails, I just gotta have my <834>!<30><16>When I look at it, I just think, "Better hop to it!"<30><13>Course, having the drive and having the talent are two very different things, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <13>So you've got a way you like to sleep, I'm assuming.<30><16>But are you like me? Are you in the special socks-on club?<15> <23>Oh yeah! It's true! I sleep with my socks on!<30><18>Naturally it helps fight the cold<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>but it also keeps me calm somehow.<30><13>Anyway, I'm always on the lookout for new and better sleepable socks!
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture <36>I went ahead and splurged on <77> <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<6>but I can't find time to sit on it lately. <38>It does make a good place for putting folded laundry, though! <6><41><42>!<15>
AN FreeC Furniture <214>I love to relax by flopping down on the ol' <834> after dinner! <38>Course, as soon as I do, visitors always show up, <6><42>!<15><16>

AN FreeC Furniture Hey, when you buy furniture, do you make sure to measure your room?<15> <38>Or do you just take a gamble? <18>My <834> was a gamble for sure! After I bought it, I was nervous all the way home! <13>But in the end it worked out! It fits perfectly! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture <18>There are so many gyroids, it can actually be a lot of work to find one that's perfect for you! <212>As for me and my favorite little <834>, fate brought us together, <6><42>!

AN FreeC Furniture <26>Oooh, guess what!<15> <16>I thought of a way to break up the boredom of cleaning house! <23>Use luxury cleaning goods!<15><214> The kind that are so expensive, you feel like you have to use them! <53>Do you think I can find a vintage <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<6>and some other fancy stuff? <6><41><42>?
AN FreeC Furniture <28>Do you take your time when it comes to appraising fossils? Or do you make snap judgments? <18>Me, I guess I take my time!<15><13> I keep a bunch I dig up, and then I appraise only the ones I want out! <36>I mean, if you just look at all of 'em right away, what fun is that? <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <18>I realized the other day that tea drinking varies quite a bit from person to person. <44>Me<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I guzzle the stuff like crazy!<15> It seems like I'm always washing everything tea related! <87>If you're wondering why my <834> is so shiny, that's the reason, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <7>I think toilet placement in a house is very important! This is something I believe very strongly!<30><28>I mean, it's a place you're gonna go at least once a day, right? You need to plan your installation carefully! <18>You can probably tell I've been thinking about this issue for quite some time<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><13>Course, once I make up my mind, it's not like I'm gonna announce it or anything! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture You probably know this, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I'm really not a morning person.<30><18>But I figured out you can't beat that <834> smell to get you going in the morning! <7>Plus, I feel like I gotta get up and water 'em right away so they'll stay fresh and smelling great! <36>So I hop right out of bed every day! Only<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>when I'm done watering, I get tired again! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture The other day in the middle of the night, my <834> started making noise! <31>Man, it freaked me out! Even after I realized what it was, it took me forever to get back to sleep!<15> That sound<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I don't know how I'll ever get used to it, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture <26>Oh my gosh!<15><16> Did you hear about this new exercise program that only requires a scale? <53>They say the trick is to step on the scale every morning<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><18>and then spend the next hour stepping on and off it really fast about 5,000 times<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture <26>I just realized something!<15> <16>Do you know what happened to all the stuffed animals you had as a kid? <13>I still have mine.<15><16> I've lived with them longer than I lived with my parents.<6> I just can't get rid of my animals! <87>My <834> alone is full of memories! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <13>This dude I don't even know very well gave me a stuffed animal.<15><28> What would you do in that situation? <16>The correct answer is<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><23>take the animal!<15> <7>Stuffed animals are innocent in all this. They just want a home! <13>Well, most of 'em except for my <834>. He's a bit of a rebel, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <1833><1834><1835>L
AN FreeC Furniture <72>Hey, you know something?<15> <16>Don't clean <77><834> too much! <53>If their smell disappears, they won't be able to find their home when they come back from a vacation! <18>I guess it'd be like if someone turned your house into a store while you were on a trip. <15><13>Makes sense!

AN FreeC Furniture <13>Hey. Let's talk about the good ol' <1622><8> for a sec. Local specialty, right?<15><18> Right! We ought to do some branding and marketing and stuff!<15><44> Like, we could make <1622> furniture! <16>I mean, just look at my <834>!<15> <13>Cool, right? <294>When I saw it, I knew it was something special, <6><42>!

AN FreeC Furniture <28>You ever pull up trash and stuff when you're fishing?<30><38><41><834><909>s<375> are really convenient for times like that!<15><13><30><18>I don't get how it works, but if you put garbage in, it'll just kinda go away! Like magic! It might not look cool having one in your house, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>you can't argue with convenience, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <87>Hee hee! Having guests over sure does brighten up the place! Yeah! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <18>Every time I move, I take stock of my furniture<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>but it seems like I'm always gaining stuff, <6><42>.
AN FreeC Furniture <18>Some of the stuff in here I bought, and some of it people gave to me<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><13>But it's all bound by a common destiny! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <18>Everyone who visits says the furniture I've got seems like stuff I'd have<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <28>What are they implying?
AN FreeC Furniture <18>Well, I can't give you much of a welcome, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>feel free to hang out!
AN FreeC Furniture <13>Heh! It feels weird having you here in my place, <6><42>!
AN FreeC Furniture <26>Oh! By the way<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>you can use to check out this room from all sorts of different angles! <212>Just don't go using it to find any hidden messes! <6><41><42>!
