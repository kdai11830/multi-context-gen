FU Ev Xmas <214>Can you believe it's finally <375>Toy Day<375>?<6> I hope <375>Jingle <375>gets here soon.
FU Ev Xmas <87>I just can't relax until <375>Jingle <375>gets here.<619> <38>Although it'll be hard to calm down after<8> too.
FU Ev Xmas <214>When I was little,<8> I'd line up all my dolls on <375>Toy Day<375>.<6> Then we'd wait for presents together!
FU Ev Xmas <214>I've been baking cookies all day.<6><18> I think <375>Jingle <375>should have a tasty snack to help him refuel.
FU Ev Xmas <53>Do you think <375>Jingle <375>has lots of brothers and sisters?<6> Or is he an only reindeer?
FU Ev Xmas <214>It's snowing outside!<6> It looks like someone popped a big bag of flour over the world.<6><40> Hee hee!
FU Ev Xmas <40>Did you see?<6> It's snowing outside!<6><13> Maybe I'll go out and make a snow angel later.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Oh,<1172> it's so beautiful when it snows like this.<6> I just love to watch it piling up outside my windows.
FU Ev Xmas <367>Look at all that snow!<619> It makes me want to curl up with a book about the abominable snowman!
FU Ev Xmas <141>It's <375>Toy Day<375>!<619><28> I wonder if someone gave <375>Jingle <375>presents when he was young.
FU Ev Xmas <40>I hope you're enjoying <375>Toy Day<375> as much as I am!<6> This crisp air is so refreshing,<8> <42>.
FU Ev Xmas <214>Are you having a good <375>Toy Day<375>?<6> I was just admiring the lights on all the trees.<6> They're so pretty!
FU Ev Xmas <214>Mm,<8> I wonder which picture book I should look at tonight.<6> It's my own little <375>Toy Day<375> tradition.
FU Ev Xmas <214>It's finally <375>Toy Day<375>!<6> Can't you feel the excitement in the air?
FU Ev Xmas <87>I just love playing in the snow!<6> My fingers get cold,<8> but my heart stays warm.
FU Ev Xmas <214>I've been catching snowflakes on my tongue.<15><18> My record so far is 29 successful attempts in a row.
FU Ev Xmas <40>It's really coming down now!<619><31> You don't think it's turning into a blizzard,<8> do you?
FU Ev Xmas <13>It's like someone's sprinkling sugar on our heads!<15><26> Quite a bit of sugar,<8> actually.
FU Ev Xmas <26>Oh my<8>, would you look at the time?<619><13> It's all right.<6> I'm sure <375>Jingle <375>will start passing out gifts soon<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
FU Ev Xmas <31>I can't believe it's already this late!<6> You don't think <375>Jingle <375>left our gifts back at the North Pole, do you?
FU Ev Xmas <13>I heard <375>Jingle<375>'s really busy this year. <6>Something about a ribbon shortage.<30><38>But I'm sure he'll start handing out gifts soon<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>right?<15><16>
FU Ev Xmas <214>You look festive in that,<8> <70>. In fact, you look a little like Santa.
FU Ev Xmas <26>Oh! <6>For a moment,<8> I thought you were Santa!<15><16>
FU Ev Xmas <214>Wearing that,<8> you look a little like Santa!<6> You'll get everyone in town excited if you're not careful.
FU Ev Xmas <617><8>.<8>.<8>.<15>I hope <375>Jingle <375>comes by soon.<6> I'm not sure how much longer I can stay awake.
FU Ev Xmas It's long past my bedtime.<619> <167>Y-<8>you don't think my name is on <375>Jingle<375>'s naughty list,<8> do you<8>.<8>.<8>.? <248><97>He should have been here by now!
FU Ev Xmas <72>Santa?!<15><13> Sorry about that.<6> I'm very sleepy,<8> and you look a little like him.
FU Ev Xmas <72><97><16>For a moment, I thought you were Santa!<619><38> It must just be what you're wearing.<6> Sorry about that.
FU Ev Xmas <87>A present delivered by Santa himself!<6> I should have known better than to doubt the North Pole crew. <214>They always come through for us!
FU Ev Xmas <40>I hope one day I'll be able to bring as much happiness to the world as Santa does.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Santa really does bring gifts to all the good boys and girls.
FU Ev Xmas <87>I got a present from Santa!<6><13> It's not exactly what I wanted,<8> but it's the thought that counts.
FU Ev Xmas <87>I got a present from Santa!<6> It's not exactly what I asked for,<8> but that's OK.<6> I'm grateful to receive a gift.
FU Ev Xmas <214>Did you know Santa himself gave me a present?<6> Isn't that great?
FU Ev Xmas <214>Santa!<6> Did you know that <375>Jingle <375>the reindeer is looking for you?<6> I guess it's easy to get separated.
FU Ev Xmas <40>Santa!<6> <375>Jingle<375> the reindeer is looking for you.<6><13> How did he ever lose track of you in that bright-red outfit?
FU Ev Xmas <214>Did you see <375>Jingle<375> the reindeer walking around town?<6> He looks a little flustered. <18>Maybe one of us should go talk to him and see if he needs help!
FU Ev Xmas <13>I heard that <375>Jingle<375> the reindeer is in town.<6> Have you met him?<6> It isn't really <375>Toy Day<375> until he gets here!
FU Ev Xmas <26>Santa?<6> I can't believe you're here in <107>!<30><13>But<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>wait.<15> Why would you be here now?<6> And where's <375>Jingle<375>?<6> He's not normally here until later.<30> I'm not quite sure what's going on.
FU Ev Xmas <40>Santa?!<6> Did you get my suggestions for improving the aerodynamics of your sleigh?! <13>But<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I didn't hear any jet engines.<15> And <375>Jingle <375>doesn't normally come to town until later<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Hmm...
FU Ev Xmas <26>Santa?<619> That can't really be you,<8> can it?!<30>I wasn't expecting to see you,<8> and certainly not without <375>Jingle <375>to help!<30> Well,<8> I'm sure <375>Jingle <375>will clear things up when he gets to town later.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Thank you so much for the present,<8> Santa!<6> I promise to take good care of it.
FU Ev Xmas <40>Thank you so much for the present,<8> Santa!<15><212> I think you're the nicest man in the whole world.
FU Ev Xmas <214>Thank you so much for the present!<6> You can count on me to be good next year too.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Santa,<8> is it really you?!<15><28> But where's your bag?<619> <31>Y<8>-you didn't forget it,<8> did you?!
FU Ev Xmas <72>Santa!<6> Is it really you?<619><28> But if it is you,<8> where's your bag?<6> Do you remember the last place you had it?
FU Ev Xmas <72>Oh!<6> Santa!<6><87> I can't believe it's really you.<6> Welcome to <107>!<30><28>Excuse me,<8> but<8>.<8>.<8>.did you forget your bag?

FU Ev Xmas <214>Happy <375>Toy Day<375>,<8> Santa!<619> <212>Um,<8> excuse me,<8> but is there anything in your bag for me?
FU Ev Xmas Oh<8>.<8>.<8>.I see.<6> Maybe I wasn't as good all year as I thought.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Hooray!<8> Thank you!<6> Can I open it now?<6> Please, can I?!
FU Ev Xmas <87>Yay!<6> I can't wait to open it!

FU Ev Xmas <28>It-<670>it's <77><834>.<6><619> Huh.<15><38> Not that I'm ungrateful or anything!<6> It's very nice.
FU Ev Xmas <26>Oh!<6> You!<6> I<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><141> This is exactly what I wanted!<6> Thank you,<8> Santa!
FU Ev Xmas <40><41><77><834>!<6> Oh Santa,<8> this is exactly what I wanted!<6> <375>Jingle <375>must have told you, huh?
FU Ev Xmas <40>Santa,<8> you're amazing!<6> Somehow you knew exactly what I wanted.
FU Ev Xmas <214>Keep up the good work,<8> Santa!<6> I won't keep you any longer.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Thank you so much,<8> Santa.<6> I'm going to show your present to my friends.
FU Ev Xmas <87>You're so kind,<8> Santa!<6> You remind me a little of my friend, <439>.
FU Ev Xmas <214>You're the best,<8> Santa.<6> Now I can go to sleep happy.
FU Ev Xmas <31>Oh no,<8> where's your bag?<6> Did you check with <375>Jingle<375> the reindeer?
FU Ev Xmas <121>Oh no,<8> is your bag missing?!<619> What did <375>Jingle<375> the reindeer say?<6> Doesn't he usually carry it for you?
FU Ev Xmas <214>You're back!<619><13> Now, where did I put those cookies<8>.<8>.<8>.<796><1099> Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas <87>Santa,<8> you're still here!<6> Can I help you with anything?<796><1099> Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas <214>Santa!<6> It must be hard to work this late at night,<6> but I'm really glad you haven't left yet!<796><1099> Here's your present! I'd better be going.
FU Ev Xmas Um,<8> Santa<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I was<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><212>sort of hoping for a present,<8> and <375>Jingle<375> hasn't come by my house yet<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
