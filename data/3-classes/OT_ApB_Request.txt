OT ApB Request <13><41><70>, I've been thinking about how we don't have <375>police<375> here in <107>. We don't need them for safety, since we don't have any crime here. <53>Hmm. <1172>Except for fashion crimes. <13>Anyway, if we had a police station, it would have a lost and found, which could be useful. And officers would always have the dirt, <1172>I mean, <1172>the latest news on strangers passing through. Since you're the mayor, <1172>how about getting us a police station, OK?<813>
OT ApB Request <41><70>,<8> I've been thinking. <41><107> needs something that would help it stand out. <53>Like <30925> <30927>!<30><18>Yes,<8> that's exactly what we need. I think I'll tell <375>Isabelle <375>about it.<2289> You two can work it out, <8>OK?<813>
OT ApB Request <41><70>,<8> I really think that <107> is lacking a certain something. <53>Like a...? Hmm. <6><23>Oh,<8> I know! <41><77><814><30934>Isabelle <375>about it right away. I'm sure you two can work it into your plans, <8>right?<813>
OT ApB Request <219>Wouldn't it just be lovely if we had something here that made us the envy of other towns? <53>You know, like... <6>Like, well<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><23> <41><77><814>!<30><13>You're the mayor, so I'm sure you can make it happen. <30940> <18>Of course you can, <70>!<813>
OT ApB Request <219>So you're our mayor, right? And you DO know what your most important job is, don't you? <13>Listening to townspeople <1172>like me<1172> tell you what we want improved about this place. Then doing it. That's just how it works, right? <214>Otherwise, what else does a mayor do, <70>? Good. So I think I'm going to tell <375>Isabelle<375> my bright idea. We need <77><814>! <110>Chat with her sometime and make my dreams reality, OK?<813>
OT ApB Request <13>Oh,<8> <70>!<2289> I finally figured out what our town needs to truly succeed,<8> <42>. <41><77><814>! You do agree, <8>right?<619> <128>RIGHT? <36>Sorry. <2289>I'm just making sure my voice is heard. It's SO important to get involved in public issues. Now, <1172>I'll tell <375>Isabelle <375>about it, <8>and you two can make it happen. <214>Wow! <1172>Thanks for listening, <1172>Mayor!<813>
