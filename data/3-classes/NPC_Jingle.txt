NPC Jingle <141>Ho ho ho! Happy holidays!<16><619> Say, kid, you're not from around here, are you? <214>As a holiday messenger, it is my duty to deliver presents to everyone in <107>. <38>Well...everyone who was good this year, anyway. <214>You may see another present messenger in your town. If you do, be sure to ask for a present! It's an easy way to see if you've been good this year! See ya!
NPC Jingle <110>Are you enjoying a festive holiday evening?<619> <214>I really hope so!<30>Say, <28>would you mind standing on my left side when we're talking, kid?<30><40>I look best from that angle.<30><110>I sound best from that angle too!<214>
NPC Jingle <214>Ho ho ho and hey hey hey!<619> Are you out visiting towns tonight? <8>It's such a lovely holiday evening, isn't it? I'm here on business, not pleasure.<670> But it's all the same to me since I love my job! Yeah! <141>I'm a happy little reindeer!
NPC Jingle <110>Happy holidays!<16><8><619> I'm <375>Jingle<375>, the black-nosed reindeer! Isn't this the best time of the year, kid? <141>Snow everywhere, fuzzy hats, and steaming mugs of hot cocoa with mushrooms by the fireplace! <26>Wait. Did I say mushrooms?! I meant marshmallows! <8><214>Mushrooms in hot cocoa would kind of ruin the mood. I'm here in town to do something very important, but it's a secret!<30><219>I'm going to sneak into everyone's houses and leave them presents!<8> <214>Don't tell anyone! <6><219>Um, I know... It's kind of weird if you think about it, <141>but it's all about the presents, so in the end, everyone is happy!
NPC Jingle <53>Sometimes I wish I had a good way to mix things up for people, though.<30><23>If I found someone willing to dress like Santa, I could ask that person to deliver the presents! People like me, but they really LOVE Santa! What a treat it'd be!
NPC Jingle <53>Hmm.<8> Wait just a second.<8><23> That's a pretty sharp suit you got there, kid. It fits you perfectly!<16> How'd you like to help me out?<30><214>If you delivered some presents, we could make everyone happier on a whole new level! Sound good?<849><796><1099> Ho ho yes! Nah, can't do it.
NPC Jingle <53>Hmm.<8> Wait just a second.<8><23> That's a pretty sharp suit you got there. It fits you perfectly!<16> <53>I don't know about those shoes...<8> <214>but to each his own, I suppose!<30>How'd you like to help me out, kid?<30><214>If you delivered some presents, we could make everyone happier on a much bigger scale! Sound good?<849><796><1099> Ho ho yes! Nah, can't do it.
NPC Jingle <167>What?! Really?!<670><30>That's too bad. <8>I was really looking forward to finding a partner who wants to help make people happy. I guess I'll just be a lonely little reindeer this year...
NPC Jingle <72> You will?!<619> <141>That's great! Thank you so much!
NPC Jingle <8>.<8>.<8>.<8><121> Oh, but this just won't work.<619> Seems you have too many items and can't hold any presents. <214>Please drop at least one item and then come talk to me again!
NPC Jingle <40>That <375>Santa bag<375> is a magical sack filled up with presents for everyone here in town! <16>But <670>at dawn, the magic will break and the bag will return to normal. So please be very careful. The presents the town residents requested are inside that bag<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><214>Just think twice when you give out a present, kid. That way, everyone's wishes will be able to come true! <16>I'll be waiting around town until dawn, so deliver all the presents and then return the bag to me. <110>OK, good luck!<680><214>
NPC Jingle <53> Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>I wonder if I can find someone who looks enough like Santa. It'd sure make this <375>Toy Day<375> extra special<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jingle <72> Ho?!<670> Hey, you, what's up?<670> You look exactly like Santa! That's fantastic!<30><649>If people started getting presents from someone like you, I bet that would make them really happy! <16> .<8>.<8>.<670><23><670>Hey, I've got an idea!<30><16>Instead of me, the usual holiday gift giver, why don't YOU <40>deliver the presents to everyone tonight, kid?<849><796><1099> Leave it to me! I can't do it.
NPC Jingle <72> Ho?!<670> Hey, you, what's up?<670> You look exactly like Santa, kid! This is great!<30><53>Your shoes are kind of different, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> Oh well.<110> I guess normal people wouldn't even notice!<8><214> <649>If people could get their presents from someone dressed like Santa, it'd make them so happy! <16> .<8>.<8>.<670><23><670>Hey, I've got an idea!<30><16>Instead of me, the holiday reindeer, why don't YOU<40> deliver the presents to everyone around town?<849><796><1099> Leave it to me! I can't do it.
NPC Jingle <53>Oh, hey, you<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> Uh, <16>why'd you stop pretending <28>to be 100 percent jolly?<670><30>I was hoping you'd deliver presents while wearing the full suit, kid. This makes me a sad little reindeer<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jingle <53>If you could deliver the presents while in that jolly red suit, I bet it would make everyone really happy<8>.<8>.<8>. <28>What do you think?<670> Will you please help make everyone happy, kid?<849><796><1099> Sure! I can't do that.
NPC Jingle Hiya!<619> How have you been since we last talked? <24688> Did you get your item problem all sorted out, kid?<849><796><1099> Yes, indeed! No, not yet.
NPC Jingle <8>Hm<8>.<8>.<8>. This is such a perfect role for you<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <670>What a shame. That makes me a disappointed little reindeer.
NPC Jingle I see. <214>Well then, just let me know when you're ready.
NPC Jingle <8>.<8>.<8>.<670><28>Oh?<619> It looks like you're still carrying too many items, kid.<30><16>You need to have at least one item slot open so that I can give you the presents bag. Come back later!
NPC Jingle Good. It seems you're ready, kid.<670> <214>Please take special care of these!
NPC Jingle <121> Ah! Hey!<670> Why did you change your clothes? You know, the festive suit? You gotta wear the whole thing! This is a real job here, so you need to take it seriously<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> <7> That makes me an annoyed little reindeer...
NPC Jingle Please finish delivering all presents by the time dawn breaks, and then bring the bag back to me! <40>OK, I'm counting on you! Ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle <214>Hiya, kid!<670> So how's the task going?<796><1099> I'm done! I need a break.
NPC Jingle <214>Yeah, you HAVE been working hard!<619> <16><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>But please make sure you're acting festive during work, OK?
NPC Jingle <214>Yeah, you've been working hard!<619> Please do your best to get the job done before dawn comes around!
NPC Jingle <214>Please make sure to stay focused... You need to make the right choices and pass out the correct presents!
NPC Jingle After you deliver everyone's gifts, please bring the bag back to me!<30><214>I have a pretty special present saved for you, so I'll give it to you when you're all done, kid! Ho ho!
NPC Jingle <53>Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <28><1172>Ho?!<619> <16>It looks like you still have some presents left, kid!<30>There are just enough presents for each and every town resident, so come back when the bag is empty.
NPC Jingle <8>.<8>.<8>.<8>Also, when you're delivering the presents, please make sure you're dressed up like Santa! Ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle <53>Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <26><6>Yup, yup!<6> <214>You've indeed delivered everything perfectly, kid!<30><367>Also, <8>I can feel <107> is just brimming with happiness at this exact moment! Oh joy! <16>I bet <18>this is all because you went out and made sure everyone's holiday wishes came true!
NPC Jingle <53>Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <26><6>Yup, Yup!<6> <214>You've indeed delivered presents to everyone, kid!<30><36>I mean, I probably would have been more careful to give the right gifts to the right people, but oh well. <616>I'm sure it was a really tough job<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <40> Well, thank you for all your help!
NPC Jingle Hooray!<670> <214>Now it's finally YOUR turn to receive a present! <616>That's a nice change after helping so much! <141>Since you did such a holly-jolly job, I'll give you a special little present.<2289> It's a <375>festive wreath<375>!
NPC Jingle <214>Thanks to you, I'm sure tonight was a very wonderful and jingly night for everyone in town! Yeah! <141>Mmm. Seeing smiles on every face in town makes me the happiest little reindeer in the world! <16>Well, my work still isn't over, so I've got to go. <40> See you! And ho ho ho!
NPC Jingle Ho! Really?<30><214>I want to give you a present, but your pockets are full! Make some room, and then come see me again!
NPC Jingle <214>You really did a great service today!<619> I can't thank you enough, kid!
NPC Jingle Enjoy the rest of this wintry eve!<619> <141>And have a happy ho ho ho-liday!
NPC Jingle <214>Don't worry. I'll be sure to return to <107> next year to bring love and happiness to all! <40>It would be nice if I could see you again next holiday season!
NPC Jingle <214>Seeing such joy here in <107> was ever so nice. I'm just such a happy little festive reindeer! <141>The smiles that greet me wherever I go are all the presents I ever need!
NPC Jingle <26> Oh, right!<670> <16>Since you're here, can I ask you a favor, kid?<30>When you talk to me, would you mind standing on my left?<8><28><30><16>Oh, <8>there's no particular reason for the request...<30><40>I look the best from that angle.<7739> <110>Ho ho ho!<680><214>
NPC Jingle <214>Hi there. Great look!<619> It seems like you're quite the festive little soul!
NPC Jingle <26><670>Oh, hi there. Nice getup! <214>I think you look just like someone I know!<30><16><1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <53>But, well, the shoes look different.<30><44>You may be able to fool the others,<1172> but I certainly know better!<619> <214><670>Ho ho!
NPC Jingle <26><670>Oh, hi there. Nice look! <40>Why, you look just like Santa in that outfit!<30><214>I'd love it ever so much if you acted like you're really him and spread joy to everyone tonight!<670> <110><1172>Ho ho ho!<7739><214>
NPC Jingle <1172><26> Oh no, <1172>I've stayed too long. <375>Toy Day<375> is well over.<30><214>I'd best be heading off now!<619> <616>See you again next holiday season!
