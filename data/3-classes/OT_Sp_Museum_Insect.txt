OT Sp Museum_Insect <7>It's too bad that a town like <107> doesn't have a better museum. <53>I think this place just needs a little more support from the community.
OT Sp Museum_Insect <649>There are so many interesting bugs in the world<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><7>You just won't find many of them in this museum!
OT Sp Museum_Insect <18>The bug collection at this museum is getting better all the time.<30><103>It's so exciting when a new specimen arrives. <2289>It makes me want to come and visit every day!
OT Sp Museum_Insect <649><41><42>, <8>it's so amazing to see how many different bugs there are in <107>. Listen! <2289>Aren't the sounds they make fascinating?<619> OK, <8><212>that one was just my stomach grumbling.
OT Sp Museum_Insect <214>I heard this place has at least one of every type of insect that lives in <107>. <669>That's amazing! <2289>Someone around here must have some extreme bug-catching skills.
OT Sp Museum_Insect <561>Well,<8> you picked one of the least impressive spots to visit in <107>. <7>This part of the museum could use a little work<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Sp Museum_Insect <18>Our museum has really been trying to improve its collection lately.<30><53>Seeing a new specimen arrive is exciting, <8>but it also reminds me how many we have yet to collect.
OT Sp Museum_Insect <28>Do you have anything like this exhibit in your town?<30><18>Our collection is pretty good,<8> but I know there are still lots of interesting species out there.
OT Sp Museum_Insect <41><26><42>,<8> these little guys sure do make a lot of noise.<30><110>I'd love to borrow about 50 of them for a completely innocent,<8> non- prank-related reason.
OT Sp Museum_Insect I don't mean to brag,<8><18> but this is one of the best museums in the world.<30>In fact, <8>I happen to know that this particular wing houses <25>all of the known insects in <107>!
