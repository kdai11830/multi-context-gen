HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>Wow! Are you visiting this town too?<30>Let's have as much fun as we can before it's time to go back home! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>I've been to a lot of towns, and I can tell this town is cozy and quiet!
HA Sp Camp_Tent I came here seeking solitude as part of my training, but this place is really warm and welcoming. <36>At this rate, I'm ready to just call this whole adventure a vacation! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <28>Don't you think this town is nice?<30><214>I mean, I don't really know what it is, but it feels like it perfectly fits my lifestyle or something!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <18>I went out for a run without paying much attention, and I ended up here!<30><214>Since it feels so nice here, I decided to just camp for a while.<30><110>This is turning into an impromptu vacation! Ha ha!<15><13>
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>Heya! Do you live in this town?<30><40>The camping is pretty good here, you know?<15><13> I've decided to spend some quality time here!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <18>I was really focused on running. I ran and ran and ran. And when I looked up, I was in this town! <53>I wonder how far I ran<8>.<8>.<8>.<15><28> Maybe a hundred miles or so?<30><110>Anyway, I just need to rest my old muscles for a bit!!<15><13>
HA Sp Camp_Tent <616>Hey! Do you think it's OK if I camp here for a while?<30><110>I'm just asking to be nice. As you can see, I'm already camping here!<15><13><30>I'll just stay here for a little while.<6> Nice to meet you,<8> <42>.
HA Sp Camp_Tent Hmmm. I can't decide where exactly I want to build a house!<30><23><1152>But, hey!<619> Having no plans at all could actually be pretty cool!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <53><8>.<8>.<8>.<15><26>Whoa,<6> I'm sorry!<30><36>I was just thinking about what kind of training would be best for this area.<8> <41><42>.
HA Sp Camp_Tent <18>Nice! The air here is so fresh!<30> But I guess once I start living here, I'll take it for granted, huh?<30><31>Somebody out there! Please help me remember to appreciate fresh air!<8> <41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>I was invited by <802>. That's how I decided to move here!<30><87>I hope you don't mind if this town gets a bit noisier now that I'll be doing my training here!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <87>I'm moving into this town, so I hope we'll be good neighbors!<30><18>Just so you know, I already have <802>'s blessing to move in!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>I'm going to be a resident of this town!<8> <41><42>!<30><18>I talked to <802><6> and decided to move here.<30><110>All right! I'm gonna whip everyone in this town into shape!<15><13>
HA Sp Camp_Tent <36>Phew, it took me a while to set up this tent!<30><40>It's OK, though. It was kind of like a workout, and I love working out!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <18>Camping is all about enjoying things some people consider inconvenient. <8><41><42>! <214>But now that I think about it, this is actually pretty luxurious!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <7>To me, camping is all about training!<30><87>I spend my time doing sit-ups, not sleeping!<8> <41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <26>Oh! I have a great idea!<30><87>I bet people back in my town would be surprised if I work out a lot and get super buff, don't you think? <16><8>.<8>.<8>.<15><354>Although I guess there's always the risk no one would notice.
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>When I'm in a small place like this,<6> it's kinda easy to give up secrets.<30><50>For example<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I was really into comic books until not too long ago<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><44>Heh heh! Now whether you believe that or not is entirely up to you! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <367>I went running around the trees, and the cold breeze felt so good!<30><40>This town is really nice! Makes me think I might wanna live here!<796><1099> Just move in! ...
HA Sp Camp_Tent This is totally out of the blue,<6><28> but what brings pride to this town?<30><16>.<8>.<8>.<15><36>There must be something, right?<30><16>Well then,<6><319> I can be the face and character of this town!<30><53>Hmm. But for me to do so, I'll need to move here<8>.<8>.<8>.<796><797> You should! No, thanks.
HA Sp Camp_Tent <214>I really like your town!<30><18>You know, it really feels like this is the type of place that would be good for my complexion! Yeah<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> This is way too nice a place to just say good-bye to once I'm done camping. <8><41><42>!<796><1099> You should move here! Please come again!
HA Sp Camp_Tent <110>Ha ha! Does it make you happy to hear good things about your town?<15><13><30><214>I'm not the type to just hand out empty compliments!<6> Be proud of your town! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Camp_Tent That's too bad! I would've been great for your town, but... Oh well.
HA Sp Camp_Tent <40>Of course! I'll come again for sure! I just don't know when that will be,<8> <42>.
