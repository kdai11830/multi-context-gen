ZK Sp Camp_Tent <219>I think I'd like to learn more about <107><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><38>After all, I'll be moving here pretty soon,<8> <42>!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <53><2289>Where should I build my house?<20879> Perhaps near the shopping district so I'll be near the fashion<8>.<8>.<8>.<20879>? Or maybe close to the ocean so I can live adventurously<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<30><28>Hey, you guys don't have any tree houses around here, do you?<8> No?<8> <18>That's cool. I hate heights.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <41><70><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><28>can I just move in with you?<619> <40>Hah ha! <8>Just kidding!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <219>Actually<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I've decided to move to <107> in the very near future,<8> <42>. <38>I just couldn't say no to that invitation from <802><41394> <20476> <20476> <20476> we'll be neighbors soon!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent To tell you the truth<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I'm about to become a resident of <107> <13>in the near future,<8> <42>. <38>Yeah! <41><802> insisted I move here, and I couldn't refuse<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><13>I'll be sure to come by and say hi after I move in,<8> so I'll be seeing you again sometime soon!

ZK Sp Camp_Tent <38>Every now and then,<2289> it feels nice to just get out and go tent camping somewhere fun,<8> <42>. <649><2289>It kinda feels like resetting your mind<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>and it brings back good old memories from the past.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <38>Sometimes<2289> it's nice to experience the world from a tent,<8> <42>. <7>This kind of experience<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>is what makes up the color of <963>'s life, little by little. <649>I wonder what color my life is now<8>.<8>.<8>.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent One time I woke up and I wasn't in my tent or my sleeping bag! I was just sleeping outside! <38>That was a good experience, all things considered.<8> <18>It proved I could be close to nature,<8> <42>!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <40>Outdoor food is the best!<20879> <53><2289>I think what makes it even better is the fresh air!<2289> <13>Because the air is so clean,<2289> the food just tastes much better than usual, don't you think,<8> <42>?
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <7>I'm outside,<2289> but it doesn't seem like it<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <649><2289>When I'm in a tent, it feels like I'm living in a small universe<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <53><41405><2289> while camping here in <107><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><7>There's something in this town<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> that feels like it matches with me.<619> Perhaps <214>the warm smiles?<796><797> You should move here! It's just in your head.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <38>For some odd reason,<2289> I feel like someone is staring at me today.<30><26>Could this mean<671>.<671>.<671>.<671><28><107> wants me to pack up and move here?<20879><796><797> I think so! I have no idea.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <13><41><107> is so nice!<20879> It makes me feel relaxed, like my hometown<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30>The people seem to be nice as well.<2289> I guess this would be the ideal place to live, yeah,<8> <42>?<796><797> You should move here! It's not so special.
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <38>I guess I was just excited from my camping trip,<8> <42>.<30><13>Anyway,<2289> I'll enjoy the rest of my vacation as much as possible!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <26>Oh,<2289> this is an unlikely situation<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <212><2289>Perhaps I was swallowed up by the unique mood of this town? <38>Anyway,<2289> I'll be sure to enjoy every last bit of my time here!
ZK Sp Camp_Tent <38>I think you should show a bit more pride in your own town!<30><13><41><107> is very special!<619> <219>At least, I feel that way<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
