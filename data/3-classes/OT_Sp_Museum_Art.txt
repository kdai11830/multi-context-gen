OT Sp Museum_Art <7>I know this place kind of seems like a big empty room,<8> but it's actually our art museum. <53>I think the people in <107> appreciate fine art,<8> but nobody has been donating any. <23>Maybe you can help turn that around,<8> <70>. <2289>This place has the potential to be great<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Sp Museum_Art <561>This place is still pretty disappointing to visit.<30>It's getting better,<8> but we still need help from more people like you,<8> <70>!
OT Sp Museum_Art <103><41><42>,<8> this collection is really starting to come together.<30><18>If we keep adding new pieces,<8> this will be a real art destination before long!
OT Sp Museum_Art <18>This art collection has really put <107> on the map.<30><669>And it's all thanks to your generosity.<2289> <41><42>, <8>thank you!
OT Sp Museum_Art <25>I don't think there's another museum around that can match our collection here in <107>. <367>I always wanted to live in a town with a world-class art scene.<2289> <41><42>!
OT Sp Museum_Art Oh no<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I'm embarrassed for you to even see this place.<30><28>Do you realize it's supposed to be an art museum? <2289><31>But there's barely any art!<2289> <41><42><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Sp Museum_Art <36>I know this gallery is a bit<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>lacking at the moment. <2289>But it has shown some promise recently. <649>I think <107> has the potential to be a great art destination. <2289><219>Give us a second chance and visit again.
OT Sp Museum_Art <28>Does your town have a gallery like this,<8> <70>?<2289> How does the art collection compare to this one? <18><41><107> is starting to get a reputation as a real art town. <25><2289>And I think it's well deserved.
OT Sp Museum_Art <103>This gallery is becoming one of the hottest art destinations around.<30><38>It's so exclusive that there's only room for a few more artists<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Sp Museum_Art <25>Well, what do you think?<2289> Is this not the greatest art museum you've ever seen? I don't mean to brag, <8>but<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>well,<8> maybe I do mean to brag.<2289> <40><41><42>!
