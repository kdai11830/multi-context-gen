NPC Evaluation <375>"Why, it's amazing, and I truly mean that!<1172> This town is simply the best!<30>"They've clearly worked very hard! This old man is really pleased!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Woohoo!<1172> What a glorious town!<670> <375>Pav<375> wants to just sprawl out right here and caress the ground<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. "Viva<375><23578>!"<375><2304><286><375>
NPC Evaluation <286><375>"Great galloping grasshoppers! Were I to give this town a rating, I'd say that it's exemplary, old bean!"<375><286>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Goodness gracious! I can say that, even from an academic standpoint, this town is simply the best! Hoo!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"It's great! The very best town ever! I wouldn't mind being mayor again for a town that looks like this!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Well, if I compared it to a letter, it would be written quite well, but the sender's name would be left off! "Anyway, it only has a tiny way still to go, so I hope it continues like this to become the best town ever!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Just between us, in the snowman industry, you'll constantly roll up in between first and second place. "But you always want to aim for that indisputable first place! It's a long, icy road, but keep on rolling!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"I heard a rumor that towns with good environments have low reset rates. Wonder if that's true... "Anyway, there's most definitely no denyin' that this town has a pretty good environment right now!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Well<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> I won't say that it's perfect, but it's really not all that bad either, you know? Getting close, though!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Oh yes, it really has a wonderful feeling!<670> But perhaps... Well, it's also lacking just a little something."<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Well, they're certainly giving it their all! The difficult challenge is the reason town building is so worth it!<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"It seems that <375><107><375> is starting to gain some attention as a popular sightseeing destination! "I hope they continue to work hard to really keep revitalizing this town! Eek eek!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Goodness gracious! Even from an academic standpoint, I must say this town is becoming quite good! "If the town grows like this, I have no doubt that its value will keep soaring ever higher, eh wot?"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"I think it's riding the so-so rails! <325>So average!<286>"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375><23580> It's not a passing grade, but it's not really failing either... <325><375><23583><286> "It's like this town is more than friends but not ready to be a couple yet. It needs real commitment!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"I think it can only go up from here! <325>So far to go!<286>"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Well, let's see now... Things are just getting started, so you'll certainly need to work as hard as you can! "This old man will be keeping an eye on things, so good luck!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Goodness gracious... Even from an academic standpoint, this town is really just getting started, wot! "There are ever so many topics for discussion, so I'd tackle them one at a time to help build this town! Hoo!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Hmmm... When it comes to letter writing and town building, I really think that consideration is the key. "Don't you think everyone in town could benefit from that little bit of good advice?"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Uh... I'm not sure if it's OK to write something like this, so forgive me...<30>"I wonder if they could maybe pay a bit more attention to our town... Perhaps just a little?"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375><23584> It's like this town isn't even like a town at all!<30>"For the honor of our good names, let's completely rebuild this place!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375><23580> This town is not very good in its current state, hm?<30>"It may be time to work hard to turn these lemons into lemonade, yes?"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Er... No comment! Eek eek!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"I'm just gonna say this in advance and this is how everyone in town feels by the way, not just me..." "What's the deal here?!<286> That's all!"<375>
NPC Evaluation <375>"Ahhhh, this is the pits...<670> What's going to happen to this town<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670>? The whole place is just one big mess. "Anyway, there's nothing to like in this town, as far as I can see."<375>
