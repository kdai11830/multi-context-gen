GE Dt Museum_Insect <31>Being in here makes my skin crawl, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Insect <214>I really should start catching bugs again, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Insect I just can't stand being near certain kinds of bugs. But some ARE supercute, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Insect <26>Have any of the bugs gotten on me? I wouldn't even want the pretty ones near me, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Insect <214>It's fun catching bugs, but I release the creepy ones. Yeah, only the pretty ones for me, <42>!
