NPC Grace Visit Not to burst your bubble,<1172> but shoo!<670><7> I'm in town to conduct business, <1172>not sign your autograph book, darling.
NPC Grace Visit <26>Fancy running into you here, darling! Doing a spot of sightseeing, eh?
NPC Grace Visit <25>I'm here on business. If this little burg has one iota of style, I just might open a new boutique here!
NPC Grace Visit I can't just sell my precious clothes here without getting a good look at the place!
NPC Grace Visit Look, darling,<1172> I really don't have the time to give you a much-needed Fashion Evaluation.<670> Sorry!
NPC Grace Visit <36>Really, <1172>the nicest thing I can say about this town so far is that it's relatively peaceful. Let's just hope its citizens are worldly enough to appreciate my fabu<1172> avant-garde style!
NPC Grace Visit <26>Hello there. Are you a native of this little town?<796><797> Yes! Nope.
NPC Grace Visit <36>Just a visitor, then? <1172>Ugh! You're of no use to me. Away with you now, darling!
NPC Grace Visit <13>Of course you are! And you have perfect timing, to boot.
NPC Grace Visit <25>I happen to be the creative force behind a certain ultrafashionable fashion brand. Your precious town is begging me to open a shop here, so I wanted to see the place with my own eyes. I'll only bring my brand here if the citizens are sufficiently style savvy. You interested in fashion, darling?<849><796><797> Yes! Not so much.
NPC Grace Visit <121>You almost sound proud of the fact! Well, I can't waste my time on fashion flops like you.<670> Later!
NPC Grace Visit <13>Of course you are! And with that in mind, you could surely use one of my patented Fashion Evaluations!
NPC Grace Visit <44>I hope you're up to the task! OK, here's how it works. I give you a super-stylish theme... <13>And you get until the end of the day to get yourself styled up in an outfit to match that theme! <36>Of course, I expect to see you coordinate shoes and accessories to go along with your getup. <4074><53>Now, what should your theme be?<23><670><4149>
NPC Grace Visit <13>Shouldn't be too hard for a true stylista like yourself. Just create an outfit based on the theme! <7>Don't forget your deadlineend of the day! <1172>I'll be gone tomorrow, you see. <616>Ciao, darling!
NPC Grace Visit <26>Well, if it isn't<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>you! I get this feeling we've met before, like ships passing in the night. Remind me, honey do you live here in town?<1172> You do, don't you! <670>You've got <107> written all over you.
NPC Grace Visit <7>Darling, <1172>I don't have time to fool around with folks who aren't true residents of this town!<796><1099> I live here. 'Kay, bye!
NPC Grace Visit <36>It's pronounced "aw revwah," darling. Now shoo!<1172> I'm a very busy lady at the moment.
NPC Grace Visit <121>Oh, suddenly you ARE from this town? Did you think I would fall for your little white lie? No matter! <13> If you really are a town resident, perhaps I could use you.
NPC Grace Visit <7>Do you need something else? I really don't have time for someone who doesn't care for fashion...<849><796><1099> Maybe I do care... OK, see ya!
NPC Grace Visit <36>"See ya," indeed. Time for us to part ways. We're worlds apart when it comes to the important things.
NPC Grace Visit <7>You're not stringing me along, are you? Fine, I'll take you at your word. <13>You'll be representing your town in this Fashion Evaluation,<1172> so put your best foot forward, darling!
NPC Grace Visit <26>It's been a while! Have you brushed up your fashion sense since we last met, darling?
NPC Grace Visit <26>It's been too long!<6> I hope you've spent all that time polishing your sense of style.
NPC Grace Visit <36>I need to make sure this town is fashion forward enough to warrant my opening a store here! <561>I can't let the GracieGrace brand appear just anywhere, you know. It would reflect poorly on me if I did! <13>On that note, I need you to assist me in a little Fashion Evaluation. I hope you're up for the challenge!
NPC Grace Visit <26>Ready for your fashion check, darling?<849><8740><1099> Ready! What was the theme? Not yet...
NPC Grace Visit <7>Then SHOO! I'm a very busy lady, so please stop wasting my time.
NPC Grace Visit <13>Don't you sound confident! Well, I happen to have a spare moment, <1172>so let's get started.
NPC Grace Visit Oh, it's you again.<619> What do you want?<849><8740><1099> Revenge! What's the theme? Nothing...
NPC Grace Visit <7>Then why are you bothering me?<670> Darling, I am swamped today, so puh-lease stay out of my way!
NPC Grace Visit <128>You forgot the theme I gave you? How unprofessional of you!<30><13>But at least you're trying, so I'll give you points for that. Try to listen more closely this time. Your theme is...
NPC Grace Visit <44>You're out to clear your good name, eh? Let's see if you managed to pull together a stylish outfit!
NPC Grace Visit <36>I appreciate your fire, but there are rules you must follow! First: no shoes, no service. Second: no accessory, no analysis! An outfit is simply not complete without both of those things. <7>Now stop wasting my time, and go prep yourself before hassling me again.
NPC Grace Visit <36>Chill out, sweet thing. I can't even consider evaluating your style while you're wearing THAT! <7>Before the countess of couture can give you her honest opinion,<1172> you need to ditch that wet suit.
NPC Grace Visit <36>The first rule of fashion is to always have room in your pockets.<6> Go clear those things out, darling!
NPC Grace Visit <26>Back to reap your rewards? Excellent! Then this is for you.
NPC Grace Visit <7>Now listen up, you! That right there is one of my signature pieces <77><834>! You'd better not even DREAM of reselling that, darling.<1172> Comprende?
NPC Grace Visit I'm not completely sold on this town, <1172>but let's just say there's room for consideration.
NPC Grace Visit This has been a successful recon mission, <1172>but I can't make up my mind just yet. I'll be back!
NPC Grace Visit <13>Color me impressed! The chances of my opening a store here have risen dramatically after this visit.
NPC Grace Visit I'm just not ready to commit to opening a store here. A closer inspection is called for, darling!
NPC Grace Visit <53>Time to put some serious thought into what I want my new store to look like. It's gotta be trs chic!
NPC Grace Visit <13>This town has greatly pleased the countess of couture. But I can't say I'm 100 percent sold on it! I'll just leave the big decisions for my next visit!
NPC Grace Visit <13>Swear on a stack of haute-couture catalogs that you'll drop by my new boutique<6>once it's open, that is!
NPC Grace Visit <44>You must be bubbling over with joy about the grand opening of my fantab new boutique!
NPC Grace Visit <53>There's one last thing I've got to do before I skedaddle to greener pastures... Make a surprise appearance at my former assistant's new place of work! <13>She'll be so happy to see me.
NPC Grace Visit Time to get back to the grindstone. And by grindstone, I mean my design studio.<6><36> No rest for the weary!
NPC Grace Visit I still have one more stop on my boutique-location-scouting tour.<30>The town I'm visiting tomorrow begged for me to consider them, and I hate to hurt anyone's feelings!
NPC Grace Visit <13>You know, you can always try again. But next time, <1172>how about you put a little thought into it, darling?
NPC Grace Visit <44>You're probably dying to know why I kicked your outfit to the curb. Well, too bad! It's <1172>YOUR job to figure out what's the big faux pas. Just make sure you come back here when you do!
NPC Grace Visit If you want to try again, get back here soon.<6> I'm out of here once the clock strikes midnight!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Sweaty and <375>sporty<375>!
NPC Grace Visit <25> <375>Cute<375> as a button!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Totally <375>iconic<375>!
NPC Grace Visit <25> <375>Rock 'n' roll<375>, you troublemaker!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Oh so <375>official<375>!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Absolutely <375>ornate<375>!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Fun and <10925>#x0;flashy<375>!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Make with <375>modern <375>times!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Make history in a <375>historical<375> look!
NPC Grace Visit <25> Keep it <375>basic<375>!
