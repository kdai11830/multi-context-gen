OT Q10 Badend <36>That game of hide-and-seek? Oh, I stopped playing AGES ago, <70>.
OT Q10 Badend Oh, <70>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Are you STILL playing hide-and-seek?
OT Q10 Badend <692>

OT Q10 Badend <7>Maybe I hid too well,<8> but I just couldn't wait for you forever,<8> <70>!
OT Q10 Badend Next time we play, I guess I'll have to find an easier hiding spot.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> or you'll have to look harder!
