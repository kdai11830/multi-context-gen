KO Sp Cafe <214>I swear I'm not slacking off!<619> It's just a pain to get back up after I've had a break and some coffee!
KO Sp Cafe <214>I have a lot of stuff I still need to do, but first I need to take a bit of a coffee break,<6> <42>!

KO Sp Cafe <214>The best coffee beans are the <375>Blue Mountain <375>ones!<680> The balance of flavor and richness is perfect!

KO Sp Cafe <214>Real men drink <375>Kilimanjaro<375>!<30><16>The high acidity and bitterness <616>make for a cup with some impact!

KO Sp Cafe <214>I love to put in <375>tons<375> of milk!<680> The flavor gets super mellow!
KO Sp Cafe <214>I think coffee is best with just the <375>regular <375>amount of milk!<680> <561>You can't have too much or too little!
KO Sp Cafe <616>I only like a <375>touch<375> of milk!<680> <214>I think using it as a hidden ingredient helps bring out the real coffee flavor!
KO Sp Cafe You <375>can't<375> put milk in coffee!<680> <18>It'll mess with the true flavor!

KO Sp Cafe <616>I like to go light on the sugar with just <375>1<375> spoon!<680> <214>It's all I need to add a hint of sweetness!
KO Sp Cafe <561>I don't need <375>no<375> stinkin' sugar!<619> <214>What makes coffee COFFEE is the bitterness, don't you agree?
KO Sp Cafe What I like best about <375>Brewster<375> <18>is that he doesn't get too friendly,<8> even if you're a regular! <214>That makes it easy to enjoy a long, relaxing time all by yourself! <110>Sometimes I just need my space!
KO Sp Cafe You'll bug other people if you carry on a loud conversation,<8> so make sure you keep it down! <7>And do your studying at home! Ain't nobody ever learned nothing studying in a coffee shop!
KO Sp Cafe I hear that <375>Brewster <375>changes the way he prepares the coffee to match each individual's preferences. <18>He's not your average Joe! And this ain't your average cuppa joe, either! <110>GAHAHA!
