NPC Prologue 2 <16>Mayor, this <375>town hall<375> will be your base of operations.<30><26>Oh!<670> And I completely forgot to mention I'm on staff here too!<30><214>I'm <375>Isabelle<375>, your secretary, and I'm here to help you in any way I can.
NPC Prologue 2 <16>All right, Mayor, where were we?<680> Ah yes, this <375>town hall <375>will be your base of operations. <214>I'm your secretary, and I'll be glad to help you with whatever you need.<670> I look forward to working with you!
NPC Prologue 2 <16>But<8> if I may be frank, <6><214>I was surprised to see someone as young as you step off the train. <16>I mean,<8> our former mayor held the position for many, many years and was quite set in his ways. <214>But youth is a breath of fresh air. And exactly the new image our town needs!<8> You're perfect for the job!
NPC Prologue 2 <16>But<8> if I may be frank, <6><214>I was surprised to see someone as young as yourself step off the train. <16>I mean,<8> our former mayor held the position for many, many years and was quite set in his ways. <214>But youth is a breath of fresh air. And exactly the new image our town needs!<8> You're perfect for the job!
NPC Prologue 2 <16>All right<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Of course we need you to get started right away on your work as mayor. Therefore,<214> first we must complete your resident registration. A mayor <110>really should be a resident! <16>So<670> what is your name, Mayor?<619> .<8>.<8>.<8><318>Oh, right,<8> <439>. Duh.<680> <13>OK, I have your name. And next<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Prologue 2 <16>See the railroad tracks at the top of the map?<6> Head north from there to get to <375>Main Street<375>.
NPC Prologue 2 <616>Some fresh air and exercise would do you good.<8> A trip to <375>Main Street <375>may be just what we both need! <18>It'll give me a chance to stay here and continue with your registration,<8> and you need to find <375>Nook's Homes<375>. <214>Once you've got a place to live,<670> please come back here and let me know right away!
NPC Prologue 2 .<1172>.<1172>.<1172><41><439>,<8> you haven't decided where to build your house yet, have you? If that's the case, we have to find a plot of land right away!<30> I'm sorry I made you come all this way just to send you back out again... <53>On the other side of the tracks over on <375>Main Street<375>, there's a real-estate office. It's called <375>Nook's Homes<375>.<2289> <40>You really can't miss it once you get to <375>Main Street<375>!
NPC Prologue 2 <72>Oh,<8> one more thing...<6><30><16>Having the town pay for your living costs<214> might be taking the idea of business expenses a bit far. <616>You'll need to pay for things like a home loan on your own.
NPC Prologue 2 <214>Please come back here<670> once you've got a place to live.
NPC Prologue 2 <16><375>Nook's Homes<375> is located on <375>Main<375> <375>Street<375>, just past the train tracks.<30><214>Please check your map for more detailed information.
NPC Prologue 2 What was your home like in your <28>previous town?<30><214>Well, since you're here now, I hope <107> ends up being an even better place for you to live!
NPC Prologue 2 <214>Please return here once you've got your housing situation figured out.
NPC Prologue 2 <16><375>Nook's Homes<375> is located in the <375>shopping district<375> on the other side of the train tracks. <214>It was like that in your previous town, wasn't it?
NPC Prologue 2 <121>Oh no!<286><286><671><286> This is bad!<286>
NPC Prologue 2 <318>I can't believe I completely forgot something so vitally important!<30><31>In order to register you as a town resident,<8> we need your address for the form!
NPC Prologue 2 .<1172>.<1172>.<1172><41><439>,<8> do you have a place to live yet?<619> <53>There aren't any vacant houses here<8>.<8>.<8>.<20879><214>but you can build one! <13>We really should have you decide where you're going to live before we proceed! And here I made you come all the way to the town hall for nothing.<670> <318>I apologize for being so flaky!
NPC Prologue 2 <53>Um,<6> on the other side of the tracks, on <375>Main Street<375>,<8> is <375>N<375><375>ook's Homes<375>, the real-estate office<8>.<8>.<8>. <72>Ah yes!<6> <214>This might make more sense if you take a look at your map!
NPC Prologue 2 <72>Oh!<670> You're <439>, right?<680> <214>Welcome to <470>!
NPC Prologue 2 <214>This is the <375>town hall<375>,<8> where we do what we can to support everyone living here in town. <16>I'm <375>Isabelle<375>! I work here!
NPC Prologue 2 I'm also Mayor <1678>'s personal secretary.<6> <214>I hope you'll ask for my help if you need it!
NPC Prologue 2 <13>I'd like to start registering you<8> as a resident.<619> <28>But have you decided where you're going to live? Until this is sorted out,<670> I really can't complete the registration process.<6> I don't mean to make this hard... <16>but please go to the real-estate office called <375>Nook's Homes<375> and work on getting a home first!
NPC Prologue 2 <16>Please take a quick look at the map.<30><16>Do you see the<8> tracks at the top?<6> Cross the tracks and continue north to get to <375>Main Street<375>.
NPC Prologue 2 <16>Once you've decided where to live,<8> I'll help you get registered officially as a resident. <214>Please come by again<8> once you've taken care of that.
NPC Prologue 2 <214>I hope you find a place to build the home of your dreams.
NPC Prologue 2 <214>Please come back here<670> once you've decided where to live!
NPC Prologue 2 <16><375>Nook's Homes <375>is located in the <375>shopping district<375> on the other side of the train tracks. <214>Please check your map for more detailed information!
