FU FreeF Easter <141>Today is the day we celebrate the arrival of spring!<6> It makes my heart feel light as a feather.
FU FreeF Easter <214>You know what?<6> I just saw a bird's nest with little chicks in it!<6> I wonder what mama bird looks like?
FU FreeF Easter <31>I was fishing just a minute ago, and I caught a colorful egg!<6> It doesn't look like fish roe<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> So what is it?
FU FreeF Easter <72>You'll never guess what I just found while digging for fossils<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> An egg!<30><53>Do you think it's a dinosaur egg?<6> It's in awfully good condition for that.<6> The colors are so bright!
FU FreeF Easter <13>I've been hearing some strange reports today.<619> Apparently some of the rocks have eggs inside!<30><15><26>Wait.<8> What kind of bird could lay its eggs inside a rock?
FU FreeF Easter <72>I was shaking an ordinary tree to<8>.<8>.<8>.<212> well,<8> to see what would happen.<15><16> But when I shook it,<8> an egg fell out! <18>It's too big to be from the birds around here,<8> so someone must have hidden it.<6> Maybe there are more!
FU FreeF Easter <40>Something incredible just happened!<6> I was diving in the ocean to collect marine life when I found an egg. Not a normal egg,<8> either.<6> It's big and colorful.<6><72> Maybe it belongs to a new species<8>.<8>.<8>.a rainbow eggtopus!
FU FreeF Easter <13>I just saw a balloon with a present attached!<6> It looked like a different kind of present too. It's too bad I left my slingshot in my other pockets,<8><18> or I would have shot it down.
FU FreeF Easter <72>I tried to eat one of those strange, colorful eggs I found,<8> but when I bit into it,<8> I found some kind of ticket! Have you tried to eat any eggs yet?
FU FreeF Easter <72>The eggs I've been collecting don't have yolks in them!<6> They're something else entirely!<30><13>You should try eating an egg to see what you find!
