NPC PoliceA Good morning, <439>!<6> You're certainly up early.
NPC PoliceA Good morning, <439>!
NPC PoliceA Good afternoon, citizen.
NPC PoliceA Greetings, citizen!<2289> We're moving into the later part of the day, so be on the watch for mischief!
NPC PoliceA Good evening, <670>citizen!<6> I hope you're not walking around by yourself at this hour.
NPC PoliceA What are you doing out at this hour, <670>citizen?<6> I sure hope you're staying safe, young <5830>#x0;a<5831>la<1382>#x0;.
NPC PoliceA <16><28>How can I be of assistance?<796><1418> What's new in town? I'm just chatting.
NPC PoliceA Understood!<6> Until next time, citizen!
NPC PoliceA Just another peaceful day in <107>, <670>citizen! <670>No mischief to speak of.
NPC PoliceA Well, the town gate is open, so we may receive visitors from other towns. I'm keeping an eye out.
NPC PoliceA It seems we have a visitor from another town. I wonder where our guest is from.
NPC PoliceA It seems we have two visitors from out of town! They'd better behave themselves.
NPC PoliceA We have THREE visitors from out of town! <945><6>I might need to call for backup.
NPC PoliceA <16>By the by,<6> <28>is there something you require of me?<8740><1099>( I found something... Anything unusual? Nope, carry on!
NPC PoliceA <26>You picked up a dropped item?<15> You have my gratitude, citizen, for performing your civic duty! <16>While I'd like to get out there and find the owner right away, I cannot leave my post for even a moment<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Citizen!<6> I hate to ask,<6> but you would be doing this town a great deed by searching for the owner in my place!
NPC PoliceA Yep, this here is the lost and found for <107>.<30>We've had no luck finding the<671> owners of any of these items<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Anything here look familiar?<619> Wait. What am I thinking?!<30>There's no way any of this stuff is yours<6>you're from out of town!
NPC PoliceA As you can see here,<8> I've started a collection of lost items that have been found around town.<30><561>No one has claimed them,<670> so I'm <16>looking for someone to take them off our city's hands. Let me know if you see anything you like,<670> citizen!
NPC PoliceA Looks like you've got yourself <77><834> there. <28>Do you want to keep that item?<849><796><797> I'll take it. Never mind.
NPC PoliceA That's our collection of lost items found from around town.<30><561>No one has claimed them,<670> so I'm <16>looking for someone to take them off our hands. <16>Yes, it looks like you've got yourself <77><834> there. <28>Do you want to keep that item?<849><796><797> I'll take it. Never mind.
NPC PoliceA Oh well. Maybe someone else will want it.
NPC PoliceA Your pockets are too full to carry any more,<6> citizen.
NPC PoliceA It's all yours,<6> citizen!
NPC PoliceA Welcome to the <107> town police station!<619> Please enjoy your visit to our town, citizen!
NPC PoliceA Well, the <375>fortune-teller<375> is open for business in the event plaza.<30>Once I get a break, I'm going to go ask her if any crimes will be committed today.
NPC PoliceA Someone's setting up a tent for <375>Redd's Gallery<375><671> in the event plaza.<30>I might alter my patrol route a little to get a closer look.
NPC PoliceA I hear <375>Saharah <375>is in town. I believe she is out selling wallpaper and carpeting.
NPC PoliceA Every <375>Sunday morning<375>,<670> <375>Joan <375>comes to sell turnips.<680> It's great for people who love turnips,<670> I suppose.
NPC PoliceA I've received reports of a rather stylish giraffe over in the event plaza today. Apparently she has made it her duty to critique any fashions that pass by her.<8> I'm not so sure I approve!
NPC PoliceA You haven't heard? There's a storm brewing off the coast, citizen!<30>The rough waters will often cause foreign objects to wash up on our shore, so watch your step!
NPC PoliceA Hmm... Well, mailman <375>Pete<375><670> usually makes his rounds on <375>weekdays <375>at <375>9 a.m. <375>and <375>5 p.m.<375><30><141>Speaking of which, <8>he recently brought me an important package. Official police business, you know.
NPC PoliceA I saw <375>Phineas <375>a little while ago.<30>He walks around town giving badges to well-behaved children. A bit of an odd fellow, but harmless enough.
NPC PoliceA I just saw <375>Leif<375> from the garden shop walking around town!<30><28>I wonder where he was going.
NPC PoliceA We received an application for a camping permit today.<30><28>I wonder who's planning on camping in <107>.<16> Hopefully not some sort of troublemaker!
