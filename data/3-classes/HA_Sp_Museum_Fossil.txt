HA Sp Museum_Fossil This is such a nice space, but there aren't a lot of fossils here!<30><16>.<8>.<8>.<8><23><1152>Oh, I know! I should probably stand here instead!<30><287><1152>Rawr! I'm a big <963> fossil!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil Oh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I wanted to see more fossils, <8><42>.<30><31>At this rate, I'll turn into a fossil before they get some new ones!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <87>The collection here is simply amazing! All the nooks and crannies are filled with fossils!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <367>This is like a dreamland where we can find all kinds of cool fossils!<30><31>Ohhh! This is crazy! I wish I could live here!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <53>If I had encountered dinosaurs when they were alive<8>.<8>.<8>.<15>I bet we would have been good rivals!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <87>Eventually, I plan on getting as big as a dinosaur. <15><25>So say hello to a future fossil!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <26>This is really awesome<8>.<8>.<8>.<15><7> Dinosaurs are so big and strong looking! I hope to be one someday!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <53>It must have been quite a chore to polish these fossils!<30><121>Oh! And they probably had to be really careful not to break anything!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <53>I bet some of these turned into fossils<6> while being out and about just like you are now!
HA Sp Museum_Fossil <214>They say if you find a new type of fossil, you'll get to name that dinosaur!<30><7>If I were to name one, it would be Super <41><963>-a-Saurus!<30><141>That's the perfect name for the strongest dinosaur, don't you think?
