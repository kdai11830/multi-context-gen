If you ever find any,<8><23> I'm sure the museum would appreciate it if you donated them.
OT Sp Museum_Fossil It's a good thing this museum is free to visit<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><561> Paying customers would probably be disappointed. <649>If only the people of <107> would donate more specimens<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>

OT Sp Museum_Fossil <28>So <8>do you have a museum in your hometown? <2289>How does it stack up to ours? <53>It's taken a little time, <8>but we've built a fairly impressive collection,<25><2289> if I don't say so myself.
OT Sp Museum_Fossil <40>This part of the museum is really coming along! <2289>Not that I can take any credit for it. <41><42>,<8> <103>I can't wait to see the last few specimens when they arrive!
