NPC Cafe Reset You again!<6> I've been seein' your face a whole lot lately!
NPC Cafe Reset When it comes to coffee,<8> I don't drink anything other than <375>Blue Mountain<375>!<671> That's it! For aroma,<8> richness,<8> and sweetness,<670> <18>there's nothing even close to better than Blue Mountain beans! <16>Er,<8> I mean we all have different tastes,<680> so I suppose I could see how you might like something else.
NPC Cafe Reset Adding milk to your coffee<670> <561>ends up spoiling its aroma and taste.<671> Coffee is best with <375>no<375> milk!<6> <16>Yeah, yeah,<8> I don't mean to say anything about how you drink your coffee.<680> Even though I already did.
NPC Cafe Reset Sugar in your coffee?<680> <375>No way<375>! You CRAZY?!<30><36>You use something like that,<8> you won't be able to taste the natural sweetness of your coffee! <16>All right,<8> maybe you're the kind that needs your coffee even sweeter.<680> To each 'is own, I suppose.
NPC Cafe Reset Nowadays,<670> <7>there are WAY too many grown-ups who do pretty much anything they're told to do! <561>Can you even imagine the chaos that occurs if a bunch of older guys start doin' stuff the young guys say? <16>There are times you gotta stick to your own beliefs,<670> even if you know you're in the wrong. <7>I wanna continue being that kind of opinionated old man people usually tend to avoid.<671> That's for me!
NPC Cafe Reset "<375>Mr. Resetti<375>,<8> <7>he's always angry and just yells at people...<30><16>"But that <375>Don Resetti<375>, he's always calm,<670> <18>peaceful,<8> and friendly to everybody he meets<8>.<8>.<8>." <16>That's probably what you think of us,<8> huh?<680> <38>But that ain't right!<30><945>My brother is very persistent when he gives his endless lectures!<30><16>Ever been lectured for two hours long? Yeah, even I'm not THAT bad!<30><36>In the end,<8> you'll probably forget why you were even being lectured in the first place! I'm just sayin', <561>ya shouldn't judge a book by its cover! And that goes DOUBLE for moles!
NPC Cafe Reset When a mole moves through the ground by diggin' a tunnel,<671> it's actually slower than a snail moving.<670> You ever heard that before?<670><30>I've never actually raced a snail to find out,<670> <561>so I don't know if it's true or not<8>.<8>.<8>. <7>But just think about it!<8> I'm diggin' a tunnel through DIRT and ROCKS, while the snail's just MOVIN'! <16>It's nonsense to compare us! Diggin' a hole wide enough <7>to pass through with a pickax is HARD!<8> <16>By the way,<8> I already dug a tunnel to your house,<8> so in case I need to,<8> <7>I can be there in an INSTANT!<6> I plan for every eventuality!
