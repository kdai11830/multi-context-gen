GE Ev Harvest <214>Today's the <375>Harvest Festival<375><619> <44>or as I like to call it, the FEASTival!<30><25>Everyone in town is gonna get a taste of my tasty home cooking!
GE Ev Harvest <31>Gosh, now the panic is starting to set in! I hope I have enough time to finish cooking my food!
GE Ev Harvest <36>Cooking is fun and all, but I thought it'd be a little easier than this!<1172> It's, like, a real skill, you know?
GE Ev Harvest <36>Ooh! I just realized I need to add some <834> to this dish I'm working on! Think you can get your hands on some, <439>? <18>I'll swap you for a different ingredient! <40>C'mon, do <77><46> a solid.
GE Ev Harvest Can you help <77><46> out? I need <77><834> and I thought <2192> <2192> <2192> <31>Don't make me beg!<796><797> Here you go! Sorry. I'm all out.
GE Ev Harvest <31>Eek! What am I gonna do? I need <77><834><354> or my dish will be absolutely ruined!<796><797> Heretake mine! Wish I could help you...
GE Ev Harvest <18>No hard feelings. I know it's not easy to get your hands on <77> <834>.
GE Ev Harvest <36>Boo! Well, if you come across any, I'll trade you for another ingredient. <44>I got your back, <439>!
GE Ev Harvest <36>Aw! Why did you have to get my hopes up like that, <42>?
GE Ev Harvest <36>Uh, thanks and all.<1172> <18>But what I really need to get my hands on is <77><834>.
GE Ev Harvest <40>Yay! You've made this <46> so happy. <214>Here. You can have my <834> in return!
GE Ev Harvest <214>All right! <8>Well, <616>I'd better get back to cooking now.
GE Ev Harvest <87>Since you helped me out, <214>I'll let you in on one of my cooking secrets...
GE Ev Harvest <40>So I heard about this from a friend of a friend of a friend, but it's, like, totally true. Cross my heart! Ready? <619><18><375>Lemons<375>. They're the secret weapon! <110>Just a squeeze of <375>lemon <375>juice and the flavors explode!
GE Ev Harvest <141>So I came up with this recipe one day when I was nomming on a yummers <1335>... I was, like, how much cooler would it be if you added <375>apple <375>pieces? <103>So much cooler. And crunchier!
GE Ev Harvest <367>OK, my friend made the yummiest <1335> in the whole world! <1172><38>I'm SO not exaggerating. <294>The secret<8>according to my friend, of course<8>is to add a drop of honey from a <375>beehive<375>! <72>Whoa, <70>! I just had a brilliant idea. <18>You should totally give that honey trick a try!
GE Ev Harvest <214>So, like, I've got this friend who's an awesome cook. <18>She made this delicious <1335>! <103>No jokeit was to die for! And you know what made it so yummers?<8> A touch of <375>vinegar<375>! Who knew? Hey! <23>Maybe you should give that a try, <70>!
GE Ev Harvest <214>So here's the trick to making the best <1335> ever! My friend taught me the secret... <13>But I think I can share it with you! <619><40>It's <375>butter<375>! Just a tiny little pat of butter! <36>Big secret, right? Anyhoo, you should totally try it out, <70>. <1172><44>I mean, it couldn't hurt, right?
GE Ev Harvest <40>So my friend taught me how to make killer <1335>. No jokeit's crazy good. <214>She said the secret to getting it all mild and yummy is <103><375>coconut<375>! Can you believe it? <18>But I can totally see how a little coconut would yum it up, right? <40>You should try it, <70>!
GE Ev Harvest <214>I hope there's enough room in my belly to take a taste of all of the food I'm cooking today!
GE Ev Harvest I am, like, utterly pooped from toiling away in a hot kitchen all day. <40>But it's worth it! One taste of this dish, and <25>I bet someone'll offer me my own cooking show! <319>I'll be a star!
GE Ev Harvest <214>Presentation is so important! <18>I gotta make sure my food looks as good as it tastes!
GE Ev Harvest <87>Thanks for swapping ingredients with me. My cooking was totally nom-nom worthy, <70>!
GE Ev Harvest <214>Thanks oodles of poodles for trading with me, <70>.<30><141>My cooking tastes even better than it normally does, all because of you. <669>Nom nom nom! <41><42>!

GE Ev Harvest <31>Cooking is tough! <619><44>I know I make it look easy and all. But that's just 'cause I know how to keep my cool! <214>Thanks for all of your help today, <70>. <18>Together we pulled off a successful <375>Harvest Festival<375>!
GE Ev Harvest <87>This <375>Harvest Festival <375>is all about the YUM. <214><375>Franklin <375>really set the bar high this time, huh?
GE Ev Harvest <87>This has been the absolute best <375>Harvest Festival <375>ever! <669>Food and food and food and more food!
GE Ev Harvest <214>The <375>Harvest Festival <375>is totally, like, one of the best days of the year. <141>There's just sooo much food! <36>But I'm kinda wondering why <375>Franklin <375>even bothered showing up<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <294>It's not like he cooked anything!
GE Ev Harvest <214>This has been a totally awesome <375>Harvest Festival<375>! <1172>My tummy is, like, completely stuffed. I'm a little sad that I can't fit any more food in there. <36>Is that crazy or what, <42>!
GE Ev Harvest <214>I'm totally gonna give <375>Franklin <375>a big ol' high five next time I see him. <367>He did such a good job! <294>I'm gonna force him to work in my kitchen making me more yummies! <110>Hahaha! Totally kidding about that.
GE Ev Harvest <214>It's been a nice <375>Harvest Festival<375> and all. But I'm kinda surprised <375>Franklin <375>didn't make a main dish! Unless<8>.<8>.<8>.<26>he DID make a main dish and I never got a bite of it! <561> But that would never happen...
GE Ev Harvest <53>Is it just me, or was <375>Franklin<375>'s meal a little light on the food this year?<30><219>Oh, but I'm not complaining. <40>I'm pretty sure I ate enough food to feed an army, <42>!
GE Ev Harvest <617>Oof! Mmm! My tummy is SOOOO full, it feels like it's about to burst!<30><44>Of course, I could always cram a little more dessert in there. There's always room for more dessert!
GE Ev Harvest <40>Now, that's what I call a successful <375>Harvest Festival<375>! Mmm! <619><212>I should cook more often, don't you think?
GE Ev Harvest <87>That was, like, the most awesome <375>Harvest Festival <375>ever! I think I ate my body weight in yumminess! Oof. Maybe I shouldn't dance with such a full tummy.<26> I think I'm gonna explode, <42>!
GE Ev Harvest <13>Mmm! That meal was way better than, like, dinner at the trendiest restaurant in the big city. <44>You must be <375>Franklin<375>'s secret weapon, <70>! <367>His food has never tasted so good, <42>!
GE Ev Harvest <617>I'm so stuffed I can barely move. <214>I guess that's the sure sign of a successful <375>Harvest Festival<375>! <103>And <375>Franklin<375>, like, totally didn't skimp on dessert this year. You've gotta have dessert, right?
GE Ev Harvest I'm literally so stuffed that I can't move a muscle. So full...but so worth it! <38>Hey, you helped <375>Franklin <375>cook up that amazing feast, didn't you? <103>I'm so jealous of you, <70>!
GE Ev Harvest <44>It sounds kinda fancy,<1172> but it's, like, the best. Just make your <375>oysters <375>with a squirt of <375>lemon <375>juice on top! <367>Deeeeelish, right? You've gotta try it sometime. It makes, like, all the difference.
GE Ev Harvest So get this... <8621><4785>Mushrooms <375>are totally yummers and all, but when you put 'em in a salad, it gets a little bland. <36>And who wants a bland salad? Not me, that's for sure!<30><18>That's why I always add a handful of <375>apple <375>pieces to my <375>mushroom salad<375>. <214>You should try it!
GE Ev Harvest <28>Did you know there's a kind of salad made almost entirely out of <375>fruit<375>? <214>Is that crazy or what? <367>Either way, <375>fruit salad<375> is delicious. Some people only add vinegar<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>but you need more than that! <25>The real secret is adding a bit of honey straight from the <375>beehive<375>! <214>It's the only way to go.
GE Ev Harvest <214>See, you can't just throw a bunch of stuff in a bowl and call it a salad. <8><38>Well, I mean, you can... <167>but you shouldn't! Especially when it comes to a <375>mixed salad<375>. <214>That recipe needs something special! <18>And here's the secret to a delicious <375>mixed salad<375><375>vinegar<375>! Crazy, right? <141>But it really brings out the flavor!
GE Ev Harvest <367>I totally adore <375>fish<375>. I completely adore salad. <8>Then why don't I adore <375>fish salad<375>? 'Cause of the fishy smell! <25>But I know how to get rid of that icky odor<375>lemon<375>! <619><26>Huh? You already knew about the lemon trick?
GE Ev Harvest <367>I never thought anything could make <375>mushroom bisque <375>more yummers than it already is. <72>But then I discovered <375>butter<375>. <8><18>Yup, just a little pat gives it that extra oomph, you know? <40>MMMMMM!
GE Ev Harvest <367>There's one thing that's, like, practically guaranteed to make me drool <909>shellfish chowder<375>! <617>Just saying it makes me dizzy with hunger! But you can't eat it plain. <38>That would be madness! <214>Nope, you've got to add a little pat of <375>butter<375>. <141>Just enough to give it some creaminess and depth. Yum!
GE Ev Harvest <44>I bet you think there's nothing you could possibly do to make <375>bouillabaisse <375>taste any better... <18>But if you add a squeeze of <375>lemon <375>juice right before serving, it'll really brighten the palate. <141>Deeeeelish!
GE Ev Harvest <214>I got this secret to delicious <375>fruit soup <375>from my favorite magazine, Healthy <45><46> Weekly. <103>You simmer a bunch of different fruits until they get all gooey and yummers. Doesn't that sound good? <40>But then you've got to add a little squeeze of <375>lemon<375>! That's the secret to bringing those flavors together!
GE Ev Harvest <214>If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that you've gotta take the sweet with the sour! <38>When it comes to cooking up a bowl of <375>tom yum kung<375>, you've already got the sour... <72>So you need to add a little sweet! <18>That's where a dash of <375>coconut <375>milk comes in handy. <214>Just think about itfresh lobster, a bit of <375>coconut<375><8><25>you can't get any tastier than that!
GE Ev Harvest Now, if you're cooking with <375>fish<375>, <18> you should definitely add a dash of <375>lemon <375>or <375>vinegar<375>. <44>But the trick is to only use ONE of thosenever both!

GE Ev Harvest Now, if you're cooking with <375>fish<375>, <18> you should sear it first and then add a dash of <375>lemon <375>or <375>vinegar<375>. <44>But the trick is to only use either <375>lemon <375>or <375>vinegar<375>never both!
GE Ev Harvest <214>Now, I bet you think I adore all things sweet, but that's not exactly true... When it comes to <375>fruit <375>pies, I hate all that syrupy, gooey sweetness.<30><72>But here's the perfect solution:<619> honey! Just a dab of honey from a <375>beehive <375>evens out the flavor. <367>That way, you get a dessert that's perfectly sweet and adorable<8>just like little ol' me!

GE Ev Harvest <214>I'm <77><46> who knows what she wants. <25>And what I want is a pie filled with <375>all sorts of<375> <375>fruits<375>! Of course, that can be a dangerous dish. <1172>Sometimes, too many fruits means too many flavors! <214>But if you add a squeeze of <375>lemon<375>, each flavor really stands out<8><319>just like me! Give it a try sometime!

GE Ev Harvest <72>Wait<619>if it's the <375>Harvest Festival<375>, does that mean I'll be able to snack on a bunch of yummy foods? <87>I sure hope it does! I love it when I get to spend the whole day going "nom nom nom!"
GE Ev Harvest <40>Like, wow! Everyone is holed up in their houses cooking up a storm. <669>Prepare for battle, chefs! <53>I wonder if they'll share any of their extra ingredients.<8825><8826><2192><2261><214> It'd be a shame to let food go to waste!
