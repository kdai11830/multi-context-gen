NPC Uomasa Fish All a dace needs <6><18>is a little salt and pepper and maybe a few minutes on the grill to get it just right.<680> <214>But I'm just gonna go ahead and eat this guy raw!<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish You know what carp are good for?<6> <18>Two simple words, my friend:<8> chilled sashimi. Oh, goodness yes.<680> <214>Not that I have time for that, of course!<8> Down the hatch it goes!<619> <87>YUUUUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Now for koi.<6> <18>I guess most people don't really eat 'em,<8> but they're real good in a nice stew.<680> <214>But I'm not most people, so I have no problem just eatin' them up. I'll even have 'em raw!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish You know, <6><18>I'm pretty good when it comes to scooping goldfish,<8> if I do say so myself. And I do.<680> <214>OK<671>.<671>.<671>.<670> Umm,<671> hey, close your eyes for a second or two, would ya?<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish Can't go wrong with freshwater goby, no, sir.<6> <18>Boil it, fry it... Doesn't matter!<8> Best in a soup, though.<680> <214>Or, <8>you know, <8>just eat 'em raw like I do! That's how real fishers do it!<619> <87>OH YES, YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish That reminds me. <6><18>Loach stew with veggies makes for a mean meal!<680> Er, assuming you eat your veggies. <214>I mean, <8>I'm just gonna go for raw myself!<8> You know me!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish If it's catfish we're talking about,<6> <18>you have to do tempura.<8> Have to. No way around that, no, sir. <680><214>I mean, <8>I'm just gonna go ahead and eat it raw, but you know... Oh well.<619> <87>Mmmm. YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Now an eel<6><18>you're gonna wanna<8> grill that guy, maybe with a bit of lemon and pepper for added flavor.<680> <214>But<8> raw does just as well<8> in a pinch! I mean, how often do you find yourself at a grill?<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Hey, listen. <6><18>I recommend frying giant snakehead<8> in peanut oil. Delish! You can't beat that idea!<680> <214>OK, well, me,<8> I'm just gonna scarf it down raw, of course! You still get the picture, though.<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Bluegills <6><18>are definitely the sort of fish you wanna deep fry. <8>No doubt! With some warm bread on the side...<680> <214>Or, <8>you know, <8>just slurp 'em down raw like I do. <619><87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish There's only one thing that beats fried yellow perch<6><18>fried yellow perch with pickles!<680> <214>But<8> you know, raw is good too. <8>I'm not picky!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Well, if you're curious, <6><18>black bass is really great fried,<8> but cook it up la meunire sometime! Tasty stuff!<680> <214>For me, <8>I'll just be eating this guy as is, if you get my drift.<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Well now, with pike, <6><18>frying works quite well.<8> But you'd also do good to turn 'em into fish sticks!<680> <214>Right now, though, I'll just snack on this guy as is, all natural!<619> <87>YUM and YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Ya know, with pond smelt,<6> <18>deep frying 'em is tasty. But grilling 'em up right is pretty good too!<680> <214>Not that I mind having this guy raw. Nope, not me! Happy to!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Know what? <6><18>Grilled sweetfish over a campfire is probably one of my absolute favorite things ever.<680> <214>Come to think of it, <8>raw sweetfish is one of my favorite things too!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Tell you what. <6><18>You can't beat cherry salmon fried up and salted, maybe with a dinner roll on the side.<680> <214>Not that I mind 'em raw either. <8>Anything goes when it comes to eating fish!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish I really can't think of anything that's better <18>than char fried up perfectly.<8> And the bigger the better, right?<680> <214>Still, eating 'em raw doesn't turn me off to them one bit!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Thing is, rainbow trout<6> <18>salted and grilled is golden, <680>but meunire works just as well in a pinch. <214>Oh, <8>and there's always raw. Can't go wrong with raw!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish For stringfish,<6> <18>saltin' and grillin' 'em works great.<680> And you know, fried or meunire ain't bad options either. <16>But <671><36>it'd be a bad idea to munch this guy right here.<15> <214>I mean, it IS a phantom fish<671>.<671>.<671>.
NPC Uomasa Fish Now for salmon,<6> <649>stew 'em, grill 'em, steam 'em, smoke 'em... <214>Doesn't really matter what you do. Tasty!<680> Though...the absolute best method<680> is to freeze and pickle 'em. Ever had pickled salmon? So good!<680> <214>Right now,<8> I'll just go ahead and scarf this guy down<8> raw!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Now with king salmon,<6> <18>you've got to saut it, <8>no question! I mean, how else could you really eat it?<680> <214>Well, there is raw, ya know... When you're pressed for time or just really hungry.<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish I like to eat my guppies in bunches!<6> <214>Pop 'em in 10 at a time!<680> <561>That's a big no go for amateurs, though.<680> <214>But do I look like an amateur? No, sir! <87>Down the hatch!
NPC Uomasa Fish Nibble fish.<6> <214>Those are fantastic if you know how to cook 'em!<680><26> But you gotta know what you're doing!<680> <38>A poorly cooked fish is just a sad thing to see. <214>Oh well.<670> <87>Down it goes!
NPC Uomasa Fish I've never tried it,<6> <18>but I'll bet dried angelfish tastes pretty close to jerky. Just a theory, of course. <214>Right now I'm just gonna eat it raw to save myself some time.<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Man, those neon tetras,<6> <214>I could eat these while juggling chainsaws.<680> <561>It's a bit risky for amateurs though.<680> <53>Come to think of it,<8> I have no idea why I'd want to juggle chainsaws while trying to eat<8>.<671>.<671>.<671> Oh well,<670> <87>down the hatch for you!

NPC Uomasa Fish By the by, my fisher friend, <6><18>frying gar is certainly the best way to eat it when it's lunch or dinnertime. <680><214>Though <8>it works pretty well if I <8>just swallow it whole too! No wrong way for fish!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish I wonder...<6> <18>How many people does a whole arapaima feed, anyway?<680> Just look at the size of it! <214>Heck, <670>even I can't down this in one go, even if I wanted to! Which I DO!

NPC Uomasa Fish I've heard clown fish<6> <18>go great grilled up with salt, but I've never had the chance to try them. <214>Maybe it's because I'm too quick to just munch 'em raw!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Surgeonfish, right?<6><561> It's got a real distinct stench to it, all stinky and so on. Assaults the nostrils!<680> <214>I-<8>I mean...<8>I'm still gonna eat it. Of course I am!<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish OK, with the blowfish...<6><649> Well they are tasty.<8> <26>But ONLY to an expert fish connoisseur like myself.

NPC Uomasa Fish Olive flounder<6><18>BOY, are they tasty!<680><30><214>In fact,<8> I'm just gonna go ahead and scarf this guy down right this very second! I can hardly wait!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish A great thing to try with a squid<18> is drying it overnight. Delicious, even with all those tentacles and suckers!<680> <214>Not that I have the patience to wait that long, of course. I'm getting the urge to snack!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Now, for your moray eels,<6> <649>grilling or tempura batter work well,<8> but for a real treat,<18> dry 'em overnight!<680> <214>Course,<8> you know me!<8> I don't have that kind of patience!<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish Tuna is great!<6> <649>Grilled, deep fried, <8>even pickled!<8> My favorite<18> has to be sushi, though. Yes, definitely.<680> <214>But <8>I'm perfectly happy eating this guy totally raw!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Of course, <6><561>blue marlin are a bit too big to grill in just one piece. Unless you're experienced like me.<680> <214>Well,<8> I think I'm just gonna tuck into this guy, no preparation needed! Behold my fish-eating skill!<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish When you're talking rays,<6> <18>stewing or deep frying is OK, but sashimi is totally where it's at!<680> <214>Of course, I'm just eating this fishy the way nature cooked him: RAW! Nyuk nyuk nyuk!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Let's see. The best way to cook an ocean sunfish<18> is definitely tempura.<8> Has to be! Tempura always works! <680><214>Heck, swallowing this guy in a single gulp is pretty much off the table, even for me. Bummer!
NPC Uomasa Fish <18>I like hammerhead sharks,<8> but I'll tell you,<8> eating 'em just isn't an option for ol' <375>Chip<375>. <214>Hmm.<8> Yup,<8> looks like this is a good example of "catch and release."<8> Except I can't give it back.<8> Nyuk!
NPC Uomasa Fish The thing about sharks is,<18> they just go really well either fried or dried! Nice and simple like that!<680> <214>Yeah, even I'm not gonna attempt to down this guy all at once! What do I look like, a whale?
NPC Uomasa Fish With saw sharks,<6> <18>a lot of folks like 'em for making fish cakes. Ever had 'em? They're cakes of fish!<680> <214>But even for me, this guy's too big to swallow whole. Maybe later!
NPC Uomasa Fish Hmm. I wonder,<6> <28>do whale sharks <8>taste much like regular sharks? Or are they a bit more blubbery?<680> <214>Obviously, even if I tried to eat this all in one biteand I did try once I couldn't do it! <561>Just not happening!
NPC Uomasa Fish Ooh, I hear bad things about oarfish.<6> People say they're too oily. <561>Nope, not very tasty at all! Bad news!<680> <16><36><8>So yeah, I guess I'd better not eat <15>it. I mean, it DOES make sense. <214>Oars are for paddlin', not eatin'!
NPC Uomasa Fish I hear coelacanths<6> <561>are too gross to even THINK about eating! I mean, these have got to be REALLY old.<680> <214>No, thank you. Even I'm not eating an ancient fish, no matter how big or rare it may actually be.

NPC Uomasa Fish When it comes to sea urchins,<6> <649>you can use 'em for sashimi or sushi, but whatever you do,<18> keep 'em raw!<680> <214>Me, <8>I like them fresh out of the water! Just watch for the spines, and you're good as gravy!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Acorn barnacles<18> are really tasty if you boil them in salt water or try to season and steam them. Ooh yeah! <214>As for me, I'll just be eating them whole! That's just my way!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Now, for oysters,<18> naturally you can go raw or grilled or even fried. It is ALL good, you know?<680> <214>Me, I'll always eat 'em whole, just like I did when I was a pup!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish Turban shells<6> <18>make great sashimi, but the best is when you grill them right there in their shells!<680> <214>You know me, though.<8> I'll just swallow them whole!<619> <87>YUM!

NPC Uomasa Fish Now with your clams,<18> you can stew 'em or grill 'em or steam 'em. Me, I'm a fan of a good chowder.<680> <214>But then again, I'm perfectly happy to just swallow them whole, shell and all! I'm tough like that!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish By the by<6>, <18>you can dry out the meat of a pearl oyster for quite a tasty meal. It's chewy!<680> <214>Not that I mind<8> just eating them whole like this!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish You know,<6> <649>scallops make for great sashimi, or maybe tempura...<8>or fried or sauted...<18> Tasty!<680> <214>I'm perfectly happy to just swallow them whole, of course!<619> <87>YUM!
NPC Uomasa Fish So I hear sea anemone<6> <18>goes really great in miso soup. Ever hear this? It's got a real crisp texture!<680> <214>But, you know,<670> I think I'll hold off on this guy. Don't quite have the stomach for it just yet.
NPC Uomasa Fish Now sea stars<6><561>people say you shouldn't eat these guys. Not tasty, apparently! Quite a harsh critique!<680> <214>Yeah, <670>I think I'll listen to common opinion just this once. I'm not quite crazy enough to eat a sea star!
NPC Uomasa Fish Man, <6><18>my hat goes off to whoever was the first to eat a sea cucumber! Sounds like a good idea, though...<680> <214>Yeah,<670> I don't think I'll be joining the sea-cuke club anytime today! Maybe not tomorrow either!
NPC Uomasa Fish From what my excellent sources tell me,<18> you CAN eat boiled sea slugs, though some are still poisonous.<680> <214>Yeah, I...<670>I don't think I'll chance it! Besides, who wants to eat a SLUG?
NPC Uomasa Fish So flatworms<671>.<671>.<671>.<6> <561>Bleck, we're most likely better off not eating these.<30><680><214>Yeah,<670> I think I'm really gonna pass!
NPC Uomasa Fish Mmm, mantis shrimp.<6> I'm totally up for these guys. <18>Deep fried or boiled, these little morsels are delicious.<680> <214>Of course, I'm not going to say no if they're served raw, either!<619> <87>YUM!
