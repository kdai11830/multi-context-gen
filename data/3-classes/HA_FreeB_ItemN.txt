HA FreeB ItemN <7>You dig with this shovel, and then you dig and dig and dig some more. <30><214>You get so tired, but that's when <639> tastes so great!<30><7>And then you fill in the hole and fill it in some more.<30><214>And you get so tired again, but that's when <639> tastes great again, <8><42>!
HA FreeB ItemN Old dudes at construction sites are the coolest, aren't they?<30><367>The kind of manual labor they do<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> It makes my muscles tingle just thinking about it! <25>So I'm kind of copying them and walking around with this shovel. Suits me, huh?
HA FreeB ItemN <87>Yeah! I'm going to catch some giant bugs with this thing!<30>I wonder if I'll see any that are twice as big as you.<30>Come to think of it,<15><26> this net might not cut it!<30><31>Oh, man! I need a bigger net! <8><41><42>!
HA FreeB ItemN If you hold your net just like so, the bugs will fly right into it!<30><110>Well, maybe not. But sometimes you get lucky! Haha!<15><13>

HA FreeB ItemN <214>As you can see, today I'm a real man of the sea!<30><26>What?! Aqua Bro?!<619> <7>That's kind of a weird thing to say. <15><287>I'm just trying to go fishing, <1379><1380>#x0;o<1381>#x0;a<2467>#x0;!
HA FreeB ItemN <18>This watering can filled to the brim with water is actually quite heavy!<30><214>I'm carrying it around more for strength training than for nurturing flowers. Seriously.
HA FreeB ItemN <214>I'm going to run around town and water all the plants!<30><294>I'm gonna grow 'em super big and turn this town into a gigantic jungle! <8><41><42>!<30>What's with that suspicious smile?<15> <87>Don't you wanna have some jungle adventures?
HA FreeB ItemN I think walking around in the rain is really cool.<619><50> But I don't want to catch a cold! <53>Do I look cool, or do I stay healthy?<15> <31>I can't decide, <8><42>!
HA FreeB ItemN <25>It might not look like it, but my umbrella weighs 200 pounds!<30><110>Ha ha! I can do strength training even when it's raining!<15><13>
HA FreeB ItemN <649>Yesterday I was dancing to the rhythm of <1820> while eating <117>. <28>Do you think I accidentally created a rain dance?<15><31> Is this rain my fault?
