ZK FreeF MidSummer On the <375>Summer Solstice<375>,<2289> we're treated to both the longest day and the shortest night of the year. Wild! After today,<39318>#xE;<2289> are supposed to come<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <44>Are you ready for them yet,<2289> <70>?
ZK FreeF MidSummer <8>.<8>.<8>.<8>You're asking me <28>why the sun won't set today?<30><38>I don't know! <2289>Maybe the sun is just jealous of my good looks?<20879> <40>Hah ha!
ZK FreeF MidSummer <7><41><107> isn't sleeping at all today, even if it wants to<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><219>So<8> if you're having a hard time sleeping at any point,<2289> you should come over to my place!<2289> <87>Ooh! We can sit around and talk about who has cooties and who we think is cool!<8> <41><42>!
ZK FreeF MidSummer <7>Having the sun out for so long almost makes me feel like we're in a dream<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <38>That means we can do whatever we want to, right?<20879> <40>Hah ha!<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>Uh, <16>I can't really think of anything crazy to do. <38>Does that make me kinda boring?<53>
ZK FreeF MidSummer <87>Listen, <70>!<2289> I came up with a special message,<8> <42>!<30><7>You<8>.<8>.<8>.<20879>are my sun that never sets!<30><13>What do you think? Pretty good, isn't it?<39322><2289>But problem is, my clever, poetic statement only really works today because of the <375>Summer Solstice<375><8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <31>Gah! I've gotta hurry then! I've got a lot of girls to talk to and no time to do it!
