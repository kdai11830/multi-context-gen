GE Sp Museum_Fish <13>It's so quiet and dim in here.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> <294>It's the perfect place to eavesdrop, <42>!
GE Sp Museum_Fish This place is nice and cool. <945>I should come here whenever I get a crazy fever!
GE Sp Museum_Fish I hope the museum gets more fish for this exhibit. <36>It's a little empty in here right now.
