OT Q06 A_Req <219>Can I ask you to help me with a little surprise, <70>?<30><13>I bought <48> a gift, and now I need it delivered, <42>.<6> Would you mind helping?
OT Q06 A_Req <219>I got into a big argument with <33684> I can't even remember what it was about.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> <36>Hmm. Something about whether <117><33687><1540> is a legitimate sport or not. Anyway, I think I was a little mean about the whole thing, so I got a gift for <48> to say I'm sorry. <13>Would you mind delivering it for me, <70>?
OT Q06 A_Req <219>So I borrowed something from <48> I should have returned long ago, <42>. <13>I wonder, <70>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>would you mind returning it for me? I'm a little too busy to take it over myself.
OT Q06 A_Req <219>I hate to ask you for a favor, <70>, but could you please run a delivery for me? <13>You see, I found something that <33688> Would you mind returning it, <42>?
OT Q06 A_Req Oh, <8>I bet you can help me with a serious problem. A package was delivered to my house. But it's not mine! It was supposed to be delivered to <33693> Everyone will say I took it from <48>'s mailbox!<6> You KNOW how people talk! Will you please return it for me,<8> <70>?
OT Q06 A_Req <219>Well, <48> asked me to get something, so I went out and bought it, <8><42>. <36><48> asked me to keep it all hush hush,<8> so I'm worried that if I deliver it, <8>everyone will see! <13>Can you take it to <48> for me, <70>?<2289> Oh,<8> and be very discreet about the whole thing.
OT Q06 A_Req <13>Thanks for helping! Here it is, <70>.
OT Q06 A_Req <13>That's great! This gift should patch things up between us.
OT Q06 A_Req <13>Thanks for helping out, <70>. I'll just turn this over to you then.
OT Q06 A_Req <13>Thanks, <70>. I'll just give this to you then!
OT Q06 A_Req <13>Thank you very much. You don't know how much I appreciate this. Well, here it is.
OT Q06 A_Req <13>Here it is, <70>. Thanks for all your help.
OT Q06 A_Req <219>Oh, and one more thing.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Deliver it before the end of the day, OK?
OT Q06 A_Req <219>Oh, and this is urgent, but you can do it tomorrow. No later than that, though, OK?
OT Q06 A_Req <219>Oh, I just realized it's not really a good hour for making deliveries, is it? <18>You should probably wait until morning, <70>.
OT Q06 A_Req What, you won't deliver it?<6> <36>I guess I'll do it myself then.<6> Thanks anyway, <42>.
OT Q06 A_Req What? You won't help out?<6> <36>I guess I'll just have to face this myself then, <42>.
OT Q06 A_Req What, <8>you won't deliver it?<6> <36>I suppose I'll just have to do it myself.<6> Well,<8> thanks anyway.
OT Q06 A_Req What, you won't help? <6><36>Hmm. I guess I'll do it then. <6>Really, I suppose I should anyway, <42>.
OT Q06 A_Req What? You won't help me?<6> Ugh, this is all <375>Pete<375>'s fault anyway. I shouldn't drag you into this. <36>Never mind. I'll just take care of this mess myself.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>somehow.
OT Q06 A_Req What? You won't deliver it?<6> <36>Hmm. I'll just do it myself then. Thanks anyway, <70>.
