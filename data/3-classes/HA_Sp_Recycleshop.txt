HA Sp Recycleshop <31>What?! I came all the way over here, but there's nothing left!
HA Sp Recycleshop What a bummer! I didn't expect that everything would be gone<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
HA Sp Recycleshop Ugh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I guess I'll have to wait until more items come in.
HA Sp Recycleshop <87>All right! This is the last item. Guess I gotta have it!
HA Sp Recycleshop The last one, huh?<6> <31>The last item in stock always gets my attention!
HA Sp Recycleshop <110>So basically this is the only option left, right? <8><41><42>.
HA Sp Recycleshop There aren't a lot of items here.<15> Maybe the good stuff sold right away?<30>Man, I should've come here sooner! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <7>I gotta observe everything carefully to find a good bargain!
HA Sp Recycleshop <87>Sometimes there are items here that can't be found at other shops. That's why I can't quit stopping by!
HA Sp Recycleshop <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> There are too many items! I can't make up my mind!
HA Sp Recycleshop <53>That one<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Or maybe this one<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <31>Gaaah! It's hard to make a decision!
HA Sp Recycleshop I'm the type of guy who can't decide things right away.<30><128>All right! It's time for me to pick one now. Here we go!
HA Sp Recycleshop <87>I always get curious and come here to check if there are new items. <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <53>A recycled item is one that used to belong to somebody else, right?<30><110>Ha ha! I can make full use of something that the previous owner couldn't figure out,<8> <42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop Are you buying today? Or maybe selling?<30><53>Those eyes<8>.<8>.<8>.<619> <26>Don't tell me you're here just to look around!
HA Sp Recycleshop <28>Are you looking for anything in particular?<15><40> I never know what I'm looking for until I see it.
HA Sp Recycleshop <40>I bought it! Woohoo! It feels really good when you buy something nice!
HA Sp Recycleshop <7>When you decide something, you gotta act quick! Keep that in mind!
HA Sp Recycleshop <7>Purchasing something is like having a battle with the store clerk!<8> <41><42>!<30><26>Wait a minute.<15> If I gave them my money, does that mean I lost?
HA Sp Recycleshop <669>Alrighty! I bought something pretty cool!<8> <41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop So. Your <834>? <15><214>Nice!<30><87>Should I be in a buying mood or not?<796><1099> Yeah, you should! No, you shouldn't.
HA Sp Recycleshop I'm intrigued by your <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<619> <121>This sale price, though!<30><28>Be honest with me. Should I buy?<796><1099> Of course! No way!
HA Sp Recycleshop I'm deciding whether I should buy your old <834>! Be honest. Should I?<796><1099> Yes! Buy, buy, buy! Don't do it!
HA Sp Recycleshop Oh. OK. If you say so, I won't do it!
HA Sp Recycleshop <214>Ah, OK! If you say so, I'll definitely go for it!
HA Sp Recycleshop <87>I see! You'd recommend buying, huh?<6> Well, I'm gonna do it then!<8> <41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop Excuse me! I'd like to buy this item!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><23><1152>Oh, that's right!<15><214> You're here, so I'm just gonna pay you directly!
HA Sp Recycleshop Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <41><834><8>.<8>.<8>.<6> But at this price?<619> What should I do?<796><1099> Treat yourself! Forget it!
HA Sp Recycleshop Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <41><834>? A bit expensive!<30><16>But I wonder if the price indicates rarity?<796><1099> Yeah! Better buy now! No. Don't buy now.
HA Sp Recycleshop <214>I wasn't planning on buying the <834>, but now I think I have to,<8> <42>.<30><28>What would you do if you were in my shoes?<796><1099> I'd treat myself! I'd turn and run.
HA Sp Recycleshop <18>You're right! It's never smart to waste money!
HA Sp Recycleshop <53>Well, I could spend the <375>Bells<375>, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Hmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <6>Nah, I'll pass!
HA Sp Recycleshop Yeah, but I still think the price is too high. I'm gonna have to pass for now. <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <8>.<8>.<8>.<8><354>Too pricey!<619> I'm gonna be manly and say a firm no right now.
HA Sp Recycleshop <18>Yup! I might not get another chance to buy this later, so I'll take the plunge now!
HA Sp Recycleshop <7>Alrighty! It's time to be a real man and buy with no hesitation!
HA Sp Recycleshop <616>All right!<6><18> You gave me the last push,<8> so I'm gonna do it!
HA Sp Recycleshop <26>Whoa! This item is really cheap, isn't it?!<30><16>Hey, <70>, are you sure you wanna sell it for this price?<796><1099> Yup, you should buy it! Don't buy it.
HA Sp Recycleshop Oh? OK, I won't buy this item then.<8> <41><42>.
HA Sp Recycleshop <214>Wow! I'm so lucky to find this item so cheap!<6><30><16>At least, that's my first impression.<15> But to be honest, I just want it because it's a bargain!<30>It's actually not something I would normally like.<8> <41><42>.
HA Sp Recycleshop <87>Whoa! How lucky am I? I'm ready to buy right away then!
HA Sp Recycleshop <121>Whaaat<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>?<6> Wow. Expensive <834>, right? Some recycled items are pricey!
HA Sp Recycleshop <121>Whoa! That is cheap! <41><834>? Only <375><863> Bells<375>?!<30><50>And yet<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Still too much for me.
HA Sp Recycleshop I don't think I can resist their <834>. So tempting! <6><214>What should I do?<796><1099> Go for it! Forget it!
HA Sp Recycleshop Oh, you think so?<619> Well, if you say so, maybe I should listen to you.
HA Sp Recycleshop <18>Yup, yup! It's all about having that momentum to make decisions!
HA Sp Recycleshop <26>Wow! This item is incredibly cheap!<619> <28>Can I really buy it for this price?<796><1099> Yeah, buy it! No, don't buy it.
HA Sp Recycleshop <110>Oh, man. I didn't know you were eyeing this item too! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <53>Maybe I don't need this item.<30><31>Sometimes I surprise myself. I almost fell for the cheap price! That was close. Too close!
HA Sp Recycleshop <214>Thank you! There's nothing to hold me back, so I'm taking this item!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><87>Man!<6> This was such a great deal! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><141>I'm glad I bought something nice today!<6> Thanks for your advice!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><110>Ha ha!<6> It's not every day someone gets so lucky!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><141>Ahh!<6> I'm very satisfied! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><87>All right!<6> Thanks to you, I made a good purchase today!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Mm-hm! Not a bad deal!
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><214>Today I spent more money than I usually spend.
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><50>I better not look inside my wallet. It's pretty empty right now.
HA Sp Recycleshop <4><69><6><18>I should be fine if I only drop money like this every once in a while!
