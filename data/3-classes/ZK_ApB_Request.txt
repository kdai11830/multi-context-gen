ZK ApB Request <53>So I was thinking.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><107> really needs a <375>police station<375>.<30><16>Yeah, for sure. It would have a lost and found... Who wouldn't want to find lost stuff? <7>You know what else? The police would keep tabs on suspicious characters they see in town! Wait. Hold on. I'm a bit suspicious, aren't I? <38>Oh, maybe this isn't such a good idea. <16>Anyway, you're the mayor, so look into it, OK?<813>
ZK ApB Request <53>Hey, I've been thinking.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><18>we really need to spice up <107>.<30><7>I know exactly what would do it. We need <77><814>.<30><13>You're the mayor, so give it some thought. But take it from me.<1172> <616>We need the spice, <42>!<813>
ZK ApB Request <53>So, Mayor, I've been thinking.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Here's an idea for how to make <107> better. <7>And it's free of charge! Yeah, what we definitely need around here is <77><814>. <649>Just imagine it. Everyone would know how much better <107> is than anywhere else. <13>I'll fill in <375>Isabelle<375>, and you can get right on that, Mayor. <1172>I'd really appreciate it.<813>
ZK ApB Request <7>I had this intense dream that <77> <814> fell out of the sky and landed in <107>. <669>And <789> thought it was the most amazing thing that ever happened to our town! So, Mayor, are you going to make our dreams come true? It's all up to you, <70>!<813>
ZK ApB Request <7>I've been thinking about something. Whatever happened with that campaign promise of yours? You said that if we voted you in as mayor, you'd get our town <77><814>. <53>Oh, now I remember. <1172>There wasn't any campaign. <1172>Or vote. <1172>We sort of forced you to be mayor, right? <13>Uh, then out of the kindness of your loving heart, would you please get us <77><814><18870><813>
ZK ApB Request <7>So I've got a complaint about <107>. You're the mayor, so I'd like to make this official. I've realized that we don't have <77><814>, and we should get one right away. <26>Wait! <1172>If I'm making this official, I should tell <375>Isabelle<375>! <13>Sorry, Mayor.<1172> But think about it, OK?<813>
