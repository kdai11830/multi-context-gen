ZK FreeF Newyear We rodents get a pretty bad rap for being "disease-ridden little balls of gnarly hate."<8> <128>I hate it! <287>I'm not a bad guy!<8> I wash regularly, get my shots, pay my loans, even say hello in a friendly way! Oh well.<6> <18>At least people are talking about me.<8> <40>Better than not talking about me at all,<8> so happy new year!
ZK FreeF Newyear <214>The calendar shifts to a new year, but I'm not content to just sit around and wait for the next one. <40>Nope!<8> This year,<8> <18>I'm finally going to figure out how to speed time along! <87>Then we get right back to holidays! <53>Shouldn't be too difficult, really.<8> I mean,<8> <25>I'm a strong guy,<8> and time seems pretty flimsy. <294>One good punch should solve that whole "space-time continuum" problem right up! <38>Then once we bovines control time, <110>maybe someone ELSE will have to handle the milk supply! <13>So<8> that's just a little snippet from my graphic novel.<8> <18>It's still in the rough stages.
ZK FreeF Newyear <25>Tigers are awesome.<8> I don't even want to argue this fact with you, because I don't feel the need. Plus,<8> <294>we tigers have a bad habit of losing our cool when backed in a corner, and you don't want that. I once had a guy come to my door trying to sell me some magazine subscriptions. <36>I kept saying no, but he just wasn't listening,<8> just repeating, <7><1068>"no, really, you want some magazines."<3505> <561>Well, I was having none of that,<8> <128>so I unleashed the tiger!<8> <25>Yup, just closed the door right in his face. I felt bad afterward,<8> so I bought 37 subscriptions,<8> but, man,<8> <36>I really hated my outburst of insanity.
ZK FreeF Newyear <214>I love New Year's, but my parents inevitably sent me another huge batch of carrots. <354>They just keep watching the news every night and get fed the same old carrot agenda, which is sad. <31>Rabbits need more than carrots!<8> <7>Everyone assumes otherwise, but it's the truth!<2289> <36>Oh well.<8> Food's food.
ZK FreeF Newyear <7>Look,<8> <70>!<20879> This year<2289> I'm gonna keep running until I can't run anymore! <87>After all,<2289> what better time than the present?<20879> <214>No one's gonna stable this horse! <40>Hah ha!
ZK FreeF Newyear <7>Finally<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I think sheep will really take the spotlight this year<8>.<8>.<8>.<619> <38>Maybe it's just a hunch. <13>But then again, it makes a ton of sense. Everyone loves sheep! <319>About time we got credit!
ZK FreeF Newyear <87>The new year makes me want to dance until I pass out<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><7>but that's never enough for people! <7>They just assume us monkeys are always ready to perform,<8> <561>but we're not!<8> We need rest like anyone else! <36>Sure,<8> if I had anything left in the tank, I'd keep going,<8> <31>but these monkey feet have limits!
ZK FreeF Newyear <7>You see this face?<8> <669>This will be the face you associate with <1226>! <294>And why is that, you may ask? <40>How could you NOT?! <44>Look at the perfect angles!<8> <13>The blemish-free skin!<8> <25>The powerful features! <319>I'm the complete package!
ZK FreeF Newyear <214>The year's just begun, and already I have an insatiable urge to <105>wag my tail like it's nobody's business! <13>I have a good feeling about what's right around the corner, <70>! <294>Look out, world!<8> <319><963> is here!
ZK FreeF Newyear <8><28>You looking forward to your New Year's dream,<8> <70>?<30><16>The very next dream you have after the new year is supposed to be really important, you know<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <26>What, me?<20879> <13>I'm always dreaming,<20879> <44>even when I'm wide awake<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK FreeF Newyear Oh boy, I get so anxious when a new year starts. <38>It's fun, but there's so much I have to get done! <13>And when I say that, <40>I really mean there's a lot I need your help to do. <616>You know how it works!
ZK FreeF Newyear <8>.<8>.<8>.<8><28>My New Year's resolution?<30><53><2289>Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> I thought about it a lot, <13>and what I want to do most this year<20879> <319>is dance,<8> <42>!
ZK FreeF Newyear <214>They often say you gotta eat something really fancy and cultural for New Year's<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <38>But I sort of just feel like eating a juicy <107> <1622>!<6> <669>Woo!<8> Hometown pride!
ZK FreeF Newyear <13>There's so much we get to do during New Year's.<30><141>Everything's a first when you do it today! <72>That's what makes the new year so much fun! <53><2289>Now, what should I do first for the new year? Maybe I should write a blog? But what would I title it<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<686>
ZK FreeF Newyear <44><41><963>: The Hero of Time.<20879> Hmm.<8> Doesn't sound right<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK FreeF Newyear <44>Between <41><963> and a Hard Place.<4115>#x0;<3142>Hmm.<8> Not quite<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK FreeF Newyear <44><41><963> and the New Year.<20879> No,<8> that's not it<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
