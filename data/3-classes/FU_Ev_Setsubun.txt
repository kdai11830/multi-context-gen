FU Ev Setsubun <31>Eek! <6>It's an o<8>-ogre!
FU Ev Setsubun <26>What?!<6> An ogre?!
FU Ev Setsubun <167>An ogre?!
FU Ev Setsubun Be gone,<8> ogre!<15><669> Out with your bad luck,<8> and in with good fortune!
FU Ev Setsubun <214>Hee hee.<6> Throwing my own beans really makes it feel like <375>Bean Day<375>.<6> Thanks for helping,<8> bad ogre!
FU Ev Setsubun <18>You can't have <375>Bean Day<375> without the beans!<619><38> I didn't hit you in the eye or anything, did I?
FU Ev Setsubun <53>It seems like a shame to throw out perfectly good beans.<15> <13>Still, it's an important part of the tradition!
FU Ev Setsubun <28>Wait<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> You're an ogre,<8> but you're carrying beans.<30>Do I still throw my beans at you?<6> Are you carrying fake beans?<31> I'm not sure how to proceed.<15><16>
FU Ev Setsubun <28>What's this?<6> You're an ogre,<8> but you want to throw beans?<30><214>Oh!<6> I suppose it is a lot of fun.<6> I'm sorryI never realized ogres might enjoy it too!
FU Ev Setsubun <72>Really?<6> An ogre carrying beans?<6> <13>I've never met an ogre who does that.<6> You must be very avant-garde.
FU Ev Setsubun <214>Today is <375>Bean Day<375>,<8> so don't forget to stock up on beans!<6> You'll need them in case you run into any ogres.
FU Ev Setsubun <214>I've got a pocket full of beans in case I run into any ogres today!
FU Ev Setsubun <214>Don't forget that today is <375>Bean Day<375>!<6> If you don't throw any beans, you could have an unlucky year!
FU Ev Setsubun <214>It's nice that you have beans for throwing.<6> I like to make a hearty soup with my leftover beans.
FU Ev Setsubun <214>Oh,<8> a bean thrower!<6> Thank you for helping to control the town's ogre population.
FU Ev Setsubun <13>Are those beans for <375>Bean Day<375>?<6> I'm glad you're participating in our traditions.<6> You're a great sport!
FU Ev Setsubun <13>Hooray for us,<8> the bean-throwing squad!<6> Let's do our best to banish bad luck and bring in good luck!
FU Ev Setsubun <13>I see someone else has beans for <375>Bean Day<375>!<6><18> It's up to us to make sure this town is lucky all year long.
FU Ev Setsubun <214>Hello,<8> fellow bean enthusiast!<6> Are you ready to banish bad luck from our lovely town?
FU Ev Setsubun <28>Are you trying to escape having beans thrown at you?<30>Well,<8> I can't let you stay too long,<8> but you can have some tea.<6> Then you should leave town, please!
FU Ev Setsubun <13>As a guest in my home,<8> it would be rude to chase you out.<6> We'll resume our bean-throwing tradition outside.
FU Ev Setsubun <13>I suppose it wouldn't be <375>Bean Day<375> without you ogres.<6> Rest here for a few minutes.<8> Then it's back outside!
