OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <214>I'm not surprised that <48> has <77><834> in her house. <25>A classy lady deserves a classy piece of art like that.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <141>Ahhh<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>breathe in that fresh air.<2289> It's all thanks to <48>'s <834>. <53><41><42>, <8>I should get one of these for my place.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <26>I didn't know that <48> plays the <834>!<30><110>She's probably secretly in a <1820> band.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <53>Hmm.<8> So <48> has <77> <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>and it's nicer than mine. <128>This will not stand.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <18>This is exactly the sort of <834> the doctor prescribed for me. <7>"Adult Falling Out of Bed Syndrome" is a real and serious disorder, <8>and I will thank you not to make fun!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <38>This must be where <48> sits when she's up late working on her "material." Poor girl always works so hard to be clever. <2289>At least it's a nice <834>.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <294>Oh, look.<8> It's <48>'s <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><110>If you ever want a comprehensive summary of what was in style last season,<8> just take a peek in there.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <53>I feel like I've seen <48> wearing her <834> a lot lately. <44>I guess it's just convenient to keep her favorite outfit on display like this.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <13>Looks like <48> is reading <2058>.<30><38>That's funny<8>I thought she WROTE that book.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <167><48> uses <77> <834><32574><2289><44>Maybe she has some kind of animated broom that does all the work for her<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot Hey, <70>, <8><28>did you see <48>'s <834>? <110>She probably just likes to keep something around that's older than she is. <2289><41><42>!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <72>Now this is some real,<8> old-fashioned hospitality.<87> <21193>#xE;<48> set out her <834> for us. <110>Even though she didn't know we were going to be here snooping through her things!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot Oh, <8>look. <21193>#xE;<48> has <77> <834><12600><2289>And she left a document open<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <167>It's just a page with "<42>" typed over and over again. <15><31>Let's get out of here,<8> <70>!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <141>Aww,<8> <48> is such a good host. <2289>See? <8>She left out <77> <834> for us. <38>And she didn't even know we were coming over!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <31>I'm hungry.<8> Do you think <48> would mind if we took a peek inside her <834>? <561>On second thought, <8>it's probably filled with <33> and ketchup.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <44>Confirmed: <21193>#xE;<48> has <77> <834> in her room.<30><53>I would make fun of her, <8>but<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><87>it's too soft and cuddly!<2289> I just want to squeeze it! <2289>Now I need one.

OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot Oh, <48>. I read the same news "report" in the <41><107> Enquirer.<30>But sadly, <8>it turns out that owning <77><834> will not actually make you any younger.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <53>I<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I think I get it. <2289><72><48> has this <834> on display to be ironic. <103>Bravo,<8> <4152><2289> It's trs avant-garde!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <128>I can't believe there's <77><834> here and nobody told me! <248>I would have been so much nicer to <48><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <32205>
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <18>I knew <48> would have one of these for some reason. <2289><25>And that reason is that I'm partially psychic.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <18>I could see myself living here.<2289><121> <48>'s style isn't as different from mine as you might expect.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <53>I'm not sure <48> would appreciate us going through her stuff. Then again,<36> <8><72>maybe she would. <2289><110>I guess we'll never know unless we try.
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <649>I always imagined that <48>'s place would smell like <33>. <26>But it actually smells kind of like <117><32264><2289><38>The more you know!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot <44>Less talk, <8>more snooping!
OT FreeC Furniture_Ot Knowing <48>, each and every decorating choice in here was carefully weighed and deliberate. <38>I wonder what she'll do if I tilt one of her decorations just a few degrees<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
