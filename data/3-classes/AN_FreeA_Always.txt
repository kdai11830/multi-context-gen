AN FreeA Always <13>So listen to this!<6> The other day I went to a spa with a friend from back home! <774><686>
AN FreeA Always <18>You ever have those nights when you just can't sleep?<15> <44>At times like that<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>you know what to do! <1479>
AN FreeA Always <72>This has nothing to do with anything, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><214>I love potatoes!<15> I could eat 'em every day! <28>How do you like your taters?<1480><452><235><1481><1482> Baked! Mashed! French fried! I can't decide! Potatoes are yucky!
AN FreeA Always <26>Hey! <6>This is kinda out of the blue, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><16>do you ever do any cooking?<775>%<525> I sure do! All the time! None that ended well.
AN FreeA Always The other day<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><704> asked me for a secret meeting behind the town hall! <1485>#x0;.
AN FreeA Always <53>I just recently realized this, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I kind of have a thing for telling fortunes and guessing the future. <732>678
AN FreeA Always :<372>=
AN FreeA Always <1489>
AN FreeA Always <18>I wanna talk to you, <70><8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Do you think you can make it so you never lose a fight?<6> 'Cause you can. <44>Let me break it down for you<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> MN<1491>#x0;Q
AN FreeA Always <13>Oh yeah!<6> I went back home the other day, and I found my diary from when I was a kid! <16>It had a lot of real interesting stuff in it!<6> I was kind of a strange kid<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><1493><1494>
AN FreeA Always <26>Did you hear the news?<30><16>If you want to enjoy <375>Halloween<375> to the fullest, you gotta make sure to have a certain item or two ready! <44>Your hint is<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><375>1,031<375>!<30><87>If you feel up to it, look for headwear that costs <375>1,031<375><375> Bells<375> in <375>Labelle<375>'s shop!
AN FreeA Always <18>They had this pool with a table- tennis table floating in it! So we just had to try it out! <15><44>It was crazy! <87>Whoever came up with the idea of pool table-tennis is a total genius! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <18>It was like being on an overnight school field trip<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><44> We even had a knock-down, drag-out pillow fight! <16>I don't think I've ever been in an organized pillow-fight tournament before.<15> I didn't know they existed! <214>But it was more fun than I thought!<6> <18>You really should try it sometime!<6> Start training now! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <16>I've said it before,<6> <44>but whoever thought of a hot tub is a genius!<30><18>I love it, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>my noggin always gets cold when I'm tubbin'!<30><214>Someone should invent a bubbly, warm-water hat you could wear while you're soaking! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <18>For dinner there was this serving tray as big as a coffee table<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><214> We got crazy excited when we saw it! <87>A tray that big full of <117>? That'd be so cool to see! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <87>The owner of the place was a super-nice lady!<6> I was really able to kick back and relax! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <23>A piping-hot bowl of oatmeal will get you snoozing!<15><16> It's a perfect midnight snack! <13>You get the oats all fluffy and hot<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> and put some milk in there too!<30><87>It'll make your tummy all warm and toasty!<6> And you'll sleep like a little oatmeal-loving baby! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <23>You need some sandwich magic!<15> <16>Try whipping one up for a snack!<30><18>I prefer to not put anything in it.<8> I just butter the bread!<30><13>Eat that, and you'll feel nice and full<6> and sleep till morning!
AN FreeA Always <40>Watch some late-night TV!<15> It's terrible, and it'll put you right into a sleepy mood!<16> <7>Just be careful not to catch that occasional good movie, or you'll get drawn in and stay up all night!
AN FreeA Always <23>Deep breathing can really help.<16><15> <18>Take a few deep breaths to calm down and get all sleepy, <6><42>!
AN FreeA Always <23>Try a carrot as a midnight snack!<16><30><87>Peel it real nice, and crunch it up nice and slow. Let the day's stress roll off as you crunch!<30><18>It'll fill you up, and you'll sleep clean on till morning, <6><42>!
AN FreeA Always <31>Oh! <8>Yeah, I hear ya!<6> And you gotta top it off with the ultimate dynamic duo of cheese and chives!<15><16> <13>Yeah, I knew you'd be on Team Baked Potato with me!
AN FreeA Always <31>Oh my gosh! They're so good that way!<15> I like to do a little taterscaping and make a path for a gravy river!<6><16> <18>Pour it on, and let that gravy river just gush over the gravyfall and flood the mashed-potato plains!<6><13>
AN FreeA Always <40>Boom! <8>French fries! <6>Yes!<15><16> I can really go to town on french fries.<6> I pretty much inhale 'em! <13>Ever tried 'em with a little sea salt and vinegar? Get that salty-tangy thing going?<8> Yum-diddly-um, dude!
AN FreeA Always <8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>I know, right?!<6> I feel like potatoes are the superheroes of food!<8> They can do anything! <18>They leap over fruit and fly faster than other vegetables!<6><13> They can team up with sweet and spicy stuff!<6> <7>And they can stand alone against the injustices of broccoli and cauliflower!<6> I salute you, potatoes!
AN FreeA Always <50>Th-<8>that's ridiculous<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><619> <31>How can you not like potatoes?!<6> Have you ever even had a potato?!<15> <334>Maaaan<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> If I were a wizard, I'd turn you into a giant potato!
AN FreeA Always "#
AN FreeA Always <87>I bet I could eat potatoes all day every day, <6><42>!
AN FreeA Always <16>Ahh!<15> <13>I want some potatoes right now!<15><87> I'm going to go have some delivered! <26>Oh!<6> It would be so cool to live in a big potato house! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <1501>
AN FreeA Always <72>Attaboy!<15><18> Cooking takes more skill and strength than people think!<30><36>Me<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I always get called back home around the holidays to be the hero of feast preparation, <6><42>!
AN FreeA Always <72>Ooh!<6> Good for you!<15><16> I always get called home around the holidays to help out with feast preparations. <36>They all tease me about how girly I am in the kitchen<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <1503>
AN FreeA Always <26>Huh! <6>Really?<15><53> Well, I guess that's pretty normal nowadays<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><36>Me, I get called home each year for the holidays to help out with the family feast! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <26>What?!<15> So you never<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>make your own home-cooked meals?<30><87>But it's so good! And fun!<15> And food tastes way better when you prepare it yourself! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <18>At first I thought maybe they were trying to pick a fight or something, so I had my guard up, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
AN FreeA Always <7>I thought they were gonna ask me to do some nutty favor for 'em, so I was all set to tell 'em to forget it!
AN FreeA Always <7>I thought maybe they were gonna confess some secrets to me, so I was feeling kinda nauseous, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
AN FreeA Always <728>2
AN FreeA Always <13>They just wanted to give me a gift from their recent trip!<619><36> Kind of a weird place for that, <6><42>!
AN FreeA Always <13>They just wanted to give my book back to me!<619><36> That was a weird way to do that, though. <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <13>They just wanted to tell me about a new hole they dug!<619><36> What a weirdo! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <18>I always look at the horoscopes in newspapers and magazines,<6> and I've tried other methods too! <649>Flower fortunes, star signs, weather fortunes, fish fortunes,<6> gyroid fortunes<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <18>No matter which way I do it, the results are the same, so it's pretty believable!
AN FreeA Always <36>If the <1145> horoscope is bad in the morning, it ruins my whole day! <18>That's why I only check it at the end of the day.<30><13>That way if I mess something up, I can just blame it on luck! <15><25>Pretty smart, huh? <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <26>The other day I spent hours looking for <77><54>, since it's supposedly my lucky item! <38>Of course<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I'm not really sure what I'm meant to do with it now that I have it! <6><41><42>!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <40>It would be fun to be a professional fortune-teller and read fortunes for other people! <28>But how would I become a fortune- teller anyway?<30>I wouldn't have to take some kind of crazy class or anything, would I?<1506>
AN FreeA Always <18>The results of fortune telling are interesting, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>I think I'm more into the stuff they use! <649>Crystals, cards, talismans, rubber duckies<8>.<8>.<8>.<15><18> It's all so mysterious!<30><212>Whenever I pay for a fortune, I try to note what tools are being used! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <26>So the other day I went to a swap meet for <263> stuff<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><13>Yeah, you really find out about your true nature at a place like that!<30><38>The shoppers were like predators hunting down the best deals! <6><41><42>!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <13>The other day I went to an international <33> buffet with a friend! <38>Man,<6> your true nature really comes out in a place like that!<15><16><30><18>You had to fake out all the other people to get to the best <33> first!<30><44>It was pretty thrilling actually! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <26>Oh no!<15> I was supposed to call my mom yesterday!<30>Oh, man<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I didn't answer her last letter, so I bet she's gonna be mad at me. <13>It's nice that she cares about me, though! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <1509><1510>
AN FreeA Always <18>Hey, <70>, scary camp stories are a summer thing, right?<15> <28>Do you have any good ones?<234>?<1511>#x0;(<1512> Oh, yes. I'm too chicken. Well...
AN FreeA Always <23>Whoa! <6>That's awesome!<6> You sound like you've got a good one!<30><13>Next time everyone's gathered somewhere, you should tell it!<6><30>Don't tell me when we're alone!<6> That's just asking for trouble! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <110>Ahahaha!<6> I know what you mean!<15><16> I get waaaay too into scary stories, and then I get freaked out! <38>If you told me a scary story right now, I probably wouldn't sleep for a week! <6><41><42>!<15><16>
AN FreeA Always <167>Ah! Don't tell it now!<15><16> Tell it when more people are around!<6> There's safety in numbers, dude! I really can't handle ghosts and stuff<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><36>so I can't stand to hear scary stories when I'm by myself! <38>Of course, if you did start telling it, I wouldn't be able to tear myself away! <6><41><42>!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <26>Scary stories have a strange effect on my body. In <263>, they get my heart pounding and warm me up! <53>But in summer they give me chills running down my spine, and that cools me down!<6> It's weird!<1506>
AN FreeA Always <26>Hey, so this has nothing to do with anything, but<15><28> which vehicle gives you the least motion sickness?<234>E<1515>#x0;<1516> Train. Boat. Both are bad.
AN FreeA Always <23>Oh, yeah?<15> You think a train rocks less than a boat?
AN FreeA Always Man, <6>I get motion sickness while I'm walking sometimes<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> So I gotta be careful what I ride on! <36>I really need to take my time when I'm planning a trip! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <23><6>Really?<15> <18>Yeah, <6>I guess if the sea is calm it wouldn't rock that much<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
AN FreeA Always <110>Hahaha!<6> You too, huh?<15><13><619><18> Yeah, motion sickness is the worst<38>especially on vacation trips! Then it gets all mixed up with homesickness! <6><41><42>!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <26>Have you heard about a connection between ears and motion sickness, <70>?<30><18>They say people can get sick if their ears are too sensitive! <1519>#x0;
AN FreeA Always I've got pretty big ears<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><18>so I guess they're sensitive, <6><42>.<15>
AN FreeA Always <8>.<8>.<8>.<6><28>I wonder if ear size has anything to do with it.<30><36>Maybe folks with bigger ears are in a rough spot! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <13>As much as possible, don't fight fights you can't win!<15><16> Pretty simple, don't you think? <18>Of course if you're protecting someone, that's one thing<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13> But otherwise, sometimes running is OK!
AN FreeA Always <13>As much as possible, don't fight unless you have to!<15> It's that simple!<30><7>Most encounters can be settled in the initial stare-down!<30><36>Look your opponent right in the eye, and if you think you can't win<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>run!
AN FreeA Always <13>Know when to let up!<15><30><36>Once you've scared someone away, there's no need to chase 'em down!<30><16>If you do, you're just a bully!
AN FreeA Always <13>Don't break eye contact!<15> <16>Stare 'em down, even when meeting someone for the first time! <18>If you look someone right in the eye, you can tell if they're a threat<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><13>People who aren't serious threats will usually look away, so you can avoid a pointless dustup!
AN FreeA Always <13>Don't show your trump card too early!<6> It's tricky, but you can do it!<30><18>If you've got, like, a water balloon up your sleeve, you'll feel at ease knowing you can use it whenever! <38>Of course, you could just haul off and throw it at 'em at the get-go just to be safe, <6><42>!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <13>My dreams for the future seemed to change all the time!<15> I was all over the place!<6><16> For instance<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><1523>V
AN FreeA Always <44>On one page I wrote something like, "I'm gonna be <77><54> maker and change the world!"<16> <38>I don't really remember, but I guess I used to think that being <77> <54> maker was cool!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <44>On one page I wrote something like, "I want to win a big, important <32> competition!" <13>Can you imagine?<8> I'm really more of a referee or coach type, not a serious athlete!<6> What a crazy kid!
AN FreeA Always <44>On one page I wrote something like, "I'll plan to make the very best <33> in the world!" <13>What is that all about?<6><16> I also wrote in there somewhere that I wanted to open a flower shop!<6> I was so girly!
AN FreeA Always <212>By the way, I'd be so embarrassed if anyone found that diary,<6> so I just buried it! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeA Always <110>Sometimes in the diary I referred to my mom as "Mama," which is weird because we never called her that!<15><13> <38>We always called her "Mom." But maybe I secretly wanted to call her "Mama" sometimes<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>
AN FreeA Always <18>When I was a kid, I'd go fishing and hunting for bugs every single day<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><110> I guess it's no different now!<15><13>
AN FreeA Always <18>When I was a kid, I used to pick fruit and plant stuff all the time<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><110>which pretty much describes me now!<15><13>
