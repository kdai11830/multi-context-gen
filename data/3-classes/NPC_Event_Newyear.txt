NPC Event Newyear <214>I've prepared a small present to celebrate the new year.<30>Let me know when you've made room in your pockets so I can give it to you!
NPC Event Newyear <214>I've prepared a small present to celebrate the new year.<670> Here you go! Enjoy!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, I had mice on my mind, <18>so I got some mouse <375>decorations<375> to celebrate. <40>Hey, why not? They're very cute, <13>so I hope you display one in your home for all your guests to see!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, I feel like it's time to give oxen their due, <18>so I've got some cute ox <375>decorations<375> to give out. I think they'll make your home feel very New Yearsy, so please display one for everyone to see!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, I decided that tigers need more respect, <18>so I wanted to honor them with some tiger <375>decorations<375>. They look very noble, even in their smaller form. I hope you display one in your house!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, I feel that rabbits are the really "in" thing, <18>so I got some rabbit <375>decorations<375> to celebrate.<30><40>They just make me want to develop by leaps and bounds in <1226>!<619> <13>I hope you feel the same with one!
NPC Event Newyear <367>Aren't dragons so cool? <13>I decided to rekindle my geeky side this year, <18>so I got some dragon <375>decorations<375>. You should place it in your room, <110>but not near anything flammable!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, <53>I figured it was time to pay respect to snakes since they typically have such a hard life. I mean, <31>they have to slither wherever they go! That must be really hard! <13>To make them feel better, I decided that <18>I'd be giving away some special snake <375>decorations<375> this year. <13>They're cute and white, so why not display one in your home? <40>They can really add a lot to a room!
NPC Event Newyear <214>Horses work so hard for us, but they don't really get a special day just for them. That's why I've decided to give out <18>some special horse <375>decorations <375>this year to thank them. <13>You should display it in your room proudly and thank horses for all their back-breaking labor!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year, it felt like the right time to honor sheep, <367>what with them being so fluffy and cute, <40>like me! <212>OK, maybe they're fluffier and a lot cuter than me. Just by a bit.<30>Anyway, <18>I got some special sheep <375>decorations<375> to celebrate with. <40>I bet you'll just fall in love with it!
NPC Event Newyear <214>The new year is a good excuse to just loosen up and learn to swing like the monkeys through trees. That's why, for this year, <18>I wanted to get us in the right frame of mind with some monkey <375>decorations<375>. <13>You could put one in your house and just feel your attitude loosen up! <40>I certainly did!
NPC Event Newyear <214>Something about a new year makes me wish I could fly free, like a bird. <367>Wouldn't that be so much fun? <214>That's why, to celebrate the new year, <18>I got some special little bird <375>decorations<375> for everyone. <13>You should display one in your home to remind you about your dreams taking flight! <40>Good luck in <1226>!
NPC Event Newyear <214>My doggie nature kicked in pretty strongly when the new year rolled around, <53>though I don't know why... <13>The town needed some oomph, <18>so I got some doggie <375>decorations<375> for everyone to help celebrate <1226>! <219>You've got to go with what you know some days, <40>and I know what it's like to be a cute puppy!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year just has a very "boar" sort of vibe to it, don't you think?<30><40>Well, I certainly think so! <18>That's why I decided to help us celebrate with some special boar <375>decorations<375>. <87>They're ever so cute!<2289> <13>You should set one up in your room right away! <40>I'll bet you'll get the same vibe I did!
NPC Event Newyear <214>I'll be giving out the <375>New Year's presents<375> all day today.<30><13>If you'd like one, please make room in your pockets and come talk to me again before the end of the day!
NPC Event Newyear <214>I've prepared a little <375>New Year's present<375>, so why not take it now?
NPC Event Newyear <214><41><439>, is your first goal of the new year to move into a home of your very own? I think that's a goal you can easily attain,<8> so work hard and make it come true! I'm rooting for you!
NPC Event Newyear <214>I hope you'll do your best for <107> this year, just like you always do!
NPC Event Newyear <649>When you think of New Year's,<8> you think of fireworks, isn't that right?<6> <13>I absolutely love <367>fireworks.
NPC Event Newyear <214>I wonder how everyone in town is spending the first day of the new year... Hopefully well!
NPC Event Newyear <214>This year I'll do my very best to support you and see if we can further develop <107>!
