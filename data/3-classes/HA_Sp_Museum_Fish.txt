HA Sp Museum_Fish <53>This water tank<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> There's still a lot of space in here. I wish I could use some of this space for training.<30><87>Freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly stroke! It's just a matter of time before I'm the world champ!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <214>This room is really amazing!<619> I hope they get more and more fish and continue to grow! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Museum_Fish This is awesome! Just look at the great variety of fish in here!<30><110>There's just so many! I'm starting to feel dizzy just from looking at them!<15><13><30><214>This is all because of those who made donations! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <18>This room is just amazing! There are all kinds of fish and other sea creatures in here!<6><30><18>Whoever collected all of these fish<8> probably has some great skills!<30><121>Whoa! Check out that huge one in there with the others!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <87>This place is nice, isn't it? This is one of the best spots in <107>!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <53>I wonder how these guys can keep breathing under the water like that! What's their secret? <128>All right! I'm gonna watch them until I figure it out!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <53>What if those guys are plotting an escape from this water tank?<30><110>Ha ha! No, I doubt it!<15><13>
HA Sp Museum_Fish Hmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><16>If I had a huge pool like this at home,<6><87> I'd be able to swim all I want! <8><41><42>!
HA Sp Museum_Fish Unfortunately, the fish I caught isn't in this water tank<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><214>Catch and release is my motto! Whenever I catch a fish, I put it back in the water right away!
HA Sp Museum_Fish <28>Don't you feel like it gets cooler when you stare at the water tank like this?<619> <214>I'm not sweating anymore!
