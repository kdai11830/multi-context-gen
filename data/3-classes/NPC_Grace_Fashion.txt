NPC Grace Fashion It's time for...<1481><30><669><1152><286>GRACIE'S <286><6>FASHION<286><17651><12737> <3142>CHECK!<286>
NPC Grace Fashion <214>You had one thing to do: dress according to that theme! Let's see if you managed to pull it off.
NPC Grace Fashion <53>First, we must step back and view the outfit as a whole. <1172>Does it meet my exorbitantly high standards?
NPC Grace Fashion <53>It comes together well, of course... <36>But it IS a bit vanilla of you to wear all one theme, don't you think? However<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
NPC Grace Fashion <26>I see what you're trying to do here, honey. That's a bold move, mixing two styles like that!
NPC Grace Fashion <561>No. Considering the current theme, <1172>it's just not right.
NPC Grace Fashion <561>Unfortunately, <1172>neither of those styles quite fits with the theme I gave you.
NPC Grace Fashion The good news is you're not a complete lost cause when it comes to fashion fabulosity. But you need to think long and hard about that theme I gave you. Then come back to me with a new look!
NPC Grace Fashion <53>Something about this combination seems off balance. Some items are supposed to have real star power... <36>But your outfit is putting a spotlight on the items that should be playing second fiddle! <13>Don't worry I'm not giving up on you just yet. Focus on balance, and bring me back another outfit!
NPC Grace Fashion <7>When you put dynamic pieces together, they'll just cancel each other out. What's the point in that? <128>So if you must mix moods,<1172> you have to find a way to let each individual item tell its own story, <1172>honey!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>I can tell you were listening when I gave you that theme, <1172><44>'cause you completely nailed it, honey!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>And bonus points to you for using one of my original designs. <6>Flattery gets you everywhere!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>Talent like yours deserves to be rewarded, <1172>don't you think? So here. Take <77><834>! It comes straight from my personal collection. <13>Think of it as my way of encouraging you.
NPC Grace Fashion I don't have all day,<1172> but I'm willing to wait awhile so you can go and empty your pockets, honey.
NPC Grace Fashion Phew!<1172><36> It's good to know there's at least one person in town who isn't a complete fashion frump. But it's painfully obvious that my work here isn't done. At least I'm off to a good start!
NPC Grace Fashion <53>Hmmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> Yet another enlightening fashion check. Verrrry interesting.<30><13>Each stylish experience here is leading me closer to making a decision about opening a new shop!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>This particular fashion check has just about pushed me off my cliff of indecision and into a<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>decision.
NPC Grace Fashion <53>I've done my share of these little fashion checks,<1172> and it's given me a lot of time to think... <214>And I think I'm going to open a new boutique right here in town! <16><6>Now, don't go getting all emotional. <36>I don't have the time to deal with a hysterical fan!<1172> I need to start planning my grand opening. You'll be my first customer, honey.<6> Don't tell anyone I said this, <1172>but you've been an inspiration to me!
NPC Grace Fashion And now I must be off! <6><7>But I'll be back again for yet another fashion check, <1172>so always dress to impress. <36>I don't want to see you in rags next time we run into each other, if you get my drift.<680><616> Ciao, honey!
NPC Grace Fashion <36>This outfit is all over the place, honey. You've got all headliners and no opening acts! <7>And what really kills me is the fact that not one of these pieces really fits the theme I gave you!
NPC Grace Fashion <7>You're not doing my designs any favors by wearing them like that.<6> Start over!
NPC Grace Fashion <36>Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to start with this outfit. <6> Go and change everything about it!
NPC Grace Fashion Do you want to hear the brutal truth?<6> This outfit is a hot mess.<1172> Too many different styles, honey! <36>Go think about the theme I gave you, and pick a piece to be the focal point. <6>Does that sound so hard?
NPC Grace Fashion <53>There's no focal pointthat much is obvious. But at least I can see you stuck to the theme. <36>I suppose you did your best, honey.<670> And for that,<1172> I'll be kind enough to let you pass for today!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>To congratulate you on your fair- to-middling fashion choices, <1172>here is <4315><834>. I designed it myself, so you'd better wear it well.<7> Don't make me regret giving it to you!
NPC Grace Fashion <13>To congratulate you for your fair- to-middling fashion choices, <1172>here is <4315><834>. I designed it myself, so you'd better wear it well. <619><72>Oh!<1172> If only you had a little more room in your pockets! <7>I don't have all day,<1172> so hurry off and empty your pockets <1172>so I can give you this GracieGrace original!
