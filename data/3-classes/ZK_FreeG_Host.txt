ZK FreeG Host <3695>#x0;
ZK FreeG Host <7>Any cool friends you have must be introduced to me immediately<8>.<8>.<8>.<20879> <40>Hah ha!<2289> I'm just kidding!<8> .<8>.<8>.<8>Probably!
ZK FreeG Host <7>All right!<2289> I should be prepared to say hi <40>if anyone from out of town stops by!
ZK FreeG Host <40>Don't you worry!<8> <41><42>!<619> <13>I'll make sure not to say anything rude when I meet anyone<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK FreeG Host <13>When you get tired of playing with friends,<8> press <375>START <375>and then select <375>End the multiplayer session<375>. It's pretty useful because you can disband everyone at once. Handy when you're in a hurry. <18>Though as host,<8> you should let your friends know about it before you end the party!
