ZK Sp Museum_Art <13>Things are really getting exciting in here. Our exhibition hall is filling out rather nicely,<8> <70>!
ZK Sp Museum_Art <13>The collection in this exhibition hall has grown quite a bit,<8> don't you think, <70>? <44>I don't want to take all the credit<8>.<8>.<8>. <25>But I'm gonna! You're welcome!
ZK Sp Museum_Art <13>The art collection in <107> is amazing,<8> don't you think, <70>? <38>I'm pretty sure it's hard to find an exhibition hall as complete as this one,<8> <42>!
ZK Sp Museum_Art <31>Hold on,<8> <70>!<2289> It's too soon for you to see this room!<619> It's still pretty much empty<8>.<8>.<8>. <53><2289>It would be really helpful if someone could donate some stuff, but<8>.<8>.<8>.
ZK Sp Museum_Art <53><2289>Our collection is still pretty small and sorta disappointing, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><38>We appreciate your patience in the matter,<8> <70>!
ZK Sp Museum_Art <41><70>,<2289> <28>how's the art section in this town compared to the one where you're from?<20879> <13>Recently<8> our collection has grown quite a bit,<2289> so we're finally at this nice, full point,<8> <42>.
ZK Sp Museum_Art <7>The art collection in your town and the one in my town<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><13>I'm excited to see which town will complete their collection first!
ZK Sp Museum_Art <13>This town put a lot of effort into building a nice, fully stocked art gallery. <110>I think it looks pretty good! <40>Make sure to enjoy it as much as you can,<8> <70>!
