NPC CafeOrder Grace A cup of coffee, honey. To go, natch. <619>Give me a taste of that fabulous <375>blend<375>.
NPC CafeOrder Grace A cup of coffee, honey. To go, natch. <619>And <375>hold the milk<375>!
NPC CafeOrder Grace A cup of coffee to go, honey. <670><561>And <375>ixnay<375> on the sugar, sugar.<1172> I'm jumpy enough without it!
NPC CafeOrder Grace <214>Merci, sweet thing. <1172>I'm going to slurp this down like nobody's business!
NPC CafeOrder Grace <1172><26>Such deliciousness! <619><3527><13>Aren't you the little barista fashionista, <670>darling! I'll have to come see you again.
NPC CafeOrder Grace <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> This does<1172> NOT feel right on my tongue. <6>Where's the sweet deliciousness? The bold boldness? <7>Listen, honey,<1172> I came here for the <375>blended <375>coffee. Not this dreck!<1172> Try to remember next time.
NPC CafeOrder Grace <121><670>EWWW<286>!<286><30><286><7>Honey, this coffee has <375>milk<375> in it!<1172> Everyone knows that milk is SO out of style. <36>Next time, you've got to remember I prefer my coffee black.
NPC CafeOrder Grace <121><670>EWWW!<286><30><7><375>SUGAR<375>! In what world would I ever drink my coffee with sugar, <1172>sugar?<1172> I drink it black! Try not to forget!
NPC CafeOrder Grace Perhaps I didn't make myself clear,<1172> darling. My fault, I'm sure! <1172>But you got my order rather<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>wrong. <36>You managed to get the <375>beans<375> right, but that's the only thing right about this drink! <670>What a waste! <1172>Ta-ta!
NPC CafeOrder Grace Apparently there's been a bit of a breakdown in communications, darling. Do forgive me... <561>But this order is definitely NOT right!<670> At least there was no <375>milk<375> involved. Oh well. <6><13>C'est la vie!
NPC CafeOrder Grace My order must have been awfully confusing, darling. And for that, I certainly apologize... <36>But at least there's no <375>sugar <375>in here, sugar! <6>You got THAT right! And now I'm off.<1172> Ta-ta!
NPC CafeOrder Grace <121><670>BLECH!<286><30><36>Oh, honey!<1172> Was my order all that confusing? I'm not sure how you managed to get this one wrong. <13>Let me give you a bit of advice:<1172> part-time job or no,<1172> you have to LISTEN to your clientele! <36>Try to keep your little eyes and ears open next time, won't you?<1172> That's a good child. Ta-ta!
