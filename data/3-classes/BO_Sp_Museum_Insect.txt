BO Sp Museum_Insect <214>It's really nice and warm in here.<15> It's perfect for a nap!
BO Sp Museum_Insect This is the insect exhibit,<6> but I guess it's still a work in progress.<30><214>It's so nice and warm in here that I'm just gonna hang out until it's complete,<8> <42>!
BO Sp Museum_Insect <214>It's a good thing I'm not scared of bugs.<6> <31>Otherwise, I'd be completely wigging out right now!
BO Sp Museum_Insect <141>This place has every single bug out there.<6> It's like a dream come true!<30><16>But when I pinched myself, <318>it really hurt!<619> <87>So<6> I guess it isn't a dream after all!
BO Sp Museum_Insect <141>It's always warm in here,<6> so it's the perfect spot for napping.
BO Sp Museum_Insect I heard you can actually eat some bugs.<30><53>Hm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Which of these bugs do you think would be the tastiest?
BO Sp Museum_Insect I can't tell if that one bug over there is really rare<6> or if it's just a piece of lint.
BO Sp Museum_Insect <214>Bugs are like the lobsters of the land.<6> I wonder if they'd taste good with some melted butter and lemon.
BO Sp Museum_Insect <87>I love how warm it is in here!<6> It's one of my favorite spots in <107>, <8><42>.
BO Sp Museum_Insect There's a bug in here that I've had my eyes on for a while.<6> I just can't seem to catch one for myself. <31>Collecting bugs would be so much easier if we could just catch the ones in this exhibit.
