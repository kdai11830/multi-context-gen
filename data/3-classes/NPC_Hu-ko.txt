NPC Hu-ko By the way<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><439>,<1172><214> this is the first time you've seen this floor, is that right? <16>If you have the time,<1172> I'd like to briefly explain about this floor<8>.<8>.<8>. <28>Would you like to listen now?<796><797> OK! Next time.
NPC Hu-ko All right. If you have any questions, <214>please don't hesitate to ask me!
NPC Hu-ko Unfortunately, <3142>there is nothing being displayed right now<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <13>But I'm sure that will soon change!
NPC Hu-ko Currently, a personal exhibit titled <25484> is being held on this floor!
NPC Hu-ko We're currently holding displays of the <25484> and <25484> exhibits!
NPC Hu-ko We're currently holding a number of displays on this floor, including the <25484> exhibit. Also, the <25484> and the <25484> exhibits are set up for viewing!
NPC Hu-ko We're currently holding displays of the <25484> and <25484> exhibits. Also the <25484> and <25484> exhibits <214>as well!<8> You should see them all!
NPC Hu-ko <214>Well, I hope you enjoy yourself!
NPC Hu-ko Citizens of this town can use any exhibit room on this floor as they see fit for a display! We rent personal exhibit spaces for a fair price,<1172> <214>so please let me know if you want to use them! <16>You can decorate the rooms in the same way you would decorate your very own home. If you use the <375>locker <375>next to the staircase,<1172> <214>you can easily grab items from home to use in the exhibit. You can also store any items you may be carrying,<8> so it makes things very convenient! <87><41><439>, I hope you enjoy crafting a lot of unique displays!
NPC Hu-ko <16><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><214>That is all I have to say about the personal exhibit spaces!<30>Also, <1172>I sell souvenirs here in the hall, so come by often.<30>Plus, I stock commemorative goods when the collections downstairs get large enough.<8> <18>Watch for those!
NPC Hu-ko <214>Would you like to talk about the personal exhibit spaces?<8740><1099>( I want to display! Please explain! Never mind.
NPC Hu-ko <214>Would you like to talk about the personal exhibit spaces?<21657><1099><1418> I need more space! Dismantle my display! Please explain! Never mind.
NPC Hu-ko <214>Would you like to talk about the personal exhibit spaces?<8740><1099>( Dismantle my display! Please explain! Never mind.
NPC Hu-ko What would you like<28> to know about?<21657><1099><1418> What's this room for? How to display things. How to dismantle. I changed my mind.
NPC Hu-ko Is there anything else <28>I can help you with?<21657><1099><1099> What's this room for? How to display things. How to dismantle. Nope, I'm good!
NPC Hu-ko <214>Understood.<619> Please take your time looking around!
NPC Hu-ko If you'd like to exhibit something, you can rent an exhibit space for a very reasonable <375>10,000 Bells<375>. <214>Once you rent it, you can use it for an unlimited time or until you choose to stop displaying. <16>Also, one person can use multiple exhibit spaces if necessary!
NPC Hu-ko After you rent the exhibit space, you can change its layout as you like, similar to your own room! If you use the locker next to the staircase, <214>you can easily grab items from your home! It makes it simple to pull out items for your exhibit rooms or put things away. <13>It's rather convenient!
NPC Hu-ko Also, if you check the sign in front of the personal exhibit space...<30>you can set a custom design for the poster or set a name for the exhibit. <214>It's like a room advertisement!
NPC Hu-ko When you want to stop using an exhibit room, please let me know!
NPC Hu-ko When you do so, I will move all items from the exhibit room to the locker next to the staircase. However, if you have any items that can't be put in the locker, I won't be able to dismantle your exhibit room. The same applies if you have too many items and can't fit everything into the locker. In that case,<1172> please organize your things a bit before talking to me!
NPC Hu-ko <1172><72> Oh!<670> You're <28><439>, the mayor of <107>, is that correct?
NPC Hu-ko <1172><72> Ah!<670> <16>You live in this town,<214> correct?
NPC Hu-ko Oh, are you sure?<619> <214>Well, please look around as much as you'd like!
NPC Hu-ko Uh-oh, it seems like you don't have enough Bells right now<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>Please come back again after collecting enough!
NPC Hu-ko Oh, but your pockets are full, so I can't give you the item right now<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>Please come back after making a little extra space for this item!
NPC Hu-ko <214>Yes, sure thing!

NPC Hu-ko <214>Thank you for waiting!<619> I hope to see you again soon!

NPC Hu-ko When you close your exhibit room,<1172> all of the items in it will be moved to the locker.<1172> <28>Is that OK?<849><796><797> No problem! I changed my mind.
