BO Sp Museum_Art There aren't many paintings yet,<6> so this room is nice and quiet.<30><617>Actually,<6> it's the perfect place for a nap,<8> <42>.
BO Sp Museum_Art <50>This place is still pretty empty, <8><42>.<30><44>It'd be kind of sad if it stayed like this,<6> so I'm thinking of displaying some of my own works.
BO Sp Museum_Art <141>This is a really amazing collection!<6> All of us in <107> are so proud of it!
BO Sp Museum_Art <87>Amazing!<6> This is a perfect collection!<6> Whoever donated all of this is my personal hero!
BO Sp Museum_Art I tried donating this one painting I did,<6> but <375>Blathers<375> turned me down, <8><42>.
BO Sp Museum_Art Being in a room this tidy<6> <31>is kind of weirding me out,<8> <42>.
BO Sp Museum_Art I don't know much about art,<6> but <141>these paintings look cool to me!
BO Sp Museum_Art <26>Wow!<6> You're really good!<6> So you painted one of these?<6> Color me impressed! <16>What's that?<6> You didn't paint any of these?<6> <31>Oh, then never mind,<8> <42>.
BO Sp Museum_Art <214>My town's collection is pretty great, huh?
BO Sp Museum_Art <44>You must really love art if you came all this way to look at our collection,<8> <42>.
