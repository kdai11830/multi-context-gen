AN FreeF MidWinter Dude<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>it is sooooo coooold! Makes you really appreciate the warmth of the sun! <18>I guess I take it for granted, but the sun works its butt off to keep us all warm, <6><42>!
AN FreeF MidWinter <18>As soon as you realize daylight isn't coming, it really makes you miss the light, you know? <367>Ahhh!<6> I can't wait for that warm, sunny sunshine, <6><42>!
AN FreeF MidWinter Hey, uh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><28>why exactly is it that the sun doesn't come out during the <375>Winter Solstice<375>? <53>I mean, does the sun go off to some faraway place for a one-day vacation or something? <128>Arggh! Dude!<15> Now I can't stop thinking about it! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeF MidWinter <53>So basically the <375>Winter Solstice<375> is the day when the sun is weakest?<30><23>I got an idea! To keep from catching a cold, I'm gonna eat something warm! <13>Too bad you can't just open up a can of sunlight and make some sunlight soup, <6><42>!
AN FreeF MidWinter <28>So the sun not being out today doesn't necessarily make the <375>Winter Solstice<375> the coldest day of the year. <53>I guess the amount of daylight we get doesn't really have any bearing on how cold it is. So why is it so cold then?<15><128> Dude!<15> <287>Thinking about this stuff is gonna give me a fever, <6><42>!<15><7>
