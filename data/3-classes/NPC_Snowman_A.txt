NPC Snowman A <1075>WAHHHHHHHHH!<286><286><30>Oh!<15> Did you make me?!<286><30>You're amazing! You made me look so cool!

NPC Snowman A Awwwwwwww! So close<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>You were doing pretty good most of the way<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Next time, try to make me just a little bit more cool!
NPC Snowman A Aw, man. So close<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>The balance between my head and my body is just a little off. I'm a bit worried I might tip over!<30> But hey! I'm sorry to complain after you worked so hard to build me!<30>I think I can make the most of this. I'll be living here for a little while, so you'll be seeing a lot of me!
NPC Snowman A <1075>WAAAAHHHH!<286><286><30>How did this happen? I can't believe it! <286>How did I get such a big head?<30><1152>WAAAAAAHHHHH!<15> I'm gonna tip over, and everyone will laugh at me, and I'll be "that weird snowtyke"!
NPC Snowman A Huh?! Did you put this head on me? You did, didn't you?<30>Did you even think about the consequences of your actions?<30>Sigh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Everyone's going to make fun of me!
NPC Snowman A Is the rest of my family around?<30> Hey!<6> It feels like<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>they're all here!
NPC Snowman A Are my mom and dad and brother around?<30> Oh!<6> It feels like<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>they're not!
NPC Snowman A Thank you for bringing my entire family together!<796><1099> You're welcome! What do you mean?
NPC Snowman A Huh? My bad. I guess I thought you were someone else<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman A We all look so cool! We're the perfect snowfamily!
NPC Snowman A Mom looks a little weird, but other than that we're a great snowfamily!
NPC Snowman A Big brother is the only one who looks a little off. Must be a thing with snowteenagers. Other than that, we're a pretty cool snowfamily!
NPC Snowman A Dad is the only one who looks a little funny. But other than that, we're a pretty cool snowfamily!
NPC Snowman A Mom and my big brother look kinda strange, but I'm just happy to have the whole family together!
NPC Snowman A Mom and Dad look kind of weird, but I'm happy to have the whole family together!
NPC Snowman A Dad and my big brother are looking kind of strange, but I'm just glad the whole family is together!
NPC Snowman A I hate to say it, but I'm the coolest- looking one in my family. Everyone else is just a little off. But it doesn't matter. I'm just happy to have the whole family together!
NPC Snowman A I'm going to send you the most awesome thank-you letter for making my family so perfect!
NPC Snowman A I need to send you a thank-you!<15> Keep an eye on your mailbox!<30>Also, if you ever make another snowtyke like me again<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>please make his entire family super awesome and cool looking!<30>I bet that'd make him really, really super-duper happy!
NPC Snowman A I'm just a kid, so I don't have much I can give you, but I still want to thank you!<30>I'm sure you'll see something in your mailbox soon, so keep an eye out!<30>Also, if you ever make a snowtyke like me again<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Please make his entire family super awesome and cool! I bet that would make him really happy!
NPC Snowman A Starting today, I'm going to live in this town!
NPC Snowman A Hi there!<30>Someday when I grow up, I wanna be a snowman just like my pop!
NPC Snowman A My body might be cold, but my heart is warm.
NPC Snowman A Do you think I've grown any since yesterday?<30>After all, kids grow up quick, right?
NPC Snowman A Someday I want to be able to pluck fruit off a tree.<30>I bet it'd taste yummy if I froze it and turned it into sherbet.
NPC Snowman A If you ever get a sunburn, come see me!<619> I'll cool it down for you.
NPC Snowman A Someday soon I'll need to grow up big and snowy like my pop<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman A I think I have a lot in common with a double-scoop ice-cream cone<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
NPC Snowman A I'm so bored<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Is there anything fun I can do?
NPC Snowman A I think we'll have to say good-bye soon!<30>But please make another snowtyke like me someday, and play with him a lot!
NPC Snowman A I'm kinda small, so please try not to step on me!
NPC Snowman A Even if things aren't going so great, keep your chin up!<30>Only<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>if you keep your chin up and it's a sunny day, you might look right into the bright, hot sun!
NPC Snowman A I'm so happy I was made to look so cool!
NPC Snowman A Everyone looks at me and gets all excited and says I'm really cute.<30>It makes me happy, but I'd be even happier if they said I looked cool!
NPC Snowman A I really admire child actors.<30>I want to study acting and be on TV someday!
NPC Snowman A It made me really happy I was built to look so cool!<30>I hope I look this cool the next time someone builds me!
NPC Snowman A As soon as I came to life, I could tell I was a little strange<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman A How do I look compared to yesterday? Do I look any cooler?<30>I guess I can't expect to change much in just one day<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
NPC Snowman A I might not look the coolest, but I've decided that I'll be the best student out there! First I'm going to get really good at counting to 10!
NPC Snowman A The next time you make me, please make me look cool!
NPC Snowman A I wonder what everyone thinks when they look at me.<30>Do you think they can even tell that I'm a little snowman?
NPC Snowman A I have to act like a proper snowman so people will know I'm a proper snowman.
NPC Snowman A Life is kind of a tough balancing act for me. I feel like I might tip over!
NPC Snowman A I hope the next time I'm made, I'm made as a snowman with perfect head-to-body balance!
NPC Snowman A It seems like it's getting hotter all of a sudden<8>.<8>.<8>. I miss the snowflakes.
NPC Snowman A A moment ago I had a butterfly land on me. I've never looked so fashionable!
NPC Snowman A It seems like the spring everyone has been waiting for is finally here!<30>It's so comforting and warm. It seems like a lot of fun for folks who like comforting and warm things!
NPC Snowman A Spring is nice, but I think winter is the best season!
NPC Snowman A I hope we can play again next winter!
NPC Snowman A It's rare for a snowman to last until spring. I wanna brag to everyone!
