KO FreeF MoonJPN <26>Anyway, you know tonight's the night for <375>Tsukimi<375>?<30><18>It gets called different things all over the world, but we're sticking with "Tsukimi" forever. <40>Oh well, doesn't matter! <13>The moon just looks cool, and that's good enough for me!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Oh, that reminds me!<6> I hear we're gonna have clear weather tonight!<6> <13>Perfect for <375>Tsukimi<375>! <18>I suppose<8> there's a certain charm when the moon <13>peeks out from behind clouds, though!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Tonight's the night for <375>Tsukimi<375><8>.<8>.<8>.<15> <13>Are you one of those "dango first, moon later" types?<441><6774> I like the moon. I like the dango!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <110>GAHAHA!<680><214> Just what I expected from you, <70>!<15> Way to stick with tradition! <18>Whoever thought up the idea of looking at the moon while eating dango rice cakes was pretty smart!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <110>GAHAHA!<680><214> Way to be honest!<30><38>I suppose it'd be pretty awkward if your stomach started growling while we were looking at the moon! <18>Make sure you eat a big dinner! <110>GAHAHA!<6> <41><42>!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <13>Look at it, <70>!<6> Now THAT'S a moon worth viewing!<30><44>I wouldn't be surprised one bit if we saw a rabbit appear<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Would you?! <110>GAHAHA!<6> <41><42>! <38>Get it? Because rabbits are always pounding mochi on the moon!<30><26>What?<8> They don't tell you that story where you're from? <36>What do you think's up there? A man? <561><8>Weird.
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Every year when it's time for <375>Tsukimi<375>, I'm always reminded <13>of how great the moon is! <18>Really makes you appreciate the fact that it's not falling on our town anytime soon! Uh, incidentally, you don't have a flute or ocarina on you just in case, do you? <38>Can't be too careful...
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Since I don't normally spend my time staring up at the moon, I've never noticed before, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <367>It's real pretty<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> Just like a bunch of cheese or something equally as delicious!<6> <41><42>!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <774>
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Hey, <70>,<8> this might sound kinda odd on a night like this, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><28>When do you think the moon looks the best?<1480><4345><3589><947><3589><797> During a crescent moon. During a waxing moon. During a full moon. During a waning moon. I'm not really sure.
KO FreeF MoonJPN Ouch ouch ouch<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I've been looking up at the moon for so long that I've got a crick in my neck! <16>But<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><13>somehow I just can't take my eyes off the moon tonight!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Seeing a moon like this makes me want to work hard!<30><28>Hmmm?<15> Why? <110>Because a rabbit's gotta pound out some mochi on the night of a full moon, right? <25>You see these muscles? That's from practicing just in case I needed to take over for the moon rabbit. <16>Little-known fact: <44>the rabbit that lives up there is my cousin! <214>Yeah! <616>We used to play as kids! <36>Now he's too busy to even stop by and have a cup of tea or nothing!<30> And my mom tells me,<8> <7><1068>"Why don't you do something with your life like your moon cousin is?!"<3505> <1152><128>Because I'm busy, that's why!<30><38>Sorry, got a little carried away.<8> <13>But hey, don't let me stop you from enjoying the moon tonight!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <18>Did you hear?<8> They say there's a rabbit on the moon who pounds out mochi on nights when it's full! <38>I wonder why it's not something like <77><46> instead... Oh well!<6> <41><42>!<15><16>
KO FreeF MoonJPN <23>Oh, a crescent moon?<15> <13>I can see what you mean!<6><30>Those curves are what people think of when they hear the word "moon"!<30><38>Heh. Well<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Hopefully that doesn't hurt the moon's feelings, since it's all full tonight!<6> <41><42>!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <23>Oh! <6>Quite the moon fan, aren't you?<15> <13>You're talking about when the moon is half lit and half dark, right? <36>Seeing the moon like that<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>so perfectly cut in half...<8> <38>It almost makes me nervous!<6><16>
KO FreeF MoonJPN <110>GAHAHA!<680> <214>That's the ticket!<15> The full moon is the most impactful of them all! Go big or go home, right?! <649>Seeing the moon all round like that<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214>It's like some fine cheese, and that helps me sleep well!<6> <41><42>!
KO FreeF MoonJPN <110>GAHAHA!<680><13> That reminds medid you know the moon has a different name each day? <18>If you want to meet the same moon you met today<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><616>you gotta wait almost a whole month! <25><2289>Moon facts!
