ZK ApD Stay Hey, <28>I told you recently how I was thinking of moving out of town,<1172> right?<619> <13>Well, I've changed my mind! Someone said something REALLY nice to me, and it made me think about <107> in a new way. <44>So I'm sticking around, and I think it might be nice if we hung out more, <70>, OK?

ZK ApD Stay So I was thinking of moving away from town. Folks here just didn't seem to get me. <44>Then <802> said I should stick around, so I'm giving <107> another chance! <214>Maybe I'm the one who needs to make more of an effort to be friends. <36>I'm a bit of an odd duck, you know.<619> <31>Uh, <1172>but no offense to ducks of course, <42>!
ZK ApD Stay <28>So did I tell you that I was thinking of moving out of town? <3142> I felt like I didn't fit in here, <42>. <13>But the thing is, <37681> told me I should stick with it a little longer. So I am! Hey, and I just wanted to say <18>let's try to be better friends, <70>.<30>I know I'm a little, <1172>well, <1172>quirky. <13>But I'm turning over a new leaf, and I wanted to be sure to tell you!
ZK ApD Stay So I told you I was thinking of moving out of town, didn't I? Sorry if I didn't. I know I'm not always the most perky neighbor around here. That's sort of what I'm getting to though.<1172>.<1172>. <13>I've decided to stay! You see, <802> told me to try a little harder here in <107>. I just wanted to tell you, so I hope we can be good friends, <70>. <40>I'll try my best, at least!
