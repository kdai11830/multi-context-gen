NPC Cafe Racket Oh, hey,<8> <439>!<680> Thanks for always listening to my little brother. I 'preciate it a lot.
NPC Cafe Racket Hello there,<8> <439>!<680> Nice to see ya again!
NPC Cafe Racket Hey, hey,<8> <439>!<680> It seems like we're always here around the same time! You a big coffee fan?
NPC Cafe Racket You know,<670> I'm a firm believer that a coffee shop should be judged primarily on its house blend. By the way, the <375>blended coffee <375><375>Brewster <375>makes <18>is definitely the best! There's no question!
NPC Cafe Racket I just think it's a shame to add milk to the coffee <375>Brewster<375> makes here.<680> I absolutely <375>don't put any <375>in mine.
NPC Cafe Racket Coffee is fine when it's bitter,<670> but I usually put <375>3 spoonfuls <375>of sugar in my cup. I've got a theory sweet coffee helps relax your body and mind better than the bitter stuff.
NPC Cafe Racket <375>Sonny<375> nags you all the time,<8> doesn't he?<6> Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. <375>Sonny<375>'s a handful. <16>But you know,<8> usually he's always dwelling on something whenever he's by himself. <53>I think he's getting really stressed out about the gap between his job and the changing social trends<8>.<8>.<8>.<16>
NPC Cafe Racket <375>Sonny <375>and I are brothers,<670> but even though we eat the same things,<8> we look completely different. My guess is it has a lot to do with the WAY he eats stuff.<30>When I eat,<8> <18>I chew slowly to relish my food,<16> but when he eats,<8> he's <561>exactly the opposite<8>.<8>.<8>. <31>He shovels food into his mouth and chokes it down without chewing properly. <36>He's like a competitive eater!<680> It can't be good for him.<30><16>Eating fast can be hard on your digestive system.<6> It doesn't do a body good at all!<8>
NPC Cafe Racket It's nice to have a place like this to enjoy a cup of coffee and relax in.<6> <18>I'm very grateful! <16>Our bodies would break down if we were all constantly stressed out,<8> never takin' time to relax. If we don't calm down once in a while, we're all headin' for an early retirement. <36>And I don't mean that as a happy sort of retirement, if you get my drift. <38>I'm talkin' dirt nap!<670><16> Yeah, let that sink in. Maybe you'll relax a bit more. You hearin' me? That's what I thought.
