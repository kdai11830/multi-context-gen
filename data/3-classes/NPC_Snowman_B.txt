If you bring me <375>3 snowflakes<375>, I shall give you a reward worthy of your efforts.<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Oh my! I<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I see you're already well acquainted with this whole <375>snowflake<375> business, aren't you?<30>Would you be willing to part with yours?<796><797> Here you go! Sorry, no.
NPC Snowman B <1152>Oh my! I wonder who made this perfectly sculpted figure of mine!<30>Was it<8>.<8>.<8>.<15>you?<30>This is wonderful! How did you get to be so skilled?<30>Oh! One with your talents would surely be able to help a little snow lady with a tiny favor, right? Would you be willing to help me find <375>snowflakes<375>? It's become quite the delightful hobby for me! Their sparkles fill my heart with joy, so I've been collecting them.<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<6>Oh?<15> I see you're no stranger to <375>snowflakes<375><8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30>If you can find and bring me <375>3 <375><375>snowflakes<375>, I will reward you handsomely. I have high hopes for you! Good luck on your search!
NPC Snowman B Yaaaaaawn<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> Oh?<619> How long have I been asleep?<30>Oh my!<6> This perfect balance of head and body<8>.<8>.<8>.<30> <1075>I'm PERFECT!<30><286>To be able to make me so beautiful is an amazing talent. You are so obviously gifted<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Oh, yes! Perhaps one so blessed in the art of snow crafting can do a small favor for me? Would you get some <375>snowflakes<375> for me?<30>Collecting those sparkling beauties has become my life's purpose.<30>If you bring me <375>3 <375>flakes, I will give you something wonderful! Please, I beg you. Make my wish come true<8>.<8>.<8>.<15>
NPC Snowman B Yaaaaawn<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> Are you the one who made me?<30>The balance between head and body is excellent! I owe you my gratitude!<30>Pardon me for saying, but you have quite an impressive set of sparkling <375>snowflakes<375> there! I can never resist the twinkle of a <375>snowflake<375>!<30>Would you be willing to part with those? If you give me <375>5<375> of them, I'll give you something good!<796><797> Sure! Nope.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! This head! This body. You put me together so well!<30>I'm very pleased you made me with such beauty and refinement!<30>Pardon my inquisitiveness, but you wouldn't happen to have any <375>snowflakes<375> on you, would you?<30> How beautiful! Snowflake collecting is actually a hobby of mine.<30>If you bring me <375>snowflakes<375>, I'll reward you with something nice! But 1 or 2 flakes won't do! I'd like you to collect <375>5<375> for me. Can I count on you? I'll be looking forward to it!
NPC Snowman B Well, how do you do? My, you're quite the craftsperson, aren't you? You made me so beautiful! This balance of head and body<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> It's quite excellent! You really know what you're doing! I have a favor to ask of someone who's so handy with snow!<30>Would you bring me some <375>snowflakes <375>for my collection?<30>Those delicate, translucent gifts of winter<8>.<8>.<8>.<619> I just love to collect them!<30>If you bring me <375>5<375>, I'll give you something valuable in return.<619> I shall be waiting here.
NPC Snowman B Well, good day! My name is <375>Snowmam<375>. It's such a pleasure to meet you! If you don't mind me saying, you have such an interesting sense of balance<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>Quite frankly, I had a bad feeling while you were rolling me up!<30>I was trying to tell you, "Bigger!" and "Smaller!" and the like.<30>But I suppose those cries from my simple snow heart fell on deaf ears.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! Are you the one who made me?<619> Thank you very much!<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<6>But to be honest, I would have appreciated a little more balance in my form.<30>You must understand, the beauty of a snowperson is entirely dependent upon the hands of the creator. Next time you make me, I'd like it if you could keep my head slightly smaller than my body<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
NPC Snowman B <1152>What?!<286><6><1152> What is this?!<30>Such imbalance! Such mismatched sphereocity! I'll be the laughingstock of the entire town! <286>Hey! Did you just laugh? Do you think this is funny? Might I remind you that this is your handiwork? <1152>Ugh! Fine! Laugh all you want!<30>I'll just be that weird-looking snowlady people make fun of!
NPC Snowman B Oh! Good day!<619> Um<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> My head is<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> a bit off, is it not?<30> Ugh! Did you even pay attention when you were making me?!<30> You are my creator!<6> Do something!<30> <1075>Aaaarghh<286><1075><29057><286>I was momentarily overcome with frustration. That was very immature of me. I know it's too late to do anything about it.<30>Thank you for making me, but please do be careful the next time you stack snowballs.
NPC Snowman B Oh my! You seem to have what I want. You don't even have to say anything. I can just tell! You know how much I like <375>snowflakes<375>, don't you?<30>How about a trade? You give me snowflakes, and I give you something nice in return! What do you say?<796><797> Here you go! Nope.
NPC Snowman B Oh! My <375>snowflake<375> senses are tingling!<30>So if you do have any snowflakes and I think you domay I have them?<619> I'll give you something nice!<796><797> Here you go! Nope.
NPC Snowman B So you'll give me <375>3 <375><375>snowflakes<375>?
NPC Snowman B So you'll give me <375>5 <375><375>snowflakes<375>?

NPC Snowman B <15>My oh my! I am so happy!<30>This fragile beauty<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <375>Snowflakes<375> really are my favorite things in all the world! Thanks to you, my collection has grown.<30>As a token of my appreciation, please accept this<8> <834>.<30>You can find it in your pockets!
NPC Snowman B <15>Mmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Wonderful! This will forever remain in my heart!<30>This delicate sparkle is truly a winter jewel, a miracle of Mother Nature.<30>I give you my heartfelt gratitude along with your reward.<30>Search your pockets. You'll find <77><834>!
NPC Snowman B Could it be that you're a <375>snowflake<375> collector too?<619> That's too bad<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman B No? Well, let me know if you change your mind.
NPC Snowman B Please let me know if you collect any more. I'll be waiting for you!
NPC Snowman B Please bring more when you get a chancepreferably before I melt! I'm counting on you!
NPC Snowman B Sadly, snowperson season is coming to an end.<30>It may be difficult to collect snowflakes<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman B I have quite a weakness for <375>snowflakes<375><8>.<8>.<8>.<30>If you bring me <375>3<375>, I will give you something very nice.

NPC Snowman B Pardon me! Would you mind looking for <375>snowflakes<375> for me?<30>The trick to finding them is to walk around and use your keen eyes.<30>I'm sure they'll come flying from out of nowhere!<30>You must then seize the moment and catch them with your <375>net<375>!<30>I know you can do it!<619> Good luck!
NPC Snowman B Have you already met my sons?<30>There's <375>Snowtyke<375>, who can't stand to be away from his family<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30>And then there's <375>Snowboy<375>, a growing boy who's always full of energy<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>They're both wonderful children!
NPC Snowman B I'd like to stay around forever, but with a change in the weather<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I'll be off to new adventures!

NPC Snowman B Starting today, I will be staying in town for a while. Please stop by for a chat every now and then.
NPC Snowman B A woman's beauty lies within<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I'd like for everyone to see that there's more to me than just snow!
NPC Snowman B It is the era for women to become independent<6> and go out into society!<30>Oh? That's been the case for a while now?<30>Hmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I'd really like to experience<6> being a woman in the workforce.

NPC Snowman B I would actually like to have friends who are mothersgirls I can talk to about snowgirl things.<30>Even snowpeople have problems.
NPC Snowman B Are you curious about the bun on my head? You are welcome to touch it. It's only a snowball<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman B "Beauty is only snow deep."<619> Are you familiar with this saying?
NPC Snowman B Remember, always try to make snowpeople as handsome or beautiful as you can!
NPC Snowman B Hot! It's hot! I'd love an ice-cold iced tea right now.
NPC Snowman B The snow has melted quite a bit, hasn't it?
NPC Snowman B This unbearable heat<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I don't think I can take anymore! Someone turn on the air conditioner! Hmm? You use them inside? That's a shame<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Snowman B Yaaaaaaawn<8>.<8>.<8>.<619> Spring is a sleepy season, isn't it?
NPC Snowman B The season for snowpeople has come to an end<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>I hope to see you next winter! I must be going soon!
