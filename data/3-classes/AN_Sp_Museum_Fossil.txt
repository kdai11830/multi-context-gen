AN Sp Museum_Fossil <26>Dude! Look at all the space in here!<30><53>We're gonna need some crazy-big fossils to fill this place up, right? <6><41><42>?
AN Sp Museum_Fossil <13>It makes me feel good when I go to a museum in another town and they have less stuff than we have! <44>Course it's not polite to let it show. But that doesn't stop me from grinning on the inside, <6><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fossil <18>Just one would be cool, but having this many fossils is amazing!<30><44>Even I could learn a thing or two by studying the power these fossils hold, <6><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fossil <28>Who decides how to pose the fossils?<15> <18>Whoever it is does a really good job!<30><13>They look like they could leap out at ya at any second! <6><41><42>!

AN Sp Museum_Fossil <18>Wow, so <107> has enough buried fossils that the museum needs a whole room for 'em? <16>I kinda think they could use a few more, but I'm gonna keep checking back, <6><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fossil <18>Man, just imagine these things stomping around ancient <107>!<30><13>I bet they visited your town too! Rrrraawwrr! <6><41><42>!

AN Sp Museum_Fossil <18>Man, so all the fossils in here were walking around and stuff in ancient times. With skin on, I mean<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <87>Just thinking about it gets my heart racing! <6><41><42>!
