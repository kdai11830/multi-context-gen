NPC Haniwa Thank you for coming!<619> I'm lending out various items to support your playtime here on the island!
NPC Haniwa If ever you need these items, oh, do feel free to let me know absolutely anytime, my wondrous buddy!
NPC Haniwa Here it is, my good chum!<30>Oh my, don't worry about bringing it back, as I'll collect it before you leave on a tour or go back to town.
NPC Haniwa Here it is, my pleasant associate!<30>Don't worry about bringing it back. I'll just automatically collect it as soon as the tour is over.
NPC Haniwa Welcome to dreamy <107>!<30>I have oh so many goods, so you can do a bit of this and a bit of that and just have a truly great dream!

NPC Haniwa Here you go, my dear friend!<30>The goods will disappear once you awaken from your dream, so do not worry about returning them!

NPC Haniwa Oh? What shall we talk about then?&#xF;<942><1099><1418> Wet suit. Fishing rod. Net. Axe. Shovel. I changed my mind.
NPC Haniwa The <375>wet suit <375>is a special item used to go free diving in the ocean!<30>Simply slip on the <375>wet suit <375>and press when you're on the beach to hop into the ocean. <16>While in the sea, press to swim in the direction you find yourself pointing. If you see a shadow in the sea,<1172> use to dive and chase after it!<30>If you successfully catch up to it, you'll get one of the ocean's many fantastic treasures! <16>But beware, because jellyfish also appear from time to time, and you really don't want to grab a jellyfish.<1172> Please be careful, and avoid getting stung by a jellyfish, OK?
NPC Haniwa The <375>fishing rod <375>is exactly what it sounds like! You can use it to have ever so much fun while fishing. If you see the shadow of a fish in the water, aim near it and press to send your bobber out. Once the fish takes the bait and you see the bobber splash and go under completely,<8> tap once to reel it in! <214>You must do this quickly so the fish<670> doesn't get away! Patience!<8> I wish you the best of luck, my fishy chum!
NPC Haniwa The <375>bug net <375>is just what it sounds like! You can use it to have quite a glorious time catching bugs. If you see a nice bug, you can try to catch it by simply swinging your net with a tap of ! <214>Let me give you a little hint, though. If a bug is just sitting on a flower or the trunk of a tree... why, just hold down and sneak up on the insect before capturing it with your mighty net!
NPC Haniwa The <375>axe<375> is used to chop down trees!<30>Honestly, we'd really rather you not go around chopping down all of our lovely island's trees<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. but if there's just no dissuading you, please feel free to borrow the <375>axe <375>from me, my choppy mate. Trees bow to you when you equip the <375>axe<375>. Repeatedly tap while facing them. Timber!
NPC Haniwa You can use the <375>shovel<375> to dig holes, bury items, and discover wonderful, new things just waiting to be found! When you want to dig a hole, look for some soft ground and then just press to dig in! The ground will look a little strange if something is buried underneath, so keep a sharp eye out for secrets!
NPC Haniwa Oh, heavens! That wraps up my hearty explanation!<619> So would you like to borrow something now?<8740><1099>( I want to borrow! Item explanation! Some other time.
