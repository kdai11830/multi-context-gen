NPC Gardening <616>Come again!
NPC Gardening <214>Welcome!
NPC Gardening <8>.<8>.<8>.<8><26><670>Oh!<670> A first-timer!
NPC Gardening <141> Welcome!<6> I sell flowers here. Nice, beautiful flowers, yes indeed!<30>I also have <1172>saplings, tools, and many more things, <214>so please do take your time and have a look around.
NPC Gardening <26> Ah!<680> <16>Heya heya, if it isn't <1172><3432> <439>!
NPC Gardening Were you... <1172><28>perhaps a little surprised to see me here?<619> <214> Ah, isn't this place simply happy? <219><375>Timmy<375> and <375>Tommy<375> said they were going to make their shop bigger, so I had them include me too. <16>Since the shop is larger and all now, I thought I'd expand my inventory.<30>Oh yes, <25> I've also decided to start up a <375>weed-pulling service<375>.<30><214>I've given this place a lot of, you could say, "power-ups," so I hope you really like the improvements!
NPC Gardening <26> Oh!<680> <16>Heya heya,<1172> <3432> <439>!<30><219>I know this will seem real sudden, but today's the end of the line for my little shop here. <212>I heard the supermarket next door starts construction tomorrow, so it seemed like pretty good timing! <214>Anyway, if there's something you need,<1172> make sure you buy it today!
NPC Gardening <26> Ah!<680> <16>Heya heya,<1172> <3432> <439>!<30><16>You might have already heard the news, but when T.I.Y. closes its doors tonight, it closes for good. <219>That means today is the last day for the gardening corner too<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>If you need something,<1172> make sure to pick it up today!
NPC Gardening Oh, looks like it's time to close shop for the day.<619> <24547>Please come again once the gardening mood strikes!
NPC Gardening Let's see here. That's a happy <834><24603> <24605> Ah yes! Right!<670> It's <375><863><24468> Bells<375>!<619> Are you<28> <24609><849><8740><1705> Yes please! What is it? No, thanks.
NPC Gardening OK. That's all right.<670> <214>Let me know if you change your happy little mind!
NPC Gardening <214>Wahoo! That makes me so happy!<619> <26>Oops,<18844>#xE;it's <375><863><24468> Bells<375>, so you're a bit short on cash...
NPC Gardening <214>Wahoo! Happy!<619> <26>Uh-oh, <21193>#xE;you haven't got any room in your pockets. Could you make space and come back?
NPC Gardening <214>Wahoo! Thank you!
NPC Gardening <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>So then, what will it be? <28> Still interested in buying the <834><18870><849><796><797> I'll get it! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening If you get an <375>axe<375>, you can chop down trees. WHACK!<30><214>Equip it in your <375>pockets<375> window. Then face a tree and choppy<1172> chop by pressing to swing the axe.
NPC Gardening That's a <375>watering can<375>.<30><367>Watering wilted flowers will perk them right up, making them produce much-needed color around town. <214>Equip it in your <375>pockets<375> window. Face a flower, and press . It really is that simple to water flowers!
NPC Gardening <214><41><77><834><1330> isn't something you'll plant outside. You actually display it inside your home!
NPC Gardening Oh, <77><834> is a seedling that you'll plant outside. It's a low-lying shrub. <367>Planting a variety of shrubs means you get to enjoy beautiful, happy flowers each and every season.
NPC Gardening Oh yes. You see, beautiful flowers will end up blooming from this <834>. <214>Just pull it out and plant it in the ground to grow a single bunch of flowers for the town to see!
NPC Gardening With <77><834>, you can plant a happy new tree out in the town somewhere. <214>All you have to do is choose it from your <375>pockets<375> window to plant it, so it's really super easy! <16>Oh, you do have to be careful not to plant it in the shade or too close to other trees as it won't grow then.
NPC Gardening <214>What you have there is <375>fertilizer <375>for your flowers and fruit trees.<30><16>Use your shovel to bury it next to trees and flowers you want to grow strong and happy, then leave it be! <367>It makes growing pretty flowers and super-yummy fruit really easy!
NPC Gardening That is exactly what it looks like <375>bamboo<375>.<619> Sure you can eat it, but my intent was to have it grown outside. <214>All you have to do is plant it from your <375>pockets<375> when you're outdoors, same as a tree. Easy! <16>Oh,<1172> but you must be careful not to plant it too close to another tree or in the shade, or else it will die!
NPC Gardening It's exactly what it looks like. It's a <375>persimmon<375>!<30>Sure, you can eat it, but my intent was to have it grown outside.<30><214>All you have to do is plant it from your <375>pockets<375> when you're outside, so it's easylike a tree! <16>But<1172> you gotta be careful not to plant it too close to another tree or in the shade. <31>Doing that will cause it to wither, and then it'll never grow up all big!
NPC Gardening <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><26> Oh! Of course!<670> You'd probably like to get to shopping!
NPC Gardening <8>.<8>.<8>.<670><23><670>Oh, that's right!
NPC Gardening <16>It's a <375>silver can<375>! You can use it to water many plants at once.<30><219><41><439>, you've bought a lot of flower seeds here<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>So use the watering can to help make those flowers nice and happy!
NPC Gardening It's a <375>golden axe<375>. It's so strong it won't break, no matter how many trees you chop down! <31>Oh, but wait!<670> I'm not trying to give you the suggestion to chop through a bunch of trees! <219><41><439>, you've bought a lot of saplings from me<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>So use that axe wisely to make <107> the most beautiful town this world has ever seen!
NPC Gardening <16>It's a <375>golden shovel<375>! If you use it when burying fertilizer, it makes it extra potent. Well worth the effort! <219>Now, <439>, I know you've picked up more than your share of fertilizer from me<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <214>So I hope you'll use that shovel to help make the flowers and trees around town as happy as can be!
NPC Gardening <214>Hold up, <439>.<8> Your purchase today comes with a happy bonus!
NPC Gardening <214>If you find something in the store you have questions about,<8> please feel free to ask me.
NPC Gardening I change the selection of flowers and saplings daily, based on what sort of happiness I'm feeling. <219>So, I certainly hope that you'll make some time every day to see what I have on display in the shop.
NPC Gardening <214>I'm happiest when I'm just walking around town and happen upon a flower starting to bloom. Stunning!
NPC Gardening I sold out of every single thing I put on display today.<30><141>I'm so happy there are others around here who share my love of pretty flowers and greenery!
NPC Gardening <214>I'm going to do everything I can to finish all the weeding by tomorrow morning. Yes, no later. <16>I hope that you'll take some time in the morning to admire what a happy, weed-free town we'll have.
NPC Gardening The shop! <1172><28> It's lovely, right?<6> <214> And it's so packed with happy products!<30><219><375>Timmy <375>and <375>Tommy<375> said they were expanding the shop, so I had them make a happy little space for me! <214>I've got a lot more floor space for new items, so come by often to see what sort of happy things I'll have!
NPC Gardening Yes,<670> <439>?<1172><28> Can I help you?<849><796><1418> Please weed! Just browsing!
NPC Gardening <26>What?<670> You need someone to weed?<619> <53>But, on my daily walk, I didn't see a single weed anywhere at all<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16><40><1172>Don't worry so much, <3142> <439>!<30><141>Today, <107> is as beautiful as ever. Enjoy that happy sensation!
NPC Gardening <26>What?<670> Weeding?<619> <53>But I didn't see all that many weeds during my walk<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><16><40><1172>Don't worry so much, <439>!<30><141>Today, <107> doesn't look like it's being overrun by weeds one bit, so worry not. Instead, be happy!
NPC Gardening <26>Oh, you need someone to weed?<670> <16>Yeah, I've seen a few sprouting up that do need to be taken care of! <214>If you ask me today, I'll make sure that this town is clean and happy by early tomorrow morning! <16>Taking a look at things, I'd say that <375>10,000 Bells <375>ought to cover it. So, <28> <24666><849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening <26>Oh, you need someone to weed?<670> <16>Yes, I've seen them out there.<1172> I think it's time someone took care of 'em! <214>If you ask me now, I can have this town happy once more by early tomorrow morning! <16>Looking at the way things are, I'd say <375>20,000 Bells <375>ought to cover it. So, <24672> <24666><849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening <26>Oh, you need someone to weed?<670> It's getting pretty bad out there. High time someone did something<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <40>But no worries!<619> <214>If you ask me right now, I should have this town happy again by early tomorrow morning. <16>It's going to be quite a bit of work though, so it will cost a grand total of <375>30,000 Bells<375>. <28> <24681><849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening <26>Oh, you need someone to weed!<670> Ah, yes, I've noticed myself how bad it's getting out there lately<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <214>But, if you ask me right now, I think I should be able to get it all nice and happy by early tomorrow morning. <16>It's pretty bad though, so it's gonna cost ya <375>50,000 Bells<375>. <24688> What do you say to my offer?<849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening <167>What?! You want someone to weed?<670> <31>But this town has been taken over! It's like an unhappy jungle out there! <16><1172> <12737> <24694>#xE; if I do my best, I can restore the town's happiness by early morning. <16>This is going to be a lot of work, so it's going to cost...<375>100,000 Bells<375>! <28> <24701><849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thanks.
NPC Gardening <214>OK,<8> you come back with enough Bells,<8> and I'll be willing to help you with your little weed problem.
NPC Gardening <214>Roger that!<670> I consider the job paid in full, so I'll make sure to get to the job as soon as we close for the day. <16>I know it's an eyesore, but <25>I'll make sure it's neat and tidy for you even before you wake up in the morning! <214>Now THERE'S certainly something to look forward to, eh? Heh heh.
NPC Gardening I see.<619> <214>Well then, come see me again if and when you change your mind.
