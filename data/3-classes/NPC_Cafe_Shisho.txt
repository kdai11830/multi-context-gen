NPC Cafe Shisho The <375>mocha<375> coffee <375>Brewster<375> makes is a huge hit with me!<30>I wish I had a JOKE<670> <38>that was always a hit. Maybe someday<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cafe Shisho I can't stand my coffee tasting too strong, so I always get <375>Brewster <375>to put a <375>little<375> bit of milk in it. <25><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>I don't mind strong jokes, though!<619> <4074><97><50><680><286><375>Aw,<286> <375><22746><286><375><286><286><375><4149><375><286>
NPC Cafe Shisho I actually have a bad sweet tooth, so when I drink coffee,<1172> I always ask for <375>2 <375><375>spoonfuls<375> of sugar. <38>I had my share of bitter experiences back when I told jokes for a living<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Cafe Shisho Ah! Hello there!<6> We meet again!
NPC Cafe Shisho Even though I used to be an emotion comedian, I actually have trouble waking up in the mornings.<1172> Sorry if I don't seem my usual funny self just yet.
NPC Cafe Shisho <682><22756><686>
NPC Cafe Shisho Oh! Good morning!<6> <13>It feels good out there in the nice weather, yeah?
NPC Cafe Shisho Oh! Good morning!<6> It's kind of cloudy out there today. Bummer.
NPC Cafe Shisho Oh! Good morning!<6> It seems we're starting the day off with some rain.
NPC Cafe Shisho Oh! Good morning!<6> Today is really cold! Time to bundle up!
NPC Cafe Shisho Oh! Good morning!<6> Today all the cherry blossoms are floating about,<1172> so it looks really beautiful outside!
NPC Cafe Shisho I've gotten completely in the habit of drinking a cup of coffee to wake up <13>before my busy afternoon. <16>My club may be open for business at night, but I have to clean up the place beforehand, you know? <38>Oddly, I think I work harder now than I did back when I was still a full-time comedian<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cafe Shisho Have you ever seen those gyroids up on the stage at the club?<30>It's weird, but I didn't actually put them there.<1172> They just appeared out of the blue one day. How bizarre! <53>And weirder still, I get the feeling that someone is switching them out from time to time<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Cafe Shisho You know, I was only able to open my club thanks to all the support you gave me, Mayor <439>! <13>Every day since the club opened,<1172> my family says a quick thank-you to you and <375>Isabelle<375> at breakfast!
NPC Cafe Shisho You know,<1172> I was only able to open my club thanks to all of the support Mayor <1678> gave me! I didn't just get permission <18>but help collecting the signatures as well<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><13>Every day since the club opened, my family says a quick thank-you to the mayor and <375>Isabelle <375>at breakfast!
NPC Cafe Shisho Back when I was a comedian,<649><670> I'd often spend all night sipping coffee and thinking up new gags in a caf.
NPC Cafe Shisho You know, the other day when <375>K.K. Slider <375>came in,<1172> he was holding a takeout cup from here. I've never run into him here, but I'm guessing he's also a regular?
NPC Cafe Shisho Speaking of coffee, back in the day, I often thought to myself,<30>"I want to tell a joke so funny, it makes the audience spit out their coffee!" <670>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>You know? I was never able to do that. <38>There were times they got mad and chased after me, though<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cafe Shisho I had a teacher who taught me the comedy ropes. Every single one. <30>He's an amazing person who was known in the entertainment world as a master of laughs. <53>It was always my dream to make it big just like him and have people say I surpassed him, but<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16>I retired long before that dream came true.<30><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><28> Hmmm?<6> You're curious what my old teacher <375>Frillard<375> is up to now?<30><214>He's been retired for ages, but he's just as spry as ever!<619> I don't think I'll ever get the best of him!
NPC Cafe Shisho I never quite became popular on a national level, but I still had some fairly passionate fans. Even though I've retired, they still stop by the club before it opens to see how I'm doing<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. Sometimes they even bring me treats, so I'm always so grateful for their continued support. When I tell them one of my old jokes and they smile, <214>it takes me back to my days as a comedian. <38>Heh. I<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>don't get a chance to look back fondly very often<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cafe Shisho You know, lately I've had a lot of youngsters pop into the club before it's open while I'm still cleaning<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30>"I need to take a picture for my <375>TPC<375>, so teach me a funny face!"<30>I hear that's popular at the moment.<6> Having a funny face on your TPC<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<619> <36>I really don't get kids these days.
