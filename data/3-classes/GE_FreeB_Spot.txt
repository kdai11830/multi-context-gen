GE FreeB Spot <13>This looks like a good place to toss around a ball. <44>No buildings means no windows for me to break! Hee hee!
GE FreeB Spot <87>Looks like someone is building a new house in town! <13>Gosh, I hope our new neighbor is totally fun. No-fun neighbors are, like, the pits! And <107> <561>definitely doesn't need any more no-fun neighbors!
GE FreeB Spot <18>My house is, like, so cool. I picked out the colors all by myself. <141>They look totally amazing together! Yup. <319>A house like mine is fit for a superstar! <670>Anything less would be a travesty, <42>.
GE FreeB Spot <28>Do you want to spy on <48>'s house too? <44>Good to know there's another secret agent in <107>! <110>Hee hee! I'm just kidding. I'm no spyat least, not professionally. <18>But I do like to keep tabs on folks!
GE FreeB Spot <40>Living in a tent is, like, totally wild! You're all getting back to nature and stuff. <103>Good for you!
GE FreeB Spot <13>It takes a good eye for design to furnish a house with only one room. <28>Like, where will everything go? You've really got your work cut out for you, <40>but I know you'll do fine. You're more stylish than you think!
GE FreeB Spot <13>I pass by your place all the time when I'm out on a walk. <141>Your house looks good from, like, every angle! <36>Do you know how difficult that is? I'd be a much bigger star if I didn't have a good side AND a bad one.
GE FreeB Spot <214>Your house is, like, totally perfect for parties! <103>Super spacious, so there's room for a dance floor too! Ooh! <87>Promise me if you ever throw a dance party, you'll invite me! Pinky swear, <70>!
GE FreeB Spot <214>Your house is, like, ginormous. <110>I bet you get lost in it all the time, <70>! <28>But for reals, has anyone ever got lost in your house? There could be folks in the walls, <670><42>!
GE FreeB Spot <72>Whoa! <41><802> actually lives in a tent. Not a house with, like, walls. <18>But an honest-to-goodness tent! <649><1006><1533>#x0; <1534>#x0; got a lot of chutzpah, I'll give <989>h<996>#x0;<997><998> that. <40>Maybe <12017>s<1001>#x0; can give me a lesson in bravery, <42>!
GE FreeB Spot <13>I guess <802> would rather add on to <4412>#x0;<991>h<998> house piece by piece and not try to do it all at once. Home renovation can be, like, totally exhausting. <18>But <802> needs to get to work on <4412>#x0;<991>h<998> place!
GE FreeB Spot <8><13><41><802>'s place is, like, the perfect size. Not too big, but not too small! <53>If a house is too big, it's a pain to clean. But if it's too small, <319>there's no room for your pageant trophies!
GE FreeB Spot <561>Ugh! I get total house envy each time I look at <802>'s house, <42>. <87>I mean, can you even imagine the closet space? I can, and I have. <619><354>So much closet space...
GE FreeB Spot <72><41><802> must be some kind of secret celebrity, living in an honest- to-goodness mansion! <36>There are probably paparazzi hiding out just waiting to snap <4412>#x0;<991>h<998> photo!
GE FreeB Spot <13>Every time I go down the slope to the beach, <87>I picture myself strutting down the catwalk like a model!
GE FreeB Spot <25>I need to keep up my status as trendiest <46> in <107>! And there's only one way to do it... <40>I'll just put out a lot of things I recommend at Re-Tail. <103>That way, everyone will see them!
GE FreeB Spot <214>I totally have to see if Re-Tail can make some custom goods for me.<30><87>Can you imagine? A whole product line with the <963> name and image on them, <42>!
GE FreeB Spot <367>Train travel sounds so romantic, don't you think? Just imaginea new day, a new town... But I'd get too lonely traveling all by myself. <619><72>Hey! Maybe you could come with me, <70>!
GE FreeB Spot <649>When I see the blue ocean, all I can picture is a tropical paradise!<30><13>Sandy, white beaches and fruity drinks<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><619> <669>Doesn't that sound, like, totally relaxing?!
GE FreeB Spot My heart beats a little faster every time I walk by the police station<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <561>Not that I'm guilty of anything!
GE FreeB Spot <40>Ahh! Just breathe in that yummers smell of coffee and cream! <36>It's gonna make me droooool... <649>One of these days, I'm gonna sit in the caf and totally get all, like, philosophical with <375>Brewster<375>!
GE FreeB Spot <40>How's everything going down at the town hall? I bet you have a lot of smart people working for you. <18>I'm gonna be a real go-getter one of these days! .<8>.<8>.<8>Just not today.
GE FreeB Spot <53>I've always got a million things to ask <375>Isabelle<375>, <38>but they all fly out of my head when I'm at the town hall!
