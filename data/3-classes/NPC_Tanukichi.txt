If you're interested, please let me know at any time, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <141>Thanks much for paying off all of your home-renovation loan! Yes, yes, thanks much, indeed! <53>Perhaps you paid it off because<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <28>you're dissatisfied with your space limitations, hm? <110>No need to worry! No need at all.<670> <40>I can assist with the enlarging of your house, <439>! <214>Let's chat about the details when you've got some time on your busy hands, hm?

I can help you build the home of your very large dreams! <214>When you wish to discuss the details further, please come find me!
NPC Tanukichi <141>Yes, yes, yes!<1172> You've paid off every bit of your home-renovation loan!<30><16>I'm quite conservative in matters of finance, but I knew you'd take care of this, <214><439>! <25>My faith was such that I drew up plans for more additions after you added a second floor, <439>! <16>I'm confident you'll be quite pleased with these plans. <40>I do hope you'll give them some thought, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <141>Oh, happy day! <1172>You've paid off all your home-renovation loan!<30><53>And your reason for being so very, very diligent is<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <44>No need for words. I can see it in your eyes, hm? <214>Yes, I will gladly engage in further renovation discussions. <1172><40>Come see me anytime! Anytime, indeed!
NPC Tanukichi <141>Thank you much!<1172> You've paid your home-renovation loan in full, which is no small feat, yes, yes! <53>And you did it so fast<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <18>That can only mean <1172>you're a financial wizard!<30><214>Such a magnificent home and zero debt! <110>Your life in <107> will surely be stress free, <439>! <214> <561>I cannot overstate how incredible this accomplishment is! <40>Truly,<1172> it is something remarkable! Yes, yes! <23>In fact, <18>I believe you deserve a reward of sorts. <561>No, no, no such discounts from me, <53>but, hm... <72>Yes! An old song from the Nook family lineage, <25>sung in times of great success to strengthen hearts! <16>Ahem <20476> <20476> <29271>#xE; GL- <29274> <29274> <29278> KEEEH! FST! FST! RrrrrrrrrrrrKLAGH! CH- <29290> ch-ch-mmmMMMmmm! <38>Oh, <29296> it is very old <212>and in the language of my ancestors, <36>which happens to be Raccoonish, yes, yes. <16>Anyway, your home may be at a state of basic completion, <53>but it is far from being done, hm? <18>I do hope you'll continue to improve your home's interior and exterior, yes, yes!<8> I do! <214>If you're in need of advice, please let <375>Lyle<375> or me know, yes? <40>We'll be quite glad to help you out. <16>In fact, <29313>Lyle<375> right away, as I'm sure <616>he'll want to congratulate you as well. <16>Yes, yes! Your continued patronage <40>of <375>Nook's Homes<375> is very much appreciated. Do come again!
NPC Tanukichi Your home has now been built, yes? <28>What do you think? <619><110>Your house is now the stuff of dreams, hm? <214> <16>And now the numbers<8>.<8>.<8>. <619> <53>I deducted your down payment, leaving a grand total of<8>.<8>.<8>. <141><375><863><29319> Bells<375>. That's the total amount of your paltry little loan. A mere trifle, really, yes? <26><670>Hm? <670><16>Oh, no, you don't pay me directly. <214>Please make all of your payments at the <375>post office ABD<375>. And there's no set schedule, either. Pay the loan off at your own pace or whenever you're able, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <24228> <29325> <16>one more thing<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>We do require that all homeowners become members of the <375>Happy Home Academy<375>, hm? They'll just stop by from time to time and give your home an in-depth inspection.<8> Very good to get one. <53>The inspection is a comprehensive look at your room and furniture layout, your hygiene level, et cetera. <214>If you're given high marks, you might even receive a wonderfully elegant commemorative prize! <16>They'll schedule the inspection, so there's nothing for you to worry about. <1172>No worries at all, hm? What else<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <214>Members, you see, also gain access to the <375>HH Showcase <375>behind the shopping district. <16>Once you've received a letter that confirms your membership, you may visit the showcase at any time! <214>Very good. Please do come see me if you wish to discuss further renovations, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Yes, yes! <670><28>How may I help you?<849><796><797> Down payment! Never mind.
NPC Tanukichi Hm? That so?<619> <214>No problem! When you've got your down payment, please do bring it to me here, yes!
NPC Tanukichi <214>You've brought the money?<6> <13>Ah, we Nooks can sense Bells, yes, yes.<8> Old family secret. <53>Now let's just<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><26>hm?<8> <16>But, but, <31><439>!<670> You do not have enough!<8> Not nearly!<30>I need the full <375>10,000-Bell <375>down payment in one lump sum, yes?<30><16>Living in a tent cannot be terribly comfortable, no, no.<670> <214>Wouldn't you prefer a nice warm house, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You brought the money? <53>Let's have us a look, hm?<30><40>Yes! Yes! <6>Exactly <375>10,000 Bells<375>! That does make me rather happy.
NPC Tanukichi <214>Very good, very good! <1172>The money makes everything official, and work on your house can begin at once. <16>You can also choose the color of your newly built home's roof. So what color <1172><28>will it be, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Yes, yes! Got it!<8> I will make sure your house is ready to go by tomorrow morning. <53>What else<8>.<8>.<8>. to tell you<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <23> Oh, yes, yes, of course!<670> <214>I must tell you all about home remodeling! <16>Once your house is finished, I can help you <375>update the exterior<375>!<30>The exterior of your home consists of the things on the outside, such as your roof, door, and fence. <214>Every day I will display new samples here to look through, so you should come when you've grown curious. Well, for the moment you must be looking forward to tomorrow, yes? <6><616>Thanks much!
NPC Tanukichi I'm so sorry! I don't have the right permits to work on homes in towns other than this one. However, if there are any items here you would like, <1172>please let me know, yes? <214>I can contact the realtor in your town and request a single item at a time be made available there too!
NPC Tanukichi <214>Your request will be made available to you right away. I only have to make a few quick phone calls, hm? <16>When you arrive home, be sure to visit your realtor before it closes for the day, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Yes, yes! <670><16>You would like to discuss <1172><28>your home, hm?<796><797> I wanna expand! Never mind.
NPC Tanukichi Oh, really? <619><214>If you have any housing questions, do come see me at any time, hm?
NPC Tanukichi I am truly very sorry, but until your existing loan is paid in full I can accept no new renovation requests. <214>You can pay your loan 24 hours a day at the <375>ABD in the post office<375>.<30>Once it's all paid off, come talk to me again, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214><41><439>? It is time to make your home bigger, yes, yes.<30>A loan of <375><8964><29319> Bells <375>can make this dream a reality. <29363><849><796><797> Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi <53>I've been thinking<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214>You know, your home would be better if it were just a bit bigger, yes, yes.<30>For a piddling <375><8964><29319> Bells<375>, I can make such a thing happen. <29366><849><796><797> Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi <53>Well<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><214>listen, <439>, I believe your home would be oh so cozy if it had a second floor. A smallish loan of <375><8964><29319> Bells <375>would be required of course. <29366><849><796><797> Let's do it! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214><41><439>, wouldn't your house benefit greatly from an addition of some sort? <16>In my own expert opinion, I would suggest the following<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> <28>What do you think, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <53>Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <214><41><439>, your home would be improved much with just a bit more space, yes, yes. <16>And if you decided to expand, may I suggest<8>.<8>.<8>.<670>
NPC Tanukichi <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>. <214>I must say, <439>, your home needs more space or perhaps maybe an extra room, hm? <28>I could of course help with whatever you'd like to do. What do you think?<8740><797> Extra room! More space! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi <214>Yes, yes! So tell me, <1172>where do you want the additional room, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Excellent! So tell me, <1172>which room shall we make larger, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>The new room will be added to the left side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>The new room will be added to the right side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>The new room will be added to the back side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Yes, yes, a basement is what you want, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You want to widen the room on the left side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You want to widen the room on the right side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You want to widen the room on the back side of the first floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You want to widen the basement, do you, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>You want to widen the room on the second floor, hm?
NPC Tanukichi Your loan will come to a total of <375><863><29319> Bells<375>. <28>This is perfectly acceptable, yes?<849><796><797> Let's do it! Um, never mind.
NPC Tanukichi <141>Excellent! <6>I will put your order in right away, hm?<30><214>The work will be fully completed by tomorrow morning. I'm so sure you must be very excited, yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi <214>How do you like your current living arrangements? <619>I'm always here for exterior-renovation consultation!
NPC Tanukichi I'm terribly sorry, <439>, but your house cannot be made any larger. It's simply not possible. <214>However, there are changes you can make to the exterior. I recommend you consider your options, hm?
NPC Tanukichi I'm very sorry, but I do not offer loans for exterior renovations, hm?<30>But, <439>! Compared to your previous home loans, <214>the price is nothing but a drop in the bucket!
NPC Tanukichi Your home has now been updated,<1172> <28>has it not?<619> <214>Yes, yes, I believe that it looks quite different. I think you will feel like you are living a brand-new life!<8> Also <20476> <20476> .
NPC Tanukichi <214><41><439>! Your house will be all finished in the morning. <670>This is so thrilling, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214><41><439>, your addition will be completed in the morning! <1172>I daresay you may have trouble sleeping, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214><41><439>, construction will be completed in the morning! <1172>I can hardly wait to see it myself, hm?
NPC Tanukichi Your renovations <28>are complete, yes? <619><214>It may be but a small change, but I trust you are pleased, hm?
NPC Tanukichi Your house <28>is much roomier, yes?<619> <214>I hope you find it adds to your quality of life, my friend! Yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi <214>Your home is now a magnificent two stories high, hm?<30>With an additional floor, you have much space to fill, <18>and I'm sure it will bring you joy to fill it, yes, yes!<214>
NPC Tanukichi Your addition <28>is finished, hm?<619> <214>Oh, <439>, my friend, your home is that much homier now. Yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi Did you <28>look around your house?<619> <214>I daresay you'll not find many that equal such fine workmanship, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <16>So<8>.<8>.<8>. it's time for business numbers.<30>Yes, yes, the trifling cost of your addition comes to <909><141><23503> Bells<375>.<670> Pocket change, really. <1172><26> No, no!<670> I can't accept your money here! <214>Please make your payments at the <375>post office ABD<375>, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <616>Much thanks in advance, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <16>And, <1172><439>, by the wayyour house is as large as we can make it. We cannot build it any larger. <616>I trust this new information is all perfectly clear, hm? <1172>Thanks much!
NPC Tanukichi <23><670>Oh!<619> That reminds me, <439><8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a special sample used for exterior renovations. However, <439>, as you are preparing to do some construction, <214>you may purchase it afterward.
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is an exclusive sample used for exterior renovations, yes? But your house is not yet finished, <439>. You may purchase it once construction is done, hm?<214>
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used for door renovations.
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used for roof renovations.
NPC Tanukichi That <834> is a sample used for exterior renovations. If you make the order, we can then renovate your house, just like the model shows! Yes, yes! <214>By the way,<1172> things like the color of your home's roof or siding will not be changed in the renovation. <7>That sort of thing requires more work, <110>and we're not a charity!
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is an excellent sample used for exterior aesthetic changes, hm? <214>Make your house bigger, <439>, and then we can make large-scale renovations as well! <13>Yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used when replacing your mailbox, yes?
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used when doing work on your fence, yes?
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used for renovating your exterior walls, hm?
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used for renovating your paving stones, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <41><77><834>?<619> <214>If memory serves, <439>, you have the same door on your house.
NPC Tanukichi <41><77><834>, hm?<619> <214>If memory serves, <439>, you have the same roof on your house.
NPC Tanukichi <41><77><834>, yes?<619> <214>If memory serves me, <439>, your house has the same exterior.
NPC Tanukichi Ah, <77><834>?<619> <214>If memory serves, <439>, your mailbox is identical to this one.
NPC Tanukichi <41><77><834>, hm?<619> <214>If memory serves, <439>, you have the same fence at your house.
NPC Tanukichi Oh, <77><834>?<619> <214><41><439>, if memory serves, your house has the same exterior.
NPC Tanukichi <41><834>, yes, yes?<619> <214>If memory serves, <439>, your paving stones are identical to these.
NPC Tanukichi The cost is <375><863><24468> Bells<375>. <28>Would you perchance be interested, hm?<849><796><797> I'll buy! No, thanks.
NPC Tanukichi I see<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <214>No worries, no worries.<1172> Still plenty left to look at, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <40>Thanks much! <6><16>Um<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <28>Hm?<30>But you...<1172>you don't have enough money, no, no!<30><16>As I said, I do not make loans for exterior renovations. <214>You clearly understand this, yes?
NPC Tanukichi <40>Thanks much!<30><16>I will help make all of the necessary arrangements, and...<619><214>everything will be completed tomorrow! Exciting!
NPC Tanukichi Hm. <41><77><834>. But you do not live in this town, so<1172> I cannot accept your order, no. I can contact the realtor in your town <1172>and arrange for the item to be available there. <28>What do you think?<849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thank you.
NPC Tanukichi Yes, <77><834>. But I can only contact your town about a single item at a time. I can, however, make a request that this item replace the item we talked about earlier. <28>What do you think?<849><796><797> Yes, please! No, thank you.
NPC Tanukichi Very well, I understand.<6> <214>Please do not hesitate <1172>to tell me if there's anything you wish to request.
NPC Tanukichi <214>Understood. I'll arrange for the item to be available in your town's real- estate office when you return home. <16>Once you arrive, please do stop by your realtor before they close for the day, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <214>Very good! I will cancel your prior request and see to it that this item is sent to your realtor instead!
NPC Tanukichi That <834><1330> is a sample used for exterior renovations, yes? <214>This is but one way owners of large homes can change their style in just a snap!
NPC Tanukichi <1172><26> Oh, that's right.<670> You were busy with your shopping, were you not?
NPC Tanukichi <214>I have, of course, completed running the numbers on your home loan, <439>, yes, yes. <16>Now let us discuss the cost<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><53>You know, <439>, we can't build you a house unless you have all necessary costs covered, hm? <141>So the down payment is nothing more than a paltry <375>10,000 Bells<375>.<849><796><797> Let's do it! I can't afford that!
NPC Tanukichi Very good!<8> Though,<1172> we can't break ground on your home until your down payment is received, hm?
NPC Tanukichi <26>No, no?!<670> <214>That's fine! <1172>You're fine!<670> You needn't worry about giving me a single Bell at this point in time! <87>I'm quite a generous raccoon! <6>My heart is about the size of a four- bedroom, two-bath duplex, hm? <16>That being said<8>.<8>.<8>. I do need your down payment before any work can be done on your home. OK?
NPC Tanukichi <110>But do not worry!<8> No, no!<6> <214>This town is rich in crops and other resources. You'll find it easy to earn money! <53>You can collect <375>fruit <375>and <375>seashells <375>and take them to the <375>recycling shop<375> to earn quick cash, yes? <16>Once you've saved a bit, buying a <375>net <375>or <375>fishing rod <375>at the <375>store<375> is a good idea as well. It is indeed! <214>You can use such tools to go forth and catch <909>insects <375>and <375>fish <375>to sell too. An easy path to riches, hm? <110>Much faster than searching for low-paying, part-time employment, yes?<214> Oh yes, yes! <16>So come and see me right away <29455>10,000 Bells<375>.<619> <214>Good luck, good luck!
NPC Tanukichi <1172><26> Oh!<619> <214><41><439>, yes, yes, welcome!<619> <16>Have you finished<28> everything you needed to do to move in?
NPC Tanukichi <28>So you would like <77><834><29457><849><796><797> Yes, yes! Hold it!
NPC Tanukichi <214>Then I shall ask again, and you shall pick the roof color that sounds good to you, yes, yes!
NPC Tanukichi <214><41><439>, that happens to be the same part that you have currently placed a construction order for! <16>There is no changing or canceling construction orders! No, no!<30>If you want to place another order for that same part, I am sorry, but you will have to do it another day!
NPC Tanukichi Ah, the <834> here will be used in your house remodel scheduled for tomorrow. <214>The remodel should be done by tomorrow morning, so look forward to it, yes, yes!
