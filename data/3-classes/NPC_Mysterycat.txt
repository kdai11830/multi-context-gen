NPC Mysterycat Are you having fun playing with all the tricksters on <375>April Fools' Day<375>?<30><294>Today,<375><2841>I'll make myself look like various people in town<375><375> and pay them all a <40>surprise visit!<670><30><26>Eh?!<680> Think I was lying just now?<619> <110>Hee hee! <6>If that's what you think, come and watch the fun in a bit!<680><16> Let's see <6><53>whose house I should pick for my first trick of the day<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><72>Oh!<680> And remember, <18>when the ticket gates are open or you have a visitor, the surprise has to be postponed!<670><16> Then <616>let's get this going!
NPC Mysterycat <8>.<8>.<8>.<8>Or<1172> I would,<670> <121>but it's already too late to start now!<670><16><30><36>Well, I guess you'll have to wait until next year to enjoy the fun!
NPC Mysterycat <18>You've got a good eye for tricks!<30><36>I thought I was the master of disguise<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><110>But it looks like you've got skills even greater than mine to see through my tricks and traps!<680><16> <128>Well, don't get cocky! You might have had the upper hand this year, but that doesn't always last! <214>Just be prepared for next year,<670> 'cause I'll be coming back strong!
NPC Mysterycat I was gonna surprise you, but you ended up <36>finding me every single time without fail<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <31>How did you manage to do that?! <248>I worked so hard to fool everyone, and you saw right through me! <128>Did you cheat? I bet you cheated! There's no other way around it!<30> <12737> I'm sorry. That was rude of me.<16> I've just got to admit <616>you're the real master of disguise!
NPC Mysterycat My disguise was pretty good, huh?<30><214>People in town seemed to like my little surprise,<670> <40>so I'm rather happy!
NPC Mysterycat I should polish my skills more<25> so everyone will enjoy my fun prank again next year too!
NPC Mysterycat <18>You've got a pretty good eye!<30><36>And I was so confident in my disguise skills too<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
NPC Mysterycat <44>That was pretty entertaining, right?<680> <36>Though I'm a little bummed you saw through my disguises.
NPC Mysterycat Hey there!<6> <28>Do you know what day today is?<30><214>Yep, yep!<670> It's <375>April Fools' Day<375>, the day of tricks and pranks!<680><30><294>I have a big surprise prepared for everyone in town today<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><16>Once the ticket gates are closed and the town isn't hosting any guests,<670> I can carry out my plan! <36>My prank is pretty sneaky, but I don't want anyone to interrupt it!<30><16>Remember,<8> when <375> <375>is showing on the bottom left of the screen...<30>it means <561>wireless communication is still activated, so people might decide to butt in! <36>I don't mind if best friends want to chat with you and such, just as long as they stay at home! <214>If you need to shut that down,<8> talk to <375>Porter <375>at the station to stop all that wireless communicating!
NPC Mysterycat <214>Today<8> tricks are everywhere and pranks are plentiful!<30><38>Although,<8> compared to me,<8> all other tricksters and pranksters are just rank amateurs!
NPC Mysterycat <28>Huh?<680> <38>Are you thinking about playing a trick on ME, by any chance?!<30><110>There's no way I would fall for any tricks by amateurs!<214> Anyway,<8> I have quite a big surprise for everyone! <87>I'll show you once the ticket gates are closed and no one's visiting the town! <16>Remember,<8> when <375><375> <8>is showing on the bottom left of the screen...<30><561>that means wireless communication hasn't been deactivated!<30>I can't have visitors coming in and messing up my scheme, can I?<30><36>If you really want to chat with best friends or something, that's fine, <128>as long as they stay at home! <214>If you need to,<8> talk to <375>Porter <375>to put a stop to wireless communication!
NPC Mysterycat I'll take a rest until the ticket gates are closed and we don't have any visitors in town. <214>You'll see my surprise continue when the gates are closed!<30><16>One thing to note:<8> when <375> <375><8>is showing on the bottom left of the screen... <561>it means wireless communication hasn't yet been deactivated.<30><214>In that case,<8> just talk to <375>Porter <375>to end the communication!<30><36>I really don't mind if you still want to chat with best friends, <128>but I can't have anyone interrupting my prank! <214>Chat wirelessly, but make them stay at home!
NPC Mysterycat I'll take a rest until the ticket gates are closed and we don't have any visitors in town. <214>You'll see my surprise continue when the gates are closed!<30><16>One thing to note:<8> when <375> <375><8>is showing on the bottom left of the screen... <561>it means wireless communication hasn't yet been deactivated.<30><214>In that case,<8> just talk to <375>Porter <375>to end the communication!<30><36>I really don't mind if you still want to chat with best friends, <128>but I can't have anyone interrupting my prank! <214>Chat wirelessly, but make them stay at home!
NPC Mysterycat <28>Huh?<670> Someone's locked themselves up in their home and won't talk to anyone right now?<16> <38>I have NO idea why they'd do something like that...
NPC Mysterycat Tricks abound today!<30><87>I'll get back to my surprise once the gates are closed and all the visitors are out of town again! <16>Just remember,<8> when <375><375> is showing on the bottom left of the screen... <561>it means wireless communication isn't deactivated yet, and I can't have visitors distracting me! <36>You can still chat with best friends though. I don't mind that. <128>It's just the town visits that have to stop! <214>If you need to,<8> talk to <375>Porter <375>to end the communication!
NPC Mysterycat I'm the fake one!<6> <31>That's a bummer!<680> You figured out it was me! I was sure my disguise was perfect!
NPC Mysterycat I'm the fake one!<6> <36>Darn it. What gave me away?
NPC Mysterycat I'm the fake one!<6> <36>Aw, man. You knew it was me<6> even though I had such a great disguise on.
NPC Mysterycat I'm the fake one!<6> <31>That's no fun!<6> You saw right through my disguise each and every time!
NPC Mysterycat <0><1><2><98>You've got a pretty good eye!<680> Let's see... who should my next target be?
NPC Mysterycat <0><1><2><98><26778> <18>but I should quit playing now. <30><214>I'll be back next year to pull another prank on people,<670> so I'll see you on the next <375>April Fools'<375>!

NPC Mysterycat <0><1><2><98><26791> I didn't think you'd be able to figure out which one was me!<15><30><18> Oh well.<680> No time to sulk now. <214>Who should I try to surprise next?
NPC Mysterycat <0><1><2><98><53>I thought it was gonna work...<680> <18>All right!<6> Gotta get a fresh start!<6> <214>My next disguise will be better yet!
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>Hooray!<680> You fell for it!
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>Heh heh heh!<680> I did it! I fooled you!
NPC Mysterycat I was disguised pretty well, right?
NPC Mysterycat How was that?<680> <25>You couldn't tell who the fake was, huh?
NPC Mysterycat I was disguised pretty well, right?<680> <18>You were on a roll until this final house, though! Close one!
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>I tricked you pretty good!<680> <87>I wonder who my next target should be...
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>Well, <670>it's <375>April Fools' Day<375>,<680> so it should be OK to pull a few pranks here and there,<1172> right? Anyway, I don't want to end my fun just yet, <18>but I should really wrap the games up for now. <214>But I'll be back next year, <616>so be prepared for my arrival!
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>I'm glad <2261>I could trick you at least once!<680> <36>I still have my pride as an expert of trickery, you know? <16>Whatever the case, I should stop playing and get going soon.<30><214>Be prepared, because next year I'll come back with another batch of expert tricks to fool everyone!
NPC Mysterycat You couldn't tell it was me, huh?
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>Yeah,<6> I'm starting to get into the swing of things!<680> <87>I gotta do my best disguise work for my next target!
NPC Mysterycat <0><22><2><260><4><22><2>Still,<6> <87>you have yet to see all the surprises I can muster!
NPC Mysterycat Are you still excited about it being <375>April Fools' Day<375>?<30><18>I was planning a special prank all day long...<30>But <36>it's already too late, so<8>.<8>.<8>.<680> <110>I'll be a good kitty for now.<680><16>
NPC Mysterycat <36>It's already gotten so late today<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><680> I guess I should take it easy with my jokes. I know you're excited and all, but <18>I'm already preoccupied with ideas for next year. I'm sorry I couldn't play with you, but I hope you still had lots of fun on <375>April Fools' Day<375>! <40>
