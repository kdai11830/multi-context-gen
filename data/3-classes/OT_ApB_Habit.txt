OT ApB Habit Do you have a minute, <70>?<619> I need some help with my catchphrase, <42>. <28>Oh, you see? Can't you tell? It feels weak, <70>. I need a new, powerful one, <42>. But what do YOU think? Does "<42>" still suit me?<775><776><786> Nah, change it! I think it's fine.
OT ApB Habit <13>I need some advice, <42>.<6> It's about a little problem I have with, <1172>well, <1172>my catchphrase. You know, that little touch I throw in once in a while, <42>? Yes, <1172>that right there, <1172><42>. It's sounding bland, so I'm thinking of changing it, <42>. What should I do?<775><776><786> Change it! Keep it.
OT ApB Habit <26>Really? You think I should keep it? <13>Well, if you say so, I'll hang on to it a little longer, <42>.

OT ApB Habit But I'd swear something's turned stale in my life. If it isn't my catchphrase... what IS it? <53>Hmmm. Back to the drawing board, I guess, <42>.
OT ApB Habit But I'm sure something about me is a bit bland lately.<30>I often see flaws in myself where there aren't any, <42>. <36>So I guess I'm still perfect.
OT ApB Habit Don't tell anyone I was thinking of changing my catchphrase, OK, <70>? <561>We don't need anyone gossiping about how I was questioning my own fresh factor, <42>.

OT ApB Habit <13>Now the only question is, <1172>how long until everyone starts copying MY catchphrase, <42>?
OT ApB Habit <18>Yes, it's already really growing on me, <42>. Thanks for the verbal makeover!
OT ApB Habit <219>Let's keep this between the two of us. You know how people gossip, <70>. I don't want everyone talking about how I was doubting my own fresh factor, <42>.
