HA FreeF MidWinter <616><375>Winter Solstice<375> makes me think about pumpkins.<15><7> Punch through one, and you won't catch a cold! <15><121>What?! You're saying pumpkins don't work that way?! They're only good for eating?! <110>Ha ha! Come on! Anybody can eat 'em. It takes a true tough guy to punch 'em! <8><41><42>!<6><214>
HA FreeF MidWinter <616>You can't have <375>Winter Solstice<375> without a hot, lemony bath!<30><87>If you can hold your breath under the hot, lemony water for over 10 seconds, you won't catch a cold!<30><15><121>What?! You're saying it should be enough to just soak in the hot, lemony water?<30><110>Ha ha! That's a boring way to build a cold-busting body! <8><41><42>!<6><214>
HA FreeF MidWinter <7>It's dark all day, so it might be a little dangerous out there today<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><25>I'll have to be extra careful when I go out on patrol around town!
HA FreeF MidWinter <53>When it's dark all day like this,<6> I get a little worried<6> that maybe the sun will never rise again.<6><30><31>If that ever happened, I'd never be able to get suntanned again!<15> That would be terrible,<8> <42>!
HA FreeF MidWinter <214>When the <375>Winter Solstice<375> comes, it makes me feel the real winter is finally here!<30><87>Everything else is just a warm-up. Or a cold-up, I guess. Either way, I better get to exercising!
