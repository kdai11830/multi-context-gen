FU ApB Request <219>Well,<6> I was wondering something.<619> <13>I know <107> is a quiet and safe place to live... Still,<8> wouldn't it be a good idea to have a <375>police station<375> just in case something were to go wrong? <214>As mayor,<1172> you could authorize the project.<6> Will you please consider it?<813>
FU ApB Request <13>Oh,<8> <3407>. Mayor,<8> I have a request!<6> Would you consider commissioning <77><814> here? <87>I think it'd be good for <107>, don't you,<8> <42>?<30><214>I'll tell <375>Isabelle <375>about my idea<1172> and hope that you'll consider it for the next public works project!<813>
FU ApB Request <13>Oh,<8> <3407>. Mayor,<1172> I have an idea for <107>'s next public works project!<6> <28><15>May I tell you about it? <214>In short,<8> I think everyone in town could benefit from having <77> <814>. <13>Please <616>think about it!<813>
FU ApB Request <214>I was reading a book about this famous <814> the other day. <87>I think <107> could really use one of those,<8> so I'd like to propose it as our next public works project. <16>I'll also let <375>Isabelle <375>know. Would you please consider it,<1172> <439>?<813>
FU ApB Request <13>Would you consider commissioning <77><814> as the next public works project? <87>In my opinion,<8> we'd see a big change in the way the town looks and feels. <6><13>I hope you'll consider it.<813>
FU ApB Request <13>I just thought of an idea that would make <107> an even better place to live!<6> I call it...<6><30><670><25>The <45><814> Construction Initiative!<619> <31>N-<8>not that it's an official initiative or anything! <219>I'm just hoping you'll consider <77><814> for the next public works project. <16>I'll register it with <375>Isabelle <375><13>while you think about it.<813>
