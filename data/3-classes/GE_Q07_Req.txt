GE Q07 Req <28>Huh? But didn't you find something, <70>?<30><31>How will I know if I lost something if you don't show it to me, <42>?<16>
GE Q07 Req <28>Hmm? Waityou had something to show me, didn't you, <70>?<30>If I lost something, I really want to see it, <42>!
GE Q07 Req <28>Wait. You thought I lost something, but now you've got nothing to show me, <70>? <38>Then you'll never know if it's really mine, <42>.
GE Q07 Req <561>Sorry, but that's not mine. Why don't you try someone else, <42>?
GE Q07 Req <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> No, that doesn't look like anything I own, <42>. Maybe ask someone else?
GE Q07 Req Sorry. That's not mine. But it must belong to someone, <42>.
GE Q07 Req <72>Hey! My book! I couldn't find it anywhere!<30><214>I guess I dropped it. It's one of my favorites.
GE Q07 Req <26>What?! I looked everywhere for this book!<30><36>I'm such a scatterbrain. I must have dropped it.
GE Q07 Req <26>Hey! I've been looking everywhere for my book!<30><214>I must have dropped it when I was walking around.
GE Q07 Req <26>Hey! My fancy pouch! <619><13>I must have dropped that when I was walking around town! It is SUCH a big relief to get that back, <42>.
GE Q07 Req <26>Wow! <6>I thought I'd lost my schmancy pouch forever!<619><214> Where'd you find it? I keep my favorite makeup inside, so I'm glad to get this back, <70>!
GE Q07 Req <26>What?! <6>Where'd you find this? I thought I'd never see my favorite pouch ever again! <44>This is where I put my most treasured possessions. So now I'll have a place to put them again!
GE Q07 Req <121>Where did you find this? Oh, never mind. I'm just glad to get it back!<30><38>Now I can keep both of my hands warm again.
GE Q07 Req <72>Hey, that's mine! I thought I'd never see it again!<30><214>I've felt so off balance without it! I'm so glad to have it back.
GE Q07 Req <121>Hold on! Where'd you get that?<6> That's the mitten I dropped when I was out playing! <38>I've felt only half as fashionable without it. I'm so happy to get this mitten back.
GE Q07 Req <26>What? Where'd you find this bag?<30>I've been down in the dumps since I lost it! I put <33> in there, <42>.
GE Q07 Req <167>Wow! That's my bag! How could I have lost something so valuable?<30><367>I'm so glad you found it, <70>.<6> I'd hate to think what would have happened if anyone else did.
GE Q07 Req <121>I was wondering what happened to this! <680><13>Thanks for finding it!<30>I don't know WHAT I would have done if I didn't get this back. I was so worried!
GE Q07 Req <214>Thanks for going to all the trouble of finding out who the owner was.<30><38>I don't have much to give you in thanks, but I hope you won't mind <77><834>...
GE Q07 Req <214>Thanks so much for bringing this to me, <70>. I need to give you something in thanks. How about this, <70>? It's <77><834>.
GE Q07 Req <214>Thanks for returning this to me.<6> Hey, I'd like to give you a little thank-you gift! <87>Yeah, I think you'll totally like this. It's <77><834>!
GE Q07 Req <38>I'd better be more careful in the future. I seem to drop things WAY too often, <42>!
GE Q07 Req <38>I'd better try harder not to lose my things when walking around!
GE Q07 Req <31>You know, I wish I didn't lose my stuff so often, <42>!
