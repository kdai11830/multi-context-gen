GE FreeA Friend <214>Have you noticed how <48> and <14> are always hanging out together? They're such good friends. <53>I wonder if they were, like, separated at birth or something! <38>How crazy!
GE FreeA Friend <214><48> and <14> are two peas in a pod. <141>They shop together, eat together, play together... <561>I'm not jealous or anything. I have, like, a bazillion friends. <40>But their relationship is something special!
GE FreeA Friend <40>Have you ever seen two friends as perfect for each other as <48> and <14>? <18>They're like PB and J.<8> Peas and carrots.<8> <367><41><117> and <33>!
GE FreeA Friend <28>Do you think <48> and <14> are good buddies? <214>They seem like they would be. <36>I mean, it's not like they're BFFs or anything...but they don't hate each other. <40>That's a good start!
GE FreeA Friend Call me crazy, but I just don't know what to think about <48> and <14>. <13>It's, like, sometimes they're total besties. <8><561>But other times I get the feeling they don't like each other. <219>Friendships can be complicated, I guess. <214>Maybe they just need time to get to know each other better.
GE FreeA Friend <214>Every time I see <48> and <14> hanging out together, I'm all like, <40>look at those two! <53>They seem to have the perfect friendship. Nothing too serious, but totally not shallow, either. <13>Sometimes I forget that friends are for fun, you know? <72>We could learn a lesson from those two!
GE FreeA Friend <561>I'm sick of hearing <48> and <14> fight like a couple of bratty kids! Honestly! They argue about the silliest things. <36>Like, whether you should put mayo or ketchup on your french fries. <25>Everyone knows the correct answer is pesto!
GE FreeA Friend <48> and <14> are driving me batty! They're always making me take sides. <28>"Who's wearing the cuter outfit, <963>?" they ask me. <669>As if!<30><319>Everyone knows I'm always wearing the cutest outfit in town!
GE FreeA Friend <214>Every time I see <48> and <14>, they're in a big fight. <103>So much drama! <53>Although it makes you wonder why they keep hanging out together.<30><110>Maybe they're taking the whole "keep your friends close but your enemies closer" thing too seriously!
GE FreeA Friend <13>You know who's a good listener? <48>. <40>I can yammer to her for hours on end. What a great friend!
GE FreeA Friend <53>Someone asked me if <48> was my total BFF, <8><214>but I think we're more like FFFAW. <40>You know, Fine Friends for a While. We like to have tea parties <105>and go dancing!
GE FreeA Friend I absolutely adore <48>,<8> <128>but she drives me batty! She always has to be the winner, no matter what. <25>But being the winner is MY job!<619> How can I be friends with my rival? It's sooooo complicated!
GE FreeA Friend <214>You know who's kinda awesome? <48>. <40>We can talk for hours, and I totally forget what I'm doing! <44>We had <77><639> party, and before I knew it, <319>I drank 32 cups of the stuff! Like, yum!
GE FreeA Friend <214>I feel like I can really be myself around <48>. <40>Plus, she's a really good listener! <18>That's important to me in a friend, 'cause I like to talk about myself a lot, <42>.<8> <110>Hahahaha!
GE FreeA Friend <28>Have you noticed that <48> has been kinda snippy lately? <561>I'm all, like, check yourself at the door! <7>Maybe she just got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning<8><8><128>and every morning this week!
GE FreeA Friend <141>Friendships are like flowers! You need to feed them and water them before they really blossom. My friendship with <48> is kinda like that. <561>We're not super close right now... <31>but if I work a little harder, maybe we could be better friends!
GE FreeA Friend <40><48> is totally coolfor a boy, that is! <38>I mean, he's actually fun to hang out with. <214>We like to take long walks together. <87>And he's always willing to hold my purse for me when we go shopping!
GE FreeA Friend <40>Have you noticed that <48> is, like, super stylish? <87>I'm always asking him for fashion tips! <38>We've bonded over our mutual adoration of fancy clothes, <219>but I hope our friendship grows deeper. <561>Not that fashion is shallow or anything! <13>But I like to talk about serious stuff too, you know?
GE FreeA Friend <354>Things are totally weird between me and <48>. We had a huge fight the other day! <18>I said <33> was yummier than <355><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> <561>and he said I was wrong! <36>I mean, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, right? <13>I hope we're able to forgive and forget...
GE FreeA Friend <53>You know, I never really gave <48> a second thought...<30><40>But we've been getting to know each other recently, and he's actually pretty cool! <141>We have more in common than I ever realized. Here's hoping our friendship will grow!
GE FreeA Friend <25>Everyone in town knows I'm stylish. I guess that's why <48> has been asking me for fashion advice! <214>I told him I'd take him on a shopping spree. <103>Doesn't that just sound like the most fun ever? We'll see how it goes, but I think <48><87> is definitely someone I can become better friends with!
GE FreeA Friend <48> has been acting so distant! <7>It's driving me batty.<30><13>We used to bond over our mutual love of <33>. <354>But lately, he won't touch the stuff. <28>What's up with that? I hope he still wants to be friends with me...
GE FreeA Friend <13>I totally misjudged <48>. <18>He's a pretty cool guy!<30><219>I didn't think we had anything in common, but it turns out we like a lot of the same stuff! <367>Like <117>! How could I not be friends with someone who likes something so yummers?
