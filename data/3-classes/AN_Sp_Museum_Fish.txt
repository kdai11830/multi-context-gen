AN Sp Museum_Fish <13>Everything in this aquarium is just so cool looking! <87>All the fish and sea creatures make me wanna dance! There might not be a lot of 'em yet, but they sure do make a big impact! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <13>When there are so few fishies and stuff, I find myself getting really attached to each critter! <87>I think I'm gonna name 'em and come see 'em every day! Yeah! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <617>Yaaawwwn<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><619><18> Wow. Watching these fish move around really makes me sleepy. <6><41><42>.
AN Sp Museum_Fish <53>The other day, <789> was going on and on about the water quality here<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <28>Is it really that great? <15><16>Everything in here does seem really healthy, so I guess it's all good, <6><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <18>This museum is practically a main attraction in <470> now!<30><25>I mean, we've got every single type of fish and sea creature there is! How cool is that? <13>Every time I go to another town, I just gotta brag! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <13>So we're still kinda in the early planning stages with our aquarium.<30><18>Right now, all you can do is look at the water and just kind of imagine a buncha fish! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <26>Huh?<6> Is it lame that there's not a lot to see here right now? Maybe.<30><31>But, hey! The star of <107> is working night and day to fill this place to the brim, <6><42>!<15>
AN Sp Museum_Fish <18>How 'bout it? How's the display these days?<15><13> We've got some pretty rare stuff here now, right? <87>Word on the street is that this place is one of the best-kept secrets in all of <107>! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <13>Heh! What do you think?<6><16> This place has really come a long way, huh?<30><87>Take your time and look around! Take it all in! <6><41><42>!
AN Sp Museum_Fish <18>This place is really more of a fancy <107>-fish theme park than a simple little aquarium. <25>Check it out! We have every type of fish and sea creature here!<15><13> Rare ones too! Enjoy, <6><42>!
