NPC Tunekichi <110>Aha! Cousin!<680><214> I just know this work of art will find its true home now that you've decided to buy. I'll be sending your purchase off to ya as soon as the exhibition is over, so keep watch for it!
NPC Tunekichi <214><286>Thanks, cuz!<286>
NPC Tunekichi <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>Thanks, <1172><325>cuz!<286>
NPC Tunekichi <110>Ah! <670>Welcome, welcome! <141>Thank ya for visitin' my shop!<6><214><30><1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <23><670>Oh!<670> <28>Could this be your first time here meetin' ol' <375>Redd<375>?<30><110>Well, ain't that lovely!<670> <214>I'm always happy to meet fellow art lovers!<30><16>This is <375>Redd's Gallery<375>, where we specialize exclusively in the finest art<214> you'll ever see in this world!
NPC Tunekichi <87>This is your one and only chance to buy a piece of famous art<44> for a bargain that can only be CRAAAZY! <16>But of course, since these are all <16>really rare items, <616>we sell only one item per customer! Why, ya ask? Because a bargain THIS crazy wouldn't be fair without some limits. I'd be penniless! <214>So come on in!<670> Don't be shy! Look around all ya want! <325>Hee hee hee!<286>
NPC Tunekichi <110>Well now,<670> welcome, welcome!<680> <141>Please come on in!<15><30><214>Ahh!<670> I'm so glad to see a cousin come back for a second glance!
NPC Tunekichi <44>I'll tell ya, this week's items are as rare as they come. <110>I'm almost green with envy that I can't buy 'em all! <16>But remember, we sell only one item per customer,<1172> so make your choice very carefully!<670>
NPC Tunekichi <16>I've already had some interest today in the wares, <44>so if there's anythin' ya like, now's the time to strike!
NPC Tunekichi <16>We've had a busy morning, so we're down to our last item! <44> You'd be smart to buy it up right away!
NPC Tunekichi <26><670>Well now,<670> if it isn't <439>!<619> <44>How've ya been, cousin? Still well since we last spoke? <16>Oh!<670> I see! You've got to wait a little longer for your item!<30>With bargains this low, <294>I've gotta ensure the orders are all correct.<30>Ya can't purchase anything else until your order comes in, but <214>you're welcome to look around!
NPC Tunekichi <110>Oh ho,<670> welcome to my gallery!<680> <141>Come in and see some art!<30><214>Oh boy!<670> Cousin! <28>When was the last time you were here?<619> <214>Well, I'm rather pleased to see ya back again!
NPC Tunekichi <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670><23><670>Oh yes, before I forget!<619> <16>The item you bought last time will be getting delivered fairly soon. I can't let you buy anything else until it comes in, but<214> you're more than welcome to look around!
NPC Tunekichi <110>Hi!<670> Welcome! Come on in! <670><141>How can I help you?<30><214>Ahh!<670> You're from <470>, aren't ya?<30>Comin' all this way to see my magnificent gallery? <616>It seems we have a bargain hunter here!
NPC Tunekichi Sorryonly one item per customer per visit. Otherwise ol' <375>Redd<375>'ll go broke. <214>But feel free to browse!
NPC Tunekichi <38>Hold up there, cuz!<6> We're actually right at closin' time.<670><1214><1215><30>Sorry to say it, but you'll have to come see me some other time!<1214><1215>
NPC Tunekichi <214>Trust me, cuz!<670> You made a really smart purchase just now!<30><16>If ya only knew the faces people wear when they see these sold-out signs! Truly heartbreaking! <26>And also a pity!<16> If it were up to me, I'd help them out and sell the same item all over again. <44>Just thinkin' about bringin' that sort of joy to people's lives is makin' me tear up<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Tunekichi <53>Ya might not realize it<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6><1172>but one simple conversation and I can tell that <18>you, cuz, love the arts!<214> <110>It makes trips out here to <107> all worth the effort!<214>
NPC Tunekichi <13>You've gotta wait a bit longer until your previous item is delivered. I can't sell ya more until it arrives! <16>And to make matters worse, if your mailbox is full, that item won't fit! Be careful about that, cousin!
NPC Tunekichi You, cuz, are in luck! You have the pick of the litter for any single item ol' <375>Redd<375> has in his gallery today! Don't miss out on an opportunity like this! It's good luck is what it is! Remember<44>first come, best served!
NPC Tunekichi Would ya believe we were full this morning? My bargains are so crazy, we're sellin' stuff FAST!<1172> <44>You've got no time to lose! I'd tell ya to choose somethin' quickly, but I trust your judgment<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Tunekichi <214>Cousin, ya came just in time!<670> I'm down to one last item here! Can you believe this generosity? <294>Wouldn't ya rather regret it after buying it instead of regret not buying it?<121><1214><3721> <31>Er,<1172> I mean, there's nothin' here that you'd regret buying! Trust me! Ol' <375>Redd<375>'s on the level!
NPC Tunekichi <53>Ya can't really judge our products on their brand names but rather whether they're great pieces of art. <16>Instead of tryin' to decide if it's real or not,<1172> <18>it's more important to decide if ya really like it or not.
NPC Tunekichi <53>Very rarely,<1172> I get customers askin' me the question<1172> "Is this real?"<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><36>Boy, I'll tell ya, I can't shake my head strongly enough at notions like that. <16>After all, when it comes to artwork, ya gotta choose it based on how ya FEEL, not how it LOOKS.
NPC Tunekichi <28>So what do ya think?<670> The prices are impressive, yeah? Don't ya feel like it's time to get a little cultured? <44>It does a body good to live in an environment full of art, ya know?
NPC Tunekichi <28>So, cousin, what do ya think?<670> Wouldn't ya like to order your very own piece of class?<8> <18>Yup, a bit of swank in your house <18>may do wonders for your longevity and social life.
NPC Tunekichi If you're interested in a piece, ol' <375>Redd<375> will mail it to ya after the exhibit is over for the day. But if your mailbox is full, ya might be waiting longer, so ya gotta be real careful about that sorta thing.
NPC Tunekichi <53>Findin' just the right bargain is somethin' really special. <561>It's not for the faint of heart<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16>Some of my customers are so dedicated that they come from far away to check out my stuff. <214>Without the loyalists, true friends through and through, where would ol' <375>Redd<375> be? Penniless and broken!
NPC Tunekichi <214>Cousin, you're all right, ya know that? Just look how far you've come to keep ol' <375>Redd<375> in aprons. Never you worry, because I'm sure I'll return the favor someday. Maybe even with a visit to your hometown!<44><670>
NPC Tunekichi What d'ya think?<670> <110>Ya couldn't find better art if ya tried to make it yourself, am I right?<214> Next time I'm in your neck of the woods,<670> I'll bring only the best,<1172> <44>so you'd better get your Bells ready!
NPC Tunekichi I started out like any gentleman with a humble, fair-priced furniture shop, but now I'm on to art! <110>It's all thanks to customer support from friends and loyalists like you and your kin! <375>Redd<375> thanks ya! <214>
NPC Tunekichi The art on display is as rare and valuable as it comes, so keep your paws off the merchandise. <214>Instead, ya can press left or right on to see the back of it, or you can zoom in for a closer look!
NPC Tunekichi <649>Well, cuz, you've got good taste<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> Such a great piece of fine art here<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><16>Displayin' this in your home <294>is sure to make ya both the happiest and classiest individual in town! <214>I'd send it home with ya right away, but it's only fair to have ya wait until the exhibition tent closes.
NPC Tunekichi <13>That <834> was bought by <802>. That's one of my cousins from here in town. <16>It's amazing being able to spot a piece with that much pomp and circumstance. <18>It must be a gift<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Tunekichi <13>That <834> was bought by <802> from out in <1540> a few towns over. <16>You see what sort of devotion folks have for ol' <375>Redd<375>'s business? <18>That's the quality speakin' there<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Tunekichi <26>Oh!<670> You like that one there, do ya?<670><619> <44>Well,<1172> I guess anybody would like that <834>, huh? But sorry, friend. Items are limited to one per customer per visit, <38>so you're just outta luck for the day.
NPC Tunekichi <26>I see!<670> Ya seem to be really close to that <834><30015> <18>only the biggest suckers walk away from a one-in-a-lifetime bargain like this! <16>I dare ya to say no to somethin' this nice at a price as crazy as <375><863><24468> Bells<375>! Straight up dare!<1172><214> <28491><849><796><1099> I'll take it! OK, no.
NPC Tunekichi <167>Whoa!<670> I see you've got eyes only for that <834> there! I'd say it has eyes for you too!<30><36>I must say, <30020> I'm sellin' it for just <375><863><24468> Bells <375>this time and this time only<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <294>What d'ya think? <30024><849><796><1099> I'll take it! I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi <26>Oh ho!<670> <28>Am I mistaken? <110>Because I see ya lookin' pretty close at that <834> right there!<1172> <16><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>Well,<670> <18>I would be too, if I were you.<619> <36>Art fanatics like us, we can spot a true gem a mile away. Maybe two! <44>You're in luck, cuz. Nobody's got to this one yet, so I'm still able to give ya a bargain at <375><863><24468> Bells<375>! <31>Boy,<8> what would I do if I sold it for a loss?<670> That's CRAZY. How can that be good business sense?<8><38><849><796><1099> I'll take it! Changed my mind.
NPC Tunekichi <318>Uh-oh<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6> You're interested in that <834><30026> it's impossible to mask the raw intrigue that surrounds such a piece,<36> <30030> you're the first to get to it, makin' ya rather fortunate!<30><44>Just 'cause I like ya, I'll sell it for a low, low price of <375><863><24468> Bells<375>!<1172><849><796><1099> I'll take it! No, I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi <31>Well, look at that!<670> You've noticed that <834><30033> <44>You're the kinda buyer who saves the best for last, aren't ya? <16>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><36>Well, that's my fault, since I have no choice but to give in now that you found this amazin' piece. <16>Truth be told, paw to heart, <3142>I'm sellin' it for the unbeatable price of <375><863><24468> Bells<375> today only! I can assure ya, <561>you'll never have another chance like this one<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> <44>What d'ya think? <30041><849><796><1099> It's mine! I don't want it.
NPC Tunekichi <167><670>Ya pullin' my leg?! <670>What a shame<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.!<619> There's no guarantee you'll get another chance like this, <561>no, sir!<670>
NPC Tunekichi <214>Aha! I knew that's what you'd say!<30><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>Wait. <167><670> What?!<6> Ya don't have enough money for it!<7> Ya tryin' to pull a fast one on ol' <375>Redd<375>?! Come on!<670> Stop with the bad jokes!
NPC Tunekichi <26>Whoa! Really?!<670> What a shock!<2289> <214>Well, obviously you'd have to be as CRAZY as me to pass it up! Lemme just get that sweet, sweet payment, and we'll be all set!
NPC Tunekichi <214><670>OK!<670> Got it!<619> Well then,<1172> I'll mark this <834> as a sold item! Everyone else is outta luck!
NPC Tunekichi Don't ya worryI'll wrap this up nice and safe and mail it to ya as soon as this exhibit is over! But remember, if your mailbox is full, it won't get delivered. So make sure you've got the space ready!
NPC Tunekichi <13>The <834> was bought by <802>, hailin' clear from <1540>! <16><1000><1180>S<1001>#x0; came all the way to THIS town to buy it! <18>Now THAT is the sign of a true fine-art connoisseur<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
