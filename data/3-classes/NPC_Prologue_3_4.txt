NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>Ah, hello!<6> Welcome! Welcome!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <72>You must be the new mayor,<8> am I right?<16><619> <375>Isabelle<375> at the town hall told me to expect you! <214>On behalf of the <107> chamber of commerce,<670> I'm pleased to welcome you!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <72>Ah,<8> you must be <16>the newest resident of our little town.<8> It's <439>, yes? I heard about you from <375>Isabelle<375> at the town hall a short while ago!
NPC Prologue 3_4 So, <439><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6> You're here today because you want to build a house, <28>yes? <141>Very good! Very good!<670> I can build one just about anywhere you want, yes, I can indeed!<13>
NPC Prologue 3_4 Ah,<670> and you want to move here,<28> hm?<619> Do you have a home and belongings from your previous town? <16>If so, <670>once you pick where you want to live,<6><214> I can take care of the rest!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>So<670> have you decided on where you want to live?<796><797> Yep! Not yet.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <110>Then this won't take long at all!<680><16><619> Just take me where you want to build your new home, <439>!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <110>Color me unsurprised!<680> <16>You DID just move here, after all, and there's no sense rushing into anything! I understand completely!<15> Take your time to walk around town and find that perfect place. I will follow you,<8> so if anything strikes your fancy, please tell me!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>Well,<8> I must head back to my shop, <8>so here is where our ways part.<30><41><439>, you need to head back to the <375>town hall<375> now<28>, do you not?<30><16>Now that your residence is secured,<670> you must get this information registered at once! Yes, yes! <214>I'll work out the numbers in the meantime, so come by my shop tomorrow or the day after. <616>Thanks for your business!<6> I rather appreciate it! Hm, yes, yes!
NPC Prologue 3_4 Hey!<8> Hey!<8> Focus!<8> This isn't the time for dawdling.<8> You need to find a place to live, yes?
NPC Prologue 3_4 That's the way to the beach!<6> You can't build a house on sand!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <31>Please wait!<680><16>
NPC Prologue 3_4 <26>Hey!<6> Wait one moment! <16>You can't live in the shopping district.<670> Find a spot of land on this side, yes?
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>Thanks for waiting!<680> We've relocated it! Inside and out, it's just as it was before your stressful move. <16><1172><26> That reminds me! I'll make sure that <16>the <375>Happy Home Academy<375> has been updated with your new address. <214>Yes,<8> I must head back to my shop,<8> so I'll say my good-byes for now.<30><16><41><439>, you'll be heading back to the town hall<28> after this, hm?<30><16>Now that you have a place to live,<670> you must take care of your resident registration, oh, yes, yes! <214>Well then, thank you for using <141><375>Nook's Homes<375> for all your housing needs!<6> <214>I do so appreciate it!
NPC Prologue 3_4 Yes, yes!<670> So you would like to <28>build your house here?<796><797> Yep! Here! No.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>That's perfectly fine!<6> Please take your time.<8> There's no rush at all.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hm, yes, to give you an idea of how much space you need for building your new house<8>.<8>.<8>. <16>From where you're standing now, you'd need to be able to take about <375>four<375> steps left, right, and back. <110>Without that much space, even if you planned to expand in the future, you wouldn't be able to do so.<6><214> <16> We can move plants and trees when doing the construction, but we can't move rocks or buildings, no, no. <214>When you're looking for a place to build,<1172> please keep that in mind, hm?
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>No, no. This is too close to a public works project.<30>I'm sorry, so very sorry, but you don't have enough space to build a home here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>No, no. This is too close to another planned building.<30>I'm sorry, so very sorry, but you don't have enough space to build a home here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> We'd have to tear down a public works project, but if that's OK, I think we can build here, yes.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> We'd have to tear down some public works projects, but if that's OK, I think we can build here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <18>Yes, yes.<670> There's plenty of space to build a house here!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the town hall, so it's just the spot for you, mayor.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the town hall, so it's very convenient!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the train station and shopping area,<8> so it's really convenient if you like to shop!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the beach.<8> It's a dream location if you like the ocean.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the recycle shop,<8> so it's convenient if you like changing up your home's look.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the caf,<8> so it's perfect if you like coffee!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And it's close to the police station,<8> so you don't have to worry about safety.<6> <16>I think<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And there are plenty of neighbors nearby,<8> so it's the perfect place for socializing!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And there's a river nearby.<8> If you like fishing or being in nature, it's the perfect spot!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And there's a space nearby for festivals and events!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>Oh, yes, yes! This spot is really close to the train tracks, so I'd highly suggest it to railroading fans!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>And there aren't many buildings around,<8> so it's perfect for those who like peace and quiet!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This spot is too close to the river to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This spot is too close to the pond to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This spot is too close to the cliff to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Umm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This space is too close to your neighbors,<670> so there isn't enough room for a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>Looks like <4315> <814> is in the way, so we can't build here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This spot is too close to the train tracks to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Umm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This area has a large rock in the way, so there is no room to build your home, no, no!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>This spot is too close to the plaza to build a house.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>Umm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <16>There is another building nearby, so there isn't enough room for your house here.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>A different space would be a better choice.<30>There isn't enough room here to accommodate potential future remodels.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>Hold on a moment.<670> Let's see<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <649>It will look something like this<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <53>We'll need to move trees, flowers, and any buried items in order to start building. <214>But if you're OK with that, we can start right away!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <28>So?<6> Does this location suit your needs? Hm?<796><797> Yep! Hang on a sec...
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>That's quite fine.<6> Take your time.
NPC Prologue 3_4 <103>OK!<670> It's decided then!<680><13><30><16>It will take a bit of time to build your house, so for today, let's reserve the space for you<8>.<8>.<8>.<670> There we go! Yes, yes! Wonderful!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <110>Ta-da!<680> And with that, this space is officially yours, <439>!<13><30><16>Umm,<670><53> including the cost of the land, materials, building costs,<670> et cetera<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><31>Well, the calculation is complicated, so I can't come up with it just now.<670> I'll tell you the total later.<16> Anyway,<8> I'm sure you're very busy, since you just moved here<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><214>Once you've taken care of other things, stop by my store again to get the bill, hm? <16>.<8>.<8>.<8>Ah, but I suppose you still need a place to rest your head, right?<619> <72>Give me just a moment<8>.<8>.<8>.<16>
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>That does it then!<30>Yes, I'll have the moving company get right on moving your things, so wait just a moment<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>Thanks for waiting!<680> We've relocated it! Inside and out, it's just as it was before the move! <16>Well,<8> I must head back to my shop,<8> so I'll say my good-byes for now.<30><41><439>, you'll be heading back to the town hall<28> after this, yes?<30><16>Now that you've got a place to live,<670> you have to take care of your resident registration with <375>Isabelle<375>! <214>Well then, thank you for using <141><375>Nook's Homes<375> for all your housing needs!<6> <214>I appreciate it, yes indeed!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <4074><105><670>Ta-ta-ta-DA!<15><4149> <13>I'll let you borrow this tent so you have somewhere to sleep! <214>I've also put up a mailbox, so you can even start receiving mail!<680> <325>It's a little shabby looking, though... <286><16>I bet you rarely see a tent with a mailbox, right?<6> <110>Oh ho ho ho ho!<15><13>
NPC Prologue 3_4 <16>Well,<8> I'll be returning to my shop, so let's part ways here.<30><41><439>, you need to head back<8> to the town hall<28>, hm?<30><16>Now that you know where you'll be living,<670> you have to get registered as a resident, so talk to <375>Isabelle<375>. <214>In the meantime, I'll work out the numbers. Come by my shop again later. <616>Thanks for your business!<6> I do appreciate it, yes, yes!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>I'm so glad you found a nice spot!
NPC Prologue 3_4 <28>What's wrong?<680> Don't you need to go back to the town hall right away?
NPC Prologue 3_4 <214>If you ever want to talk about remodeling your home,<670> just come see me in my shop, hm?
NPC Prologue 3_4 Once you wrap things up at the town hall,<8> come see me in my shop.<30><214>I'll be able to tell you how much your down payment will be when I next see you, yes I will!
