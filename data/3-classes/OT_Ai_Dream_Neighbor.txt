OT Ai Dream_Neighbor I'm glad YOU'RE here, <70>. I can't shake the feeling that something weird is going on. <13>At least I can count on you to always be you. So <1172>thanks, <42>.
OT Ai Dream_Neighbor <13>Oh, <1172>I'm glad to see you, <70>!<6> <28>Are we in <470> or not? It's the same, <1172>yet different...
OT Ai Dream_Neighbor <214>Good morning! Or <1172>good night?<6> Hmm. It's so hard to tell time inside a dream, <70>.
OT Ai Dream_Neighbor <214>It must be fate, <1172>the two of us meeting here like this! What else could explain it, <70>?
OT Ai Dream_Neighbor <28>This place is just a little bit strange, don't you think, <70>? Where exactly are we...<1172><42>?
