ZK Sp Museum_Fish <41><70><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>at this rate,<2289> I feel like this aquarium will never be an attractive relaxation spot. <53><2289>This is supposed to be a room to display fish,<2289> but there's hardly any fish in here on display<8>.<8>.<8>.
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <7>I bet you there are still quite a few fish swimming around out there we've yet to see,<8> <70>.
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <367><2289><41><70>,<8> don't you think it's so romantic?<20879> You know, seeing the fish swim gracefully past the glass<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <649><2289>I wish I could be surrounded by all the fish as I swam along with them!<20879> Feeling nature's harmony<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <13>Yes!
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <219>I find myself pretty lucky to be a resident of <107>,<8> <70>!<30><13>I mean,<8> I can see every kind of fish or aquatic creature just by coming here any day of the week<8>.<8>.<8>.

ZK Sp Museum_Fish <38>Compared to when we first opened,<2289> this place has become a little more like an aquarium, you know?
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <72>Oh, hey! Look,<8> <70>!<20879> <13>That fish over there<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>kinda looks like me, <25>don't you think?
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <72>Oh, hey! Look,<8> <70>!<20879> <13>That fish is looking this way!<20879> <44>Maybe it's looking at me?
ZK Sp Museum_Fish <28>How do you like it,<8> <70>?<30><214>You can find every kind of fish and aquatic creature in this aquarium!<30><212><2289>Knowing all these sea creatures are staring at me is making my cheeks blush<8>.<8>.<8>.
