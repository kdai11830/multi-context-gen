NPC Obj Chest ...Pretend like nothing was seen...
NPC Obj Chest What is seen cannot be unseen...
NPC Obj Chest Mm-hmm... So THIS is what's in here...
NPC Obj Chest ...This is loaded with old memories!
NPC Obj Chest Let's check what's inside...
NPC Obj Chest ...Huh? Why does he have something like this in here...?
NPC Obj Chest Uh...is it possible... that he sleeps in here sometimes...?
NPC Obj Chest It looks like there are a lot of duplicate items in here...
NPC Obj Chest This must be his treasure box!
NPC Obj Chest It's full of snacks...
NPC Obj Chest Ugh, so dirty...
NPC Obj Chest ...He needs to clean up a bit!
NPC Obj Chest Why would he keep something like this in here...?
NPC Obj Chest It looks like the ultimate level of the cramming technique!
NPC Obj Chest The smell of sweaty socks slowly spreads throughout the room...
NPC Obj Chest Ahh, such a manly way to store things!
NPC Obj Chest Ummm... Why are there old sandwiches in here...?
NPC Obj Chest This gives a glimpse of his true mentality...
NPC Obj Chest After looking in there, his personality really makes sense.
NPC Obj Chest ...Well, that was totally unexpected.
NPC Obj Chest Wow, it's as if he wanted people to look in here...
NPC Obj Chest This is a pretty exciting way to store a ton of stuff...
NPC Obj Chest Whoa... That's an odd way to store things...
NPC Obj Chest Why does everything in here smell like cologne...?
NPC Obj Chest This is so much like him it's scary...
NPC Obj Chest The gentle fragrance from this is actually quite refreshing!
NPC Obj Chest Looks very clean and organized!
NPC Obj Chest Whoa... It's like storing magic!
NPC Obj Chest This is a really interesting storage method for someone to choose...
NPC Obj Chest Everything in here seems to be in really good condition!
NPC Obj Chest ...She's actually very organized!
NPC Obj Chest Wow! It's interesting to see how she has her stuff organized!
NPC Obj Chest Wow, it's full of all sorts of little trinkets and baubles...
NPC Obj Chest Perhaps she's the type of person who can't throw things away?
NPC Obj Chest This can hold a lot more than anyone would suspect...
NPC Obj Chest Ooh, it smells nice in here!
NPC Obj Chest The contents in here seem to be arranged in a very precarious way...
NPC Obj Chest She seems to be ready for just about anything at any time, huh?
NPC Obj Chest Every little thing in here looks really gorgeous!
NPC Obj Chest Hmmm... The way things are stored here doesn't disappoint!
NPC Obj Chest ...Huh?! What's this nice smell?
NPC Obj Chest This shows that she's obsessed with her particular hobbies...
NPC Obj Chest ...Sometimes it's best to forget what has just been seen.
NPC Obj Chest Tossing what she doesn't need seems to be her motto...
NPC Obj Chest ...Huh. She seems to enjoy keeping things nice and neat.
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Oh,<6> looks like <77> <834> is in here!
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670><41><77><834> all the way in the back? And it doesn't seem like it's being used?
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670><41><77><834> is just sitting here covered in dust!
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Oh,<6> <77><834> is pushed all the way to the back!
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Oh,<6> is this <77> <834>?
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Ah, <77><834> is in the back, and it doesn't seem like it's being used a whole lot.
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Oh, <6>a dusty, old <834>?
NPC Obj Chest <8>.<8>.<8>.<670>Oh,<6> it looks like there's <77><834> all the way in the back!
NPC Obj Chest It's empty because it's just a display piece!
