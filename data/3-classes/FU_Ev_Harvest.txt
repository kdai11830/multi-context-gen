FU Ev Harvest <214>Hooray for the <375>Harvest Festival<375>!<6> Everyone in town is busy cooking.<30><18>I thought I'd try out some new recipes this year,<8> <42>.
FU Ev Harvest <141>Today is our <375>Harvest Festival<375>!<6> I've been waiting all month for this.<6> It's one of my favorite holidays! <214>I'm going to try making something new this year.<6> Something exciting!
FU Ev Harvest <28>Is everyone else caught up in the festivities?<30><214>Once I finish up here, I'll join them.<6> But for now I'm still busy cooking<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
FU Ev Harvest <31>Eep,<8> I need to get started on my next dish!<619> Sorry.<8> There are just so many things I want to make<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
FU Ev Harvest <53>Actually,<8> you wouldn't happen to have <77><834>,<8> would you? <13>If you did,<8> I'd be willing to trade you for another ingredient.<6> We could both benefit.
FU Ev Harvest <53>I can't complete this dish without <77><834>.<619><16> You don't happen to have one,<8> do you?<796><797> Yes, please take it! I don't have one.
FU Ev Harvest Say,<8> if you could give me <77> <834>,<8> that would really help me out!<796><797> Here you go! I don't have one.
FU Ev Harvest <13>OK.<6> Please keep me in mind if you come across any later.<6> I'd trade you another ingredient for it!
FU Ev Harvest <18>Yes,<6> I suppose it's not that easy to come by,<8> <42>.
FU Ev Harvest <28>Pardon?<6> Were you trying to give me something?<6><16><38> Oh,<8> my mistake.
FU Ev Harvest <38>That's awfully nice,<8> but I really need <77><834>.<619><13> If you get one,<8> I'd love to trade.
FU Ev Harvest <72>You'll trade with me?<619><214> Thank you very much!<6> Here.<8> I can give you my <834> in return.
FU Ev Harvest <141>Wonderful.<8> Now I can finish up this dish and start another!<6> Thank you!
FU Ev Harvest <219>Oh,<8> and I'm not sure if you're interested, but<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><40>I stumbled upon a way to make a certain dish taste amazing.<6> Would you like to hear about it?
FU Ev Harvest <18>So when you're making <1335>,<8> just add a little <375>lemon <375>juice.<6> It tastes great!
FU Ev Harvest <18>Ready?<6> When you're making <1335>,<8> mix in half a cup of diced <375>apple<375>. <13>That crunchy texture really livens up the dish.
FU Ev Harvest <13>So<8> I figured this out while I was making <1335>.<6> Just stir in honey from a <375>beehive<375>. <214>The flavor is divine!
FU Ev Harvest <13>Well,<8> I was in the middle of making this <1335> when I accidentally added some <375>vinegar<375>. <214>Wouldn't you know,<8> it turned out delicious!
FU Ev Harvest <13>Well,<8> I discovered when I made <1335> that you can include a tablespoon of <375>butter<375>. It adds a depth and richness that I really like.
FU Ev Harvest <18>If I make <1335>,<8> I always add a little <375>coconut<375> milk.<15> It helps to balance sweet and spicy.
FU Ev Harvest <13>I'll probably head over to the event plaza when I finish cooking,<8> <42>.
FU Ev Harvest <214>I tried so many new recipes today!<6> My long-term goal is to mix and match ingredients like a real chef!
FU Ev Harvest <13>There are still lots of recipes I want to try.<6><18> I've seen some fascinating shows on the local cooking channel.

FU Ev Harvest <13>Did you enjoy this year's <375>Harvest Festival<375>,<8> <70>?<6> I hope so!
FU Ev Harvest <367>I love the <375>Harvest Festival<375>.<6> I only tasted a little of <375>Franklin<375>'s cooking, but the flavors were amazing.
FU Ev Harvest <13>I'm already looking forward to next year's <375>Harvest Festival<375>.<6> I can't wait to watch <375>Franklin<375> in action again!
FU Ev Harvest <367>I love the <375>Harvest Festival<375>.<6> I only tasted a little of <375>Franklin<375>'s cooking, but the flavors were amazing.
FU Ev Harvest <13>It looks like<375> Franklin <375>was trying for a healthier menu this year.<6><214> I'm glad,<8> because I still ate a lot of soup!
FU Ev Harvest <38>I think I ate too much today.<6> Far too much.<619> <219>But if there was dessert<8>.<8>.<8>. I'm sure I could find room for it.
FU Ev Harvest <141>Today was so much fun,<8> and that main course<8>.<8>.<8>.wow!<619><214> I wish I knew how <375>Franklin <375>mixed his ingredients!
FU Ev Harvest <141>I can't remember a better <375>Harvest Festival<375>!<6> All the food was delicious,<8> and dessert was<8>.<8>.<8>.delectable! <18>Whatever <375>Franklin <375>did to his usual recipes really worked!
FU Ev Harvest <72>I heard you helped <375>Franklin <375>find some of his ingredients this year!<30><16>Not only that,<8> but you supplied some<367> special ingredients that made everything taste amazing. <214>I'm really impressed,<8> <42>!
FU Ev Harvest <214>This year's <375>Harvest Festival <375>was quite the success!<6><367> <375>Franklin<375>'s four-course meal was delicious.
FU Ev Harvest Whew<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I'm stuffed!<619><214> You deserve a big pat on the back for helping <375>Franklin<375> cook,<8> <70>!
FU Ev Harvest <13>So<2261> I like to eat <375>oysters <375>with a little <375>lemon <375>juice on them.<6> Just a spritz is enough. Of course it's just my opinion,<8> but I think any dish that uses oysters tastes better with lemon.
FU Ev Harvest <13>So<2261> when I make a salad with a lot of <375>mushrooms<375>,<8> I feel like it needs something to give it texture. I used half a cup of diced <375>apples <375>the other day on a whim,<8> and it was perfect!
FU Ev Harvest <28>OK,<2261> have you ever made <375>fruit salad<375>?<6> In most salads you'd use vinegar.<30>But in <375>fruit salad<375>, I think you should use honey.<6> Preferably straight from a <375>beehive<375>!<6> It's just delicious.
FU Ev Harvest <13>So<2261> adding dressing to a salad with very different ingredients can be tricky.<30>When it comes to <375>mixed salads<375>,<8> I've found my best friend is a bottle of <375>vinegar<375>.<6> It's simple but effective!
FU Ev Harvest <28>OK,<2261> do you worry that salads with a lot of <375>fish<375> smell too,<8> well,<8> fishy?<30><13>If you didn't already know,<1172> adding some <375>lemon <375>juice really helps with that.<6> I highly recommend it!
FU Ev Harvest <13>So<2261> you know it's the season for collecting mushrooms, right?<6> I've been using them a lot lately. I especially like to make <375>mushroom bisque <375>at night.<6> My own little trick is melting a pat of <375>butter<375> on top!
FU Ev Harvest <13>Well,<1172> when I collect lots of <375>shellfish<375>,<8> I turn them into a soup.<6> Then I add a pat of <375>butter <375>on top. That extra touch of cream and salt makes the soup truly delicious!
FU Ev Harvest <367>I just love making a soup with lots of different <375>fish <375>in it,<8> <42>.<30><13>My trick is to squeeze a little <375>lemon<375> on top.<6> It mixes well with the other flavors and smells good.
FU Ev Harvest <28>So<2261> have you ever tried making <375>fruit soup<375>?<6> It's not just for dessert.<6> It works as a regular soup course too. <18>I've discovered that adding some <375>lemon <375>right before you serve it works well to keep it fresh.
FU Ev Harvest <18>OK,<2261> let me tell you.<30><13>I caught a lobster while free diving and used it to make <375>tom yum kung<375>.<30><214>When I added milk from a <375>coconut<375>,<8> it turned out great!<6> The perfect accent, and I highly recommend it.
FU Ev Harvest <13>OK!<8> Anytime you're cooking fish,<1172> it's crucial to use <375>lemon <375>or <375>vinegar <375>for flavor.<30>Which one tastes better depends on the type of fish you're cooking!

FU Ev Harvest <13>Here's my tip for baking a <375>fruit pie<375>.<6> Just accentuate the fruit's natural sweetness with a little honey! <18>And the best honey comes from the town's <375>beehives<375>.<6><214> It's the perfect dessert for the <375>Harvest Festival<375>!

FU Ev Harvest <13>Regular fruit pies are delicious,<8> but using <375>mixed fruits <375>makes a pie even better!<6> There's only one difference. I use a little <375>lemon <375>in mixed-fruit pies to temper the fruit's natural sweetness.<6> It's the perfect balance!
