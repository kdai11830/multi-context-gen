NPC Perio Good morning, Mayor <439>!
NPC Perio Good morning, <439>!
NPC Perio <214>Take a look in your mailbox.<6> I may have dropped a little something in there for you.
NPC Perio <214>As you can see, I'm busy delivering the mail this morning.
NPC Perio <945>Phew! <15>I swear...<15>huff...<15>these people are mailing bricks to each other just to spite me.
NPC Perio <617>Ya<8>a<8>a<8>a<8>a<8>awn<8>...<30>I was up late last night thinking about <375>Phyllis<375>. <6>Why do I always do this to myself? <214>Delivering the mail is my livelihood, so I can't afford to be tired.
NPC Perio Good evening, Mayor!
NPC Perio Hi there, <439>.
NPC Perio <28>Have you checked your mailbox?<6> <214>I just delivered a letter for you.
NPC Perio The evening shift is always the hardest. <6><214>It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it!
NPC Perio As soon as I clock out, I'm going to eat this fish I've been keeping in my bill pouch.<18>
NPC Perio Man, time flies when you're not using your wings. <6>It's already evening, for Pete's sake! <669>Ha! Get it?! <680>"For Pete's sake."<6> Because of my name? <6><110>Ha ha ha!<6> Oh, man.<6> I crack myself up. <16>Anyway<6>.<6>.<6>. <649>I wonder what <375>Phyllis<375> is doing tonight. Probably working.<16> Oh, erm...<15> Sorry. I get kind of loopy toward the end of my shift. <6><616>Catch ya later!
NPC Perio <1152><31>AHHH! <680>I'm behind schedule! Gotta get a move on!
NPC Perio <945>Wow, this mailbag is HEAVY!<6> Haven't these people ever heard of a phone conversation?
NPC Perio I can't make out the address on this letter because the handwriting is so sloppy. Not that I'm surprised. Most of the town's residents don't even have opposable thumbs.
NPC Perio <36>No time to talk!<680> Gotta get the rest of these letters delivered!
NPC Perio Sure, e-mail and text messages might be faster, more convenient, and better for the environment. <18>But there's nothing quite like receiving a handwritten letter in the mail. That's why I do it!
NPC Perio Whenever I see a letter that came from overseas, I think to myself:<30><669>"Wow, the bird who carried that must be EXHAUSTED!"
NPC Perio The residents of <107> sure send A LOT of letters.<30>Not that I'm complaining. <319>Job security, right?!
NPC Perio People sometimes think that all the letters are just magically delivered into their mailboxes. <36>That's not how it works at all.<16><30>I deliver each letter by hand, but I work so fast that nobody sees me drop the letters off. <25>I'm like a postal ninja!
NPC Perio <219>You know how there are two girls working at the post office, right?<30>There's <375>Pelly<375>, who works during the day,<6> and <375>Phyllis<375>, who works at night. This might be a weird question, but <28>who do you think is cuter?<2665><1099> Pelly. Phyllis. Umm...
NPC Perio <28>The rumor about me and <375>Pelly<375>?<680><619> Not true at all.<30><375>Pelly <375>is a really nice person and all,<6> but I just can't stop thinking about <375>Phyllis<375>. There's just something about her, you know?<30>But I guess I could see myself with <375>Pelly<375>. I don't know.<30>Anyway, thanks for listening.
NPC Perio <214>You know what today is, don't you?!<619> <87>It's WEDNESDAY!<30><214>Today's the day I ask <375>Phyllis<375><6> out to dinner!<30> I hope she says yes this time...
NPC Perio <87>AHHHHHHHH! <6>Guess what?<619> <212><375>Phyllis<375><6> blew me a kiss today!<30><367>She put her hand up to her mouth and went<6> <8> mwah<15>-choo!<15><30><53>Then she blew her nose into a tissue and someone said bless you.<6> Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <7>Whatever. <6>I know what I saw.
NPC Perio <6>Friday already? <6>That was quick.<30>I like to kick back on Friday nights and just let my feathers hang loose. <669><6>Makes me feel as free as a bird!<30><6>.<6>.<6>.<30><53>I wonder if <375>Phyllis<375> is free tonight.<6> <18>She's a bird too, you know. <40>It'd only make sense that she'd be up for it!
NPC Perio <38><375>Pelly<375>, huh?<30><18>Sure,<6> <375>Pelly <375>is great if you want a girl who's nice,<8263> sweet,<8263> and girly<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><25>But if you want a girl who's<8263> feisty,<8263> moody,<8263> and abrasive,<6> <375>Phyllis <375>is absolutely better. She can be a bit...<6>prickly...<6>at times,<6> but that's just the way she shows affection. <367>I just love the way her bill wrinkles up in disgust every time she sees me. I know what she really means...
NPC Perio <26><1152>WHOA!<6> Really?<6> I thought I was the only one who understood <375>Phyllis<375>'s charm and sophistication! <367>The cold, unfeeling eyes hidden under those long lashes...<30>The tangy smell of her feathers when she's molting...<30> <97>If only she were mine...
NPC Perio "Umm"? What do you mean,<6> "Umm"?<6> <28>You can't decide who's cuter?<30><214>If you're not sure, why not vote for<6> <375>Phyllis<375>?<30><16>She might come off as rude sometimes, but she's not rude.<6> She's just misunderstood. I really wish everyone could see what I see in her.
NPC Perio <649>Weather like this makes me want to stretch my wings and fly until the sun goes down! <214>I better deliver these letters quickly before the weather turns.
NPC Perio <7>I won't stop until <6>every<6> last<6> letter<6> is delivered to its intended recipient.<6> <128><1152>RAIN OR SHINE! <110>But I'm really glad it's sunny today.<214>
NPC Perio Hmm. <6>It's pretty gloomy out today.<30><214>Seems like a good day to stay inside and write a letter!<30><325>This message brought to you by the <107> post office.<286>
NPC Perio Oh... uh... hey, <439>.<30>I know I must really look like I just stepped out of the shower , but it's only because it's raining today. <354>I hope I don't run into <375>Phyllis <375>in this sad, soggy condition...
NPC Perio <110>Man,<6> it's raining cats and dogs out here today!<30><26> <680>.<680>.<680>.<30>Sorry.<6> Is that rude? <680>I don't want to upset any of our feline or canine residents.
NPC Perio <679><6>Br<27177><17185>r<27177><17185>r<27177><17185>r!<6> It's <6>so <6>cold<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>I can't feel my feathers!
NPC Perio <7>This blizzard is intense,<6> but I'll never give up!<680> I'll never quit!<6><30>Wherever mail sits undelivered...<619> Wherever letters lie unread...<619> That's where I'll be! Because I am a postman in the great city of <107>,<680> and the mail <128><15> MUST<16354>#x0;<3142> BE<9060> <2920>DELIVERED! <31>Man... <680>I wish <375>Phyllis <375>was here to hear that.
NPC Perio <214>Such beautiful and, <6>uh, <6>fragrant<6> weather we're having today.<30><617>It makes working so much<6> more<680> r <27187> <27189> <27191> <27193> <27195> <27197> g...
NPC Perio Hey! You have a letter from <375><22955>"<375>!<30>Oh,<15> but it looks like you have too many letters already and can't receive this one. Why don't you clear out some of your old letters, and I'll stop by later to deliver this one. All right?
NPC Perio You have a letter from <375><22955>"<375>!
NPC Perio OK, looks like you're all set!<6> <616>See you later!
NPC Perio <31>So many letters!<6> So little time!
NPC Perio <28>Read any good letters lately?<6> <669>Any with some juicy gossip?<30>Sorry.<6> None of my business.
NPC Perio I still have a lot of deliveries to make...
NPC Perio People say I talk too much while I'm out making deliveries.<6> I disagree.
NPC Perio A lot of people ask me why I walk instead of fly when I deliver the mail. Well, <36>flying is pretty exhausting when you're carrying a bag full of mail and packages. Also, there was this kid at my old job who used to knock me out of the sky with a slingshot. <354>Kind of ruined flying for me.
NPC Perio <1172><26> Oh, <439>!<6> Great timing!<30><214>I have an express delivery for you from <375><22955>"<375>.<30><16>I'll just stick it in your mailbox, so make sure you check it ASAP!<30><616>Catch you later!
NPC Perio <26>Oh, <6>great timing, <439>!<30>I have a bunch of letters addressed to you, but I can't deliver them because your mailbox is full! <18>Please clear out some of your old letters so I can deliver the new ones!
NPC Perio <26>Oh, <6>great timing, <439>!<30>I have a bunch of letters addressed to <802><27208>'s mailbox is full! <18>Could you ask <802> to clear out some old letters so I can deliver the new ones?
NPC Perio <616>I'm counting on you!
NPC Perio Also, please ask the other players who have full mailboxes to clear them out. <616>Thank you!
NPC Perio It would be a shame if a really important letter went undelivered because of a full mailbox. <214>I'm counting on you!
NPC Perio Well,<6> back to work!<6> <616>See ya!
NPC Perio I'd love to stay and chat, maybe have a cup of tea. But <375>Phyllis<375> would be really upset. <4837>She has eyes everywhere...<286>
