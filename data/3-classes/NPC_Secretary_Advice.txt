NPC Secretary Advice <41><439>, <28>have you ever written a <375>letter<375> before?<30><214>Everyone in town loves letters! Even close neighbors often send letters to each other, just because. We really do have a fantastic postal system, if I can boast for a moment or two... <53>If you want to write a letter,<1172> you'll need some <375>stationery<375><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Secretary Advice If you're OK with regular <375>lined paper<375>, I have some I can give you.<30>Just let me know when you have room for it in your pockets!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>If you're OK with regular <375>lined paper<375>, I have some I can give you. I want you to put it to good use!
NPC Secretary Advice You can use letters to greet new neighbors, introduce yourself, or for any reason whatsoever.<1172> Anyone would be happy to get a handwritten letter from you!<30><38>However, sometimes townsfolk get so happy they show off any old letters they get to other people<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. I'd advise you not to write anything you wouldn't want others to see. Just assume everyone will read it.
NPC Secretary Advice <53>When you want to write a letter, press or touch on the Touch Screen to access your pockets<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <214>Select the <375>stationery<375> from your pockets, and then choose <375>Write a Letter<375>! <16>Next choose the name of the person you're sending it to. Then write the contents of the letter! <214>After that, you can attach an item from your pockets as a present.<30><16>Once your letter is ready to send, you can mail it using the <375>post office <375>on Main Street!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>Are you all set on how to mail letters?<30><16>I could give you some new advice or talk about letters again. <28>Which would you prefer?<1308><1099> New advice! More about letters!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>I can do that!<619> <53>Hmmm<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Then<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6> <26> Ah!<670> I know!
NPC Secretary Advice <41><439>, have you been <28>to the <375>beach <375>yet?<30><214>This town has two slopes you can use to get down to the beach!<30><53>If you have a fishing rod or a wet suit, you can fish or dive and have a lot of fun down there<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <367>It's so relaxing to just listen to the waves and walk along the beach collecting seashells! <1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <28073> why don't the two of us go down there together right now! <219>It would be nice to find a <375>seashell<375> to take home as a souvenir of our little trip<8>.<8>.<8>. <1172><26> Ah!<670> <318>Oh my!<670> I should apologize!<6> That was too bold of me, wasn't it?<30><31>Really, it would be enough if you from time to time pressed to quickly pick up some seashells. <212>If you happen to go down to the beach and remember that,<1172> it would be a nice thing to do<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.for me.
NPC Secretary Advice Have you <28>been to the <375>beach <375>yet?<619> <214>Our town has two slopes you can use to get down there. <16>It can be really relaxing to walk along the beach listening to the waves and picking up seashells. <214>You should head down there if you have the time!
NPC Secretary Advice <219>Also, it would make me really happy if<1172> you'd pick me up a <375>seashell<375> as a souvenir of your little trip there<8>.<8>.<8>. <1172><26> Ah!<670> <318>Oh no!<670> I should <1172>apologize!<6> That was rather bold of me, wasn't it? <31>Really, I'd be fine if you would just<1172> occasionally use to quickly pick up seashells from time to time. <212>If you HAPPEN to go down to the beach and HAPPEN to remember,<1172> I certainly wouldn't mind<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Secretary Advice <219>Also, it would make me really happy if you'd pick me up a <375>seashell<375> as a souvenir of your little trip there<8>.<8>.<8>.<796><1099> Seashell? Here you go! ...
NPC Secretary Advice <26> Ah!<670> <318>Oh no!<670> I should apologize!<6> That was rather bold of me, wasn't it? <31>Really, I'd be happy if you just occasionally used to quickly pick up seashells from time to time! <212>If you happen to go down to the beach and remember for me,<1172> I'd really love that<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Secretary Advice <72> Oh my!<6> You actually remembered to bring me a seashell?!
NPC Secretary Advice <141>Thank you so much!<670> I'll put it in my room and take good care of it!<30><367>I think decorating a room with seashells can make for very interesting interior design! <16>Also, you can sell seashells at the recycle shop for a handful of Bells!<30><214><41><439>,<1172> I'd love for you to see all sorts of different shells and find the one you like the most! <16><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><26>Ah!<1172> I know!<670> <16>Please take this as thanks for the seashell<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Secretary Advice <214>My mom recently sent me a box with <77><834>. Actually, she sent 3! And she specifically told me I should share them with people because <18>that's what good puppies do. <16>This town is known for the <1622> because it's the local fruit... But my hometown is famous for the <834><28093> so you can eat them, <1172>sell them,<1172> plant them,<1172> or do whatever you'd like! By the way, if you sell them, you'll get more Bells than when you sell a regular old <1622>.<30><16>I hear there are people who grow a lot of rare fruits like these in order to make a nice living for themselves. <41><439>,<1172> <28>why not give it a try?<619> <214>If you have a <375>shovel<375>, it's actually quite easy to plant and grow them.
NPC Secretary Advice You can buy shovels at <375>Timmy and Tommy's store <375>near the entrance of the shopping district! They sell different things every day,<1172> so sometimes they might not have one in stock, of course. But if they don't, just check back another day. They'll have one soon enough! It's where I got mine! <214>If you bring your shovel here, I can teach you how to plant trees, plus do some other nifty tricks!
NPC Secretary Advice Ah!<8> Right,<8> <53>I said I'd teach you how to plant trees.<8> Well...
NPC Secretary Advice Since you're carrying a shovel, <214>I'll give you some pointers on raising fruit trees! <16>First, use your shovel to dig a hole where you'd like to plant your tree.<30>Then,<1172> select the fruit you want to plant from your pockets and choose <375>Bury<375>. <214>It's quite simple! <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><16>However, there are things you can do to make sure your tree grows nice and strong. For example, where you plant it will make a huge difference<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><53>Somewhere like in the shadow of a building or too close to another tree or next to a river or next to a cliff<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30>If you plant in places like those, the tree won't grow up strong.<1172> It'll just end up wilting! <214>So when you choose a place to plant a tree,<1172> make sure you give it plenty of space to grow!
NPC Secretary Advice <53>If you have a shovel, you can bury things, but you can also dig up things that were previously buried<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16><41><439>, <28>do you by any chance know how to dig things up?<619> <214>I can teach you if you'd like.<796><797> Teach me! I already know how.
NPC Secretary Advice <214>Of course.<670> Leave it to me!<30>Have you ever been walking around outside and noticed a mark <28>on the ground? <214>That mark means something's buried there that can be dug up with your shovel. Sometimes, you might even be lucky and find a <375>fossil<375>!<30><16>However,<671> amateurs like us <561>can't tell what kind of fossil it is or its value just by looking at it. <25>But never fear!<30><214>At the edge of the shopping district is a <375>museum<375>. If you take your fossils there, they'll be assessed for free! If you donate them to the museum,<8> <18>we'll have a better collection in our museum for everyone to see. I'm sure the museum curator, <375>Blathers<375>, will be delighted as well!<30><13>You can also take assessed fossils<8> to <375>Re-Tail <375>and sell them for a fair amount of Bells. <219>As a staff member of the town hall, I love seeing the museum develop as a result of donations<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <214>But feel free to do whatever works best for you, <439>!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>I'm glad to hear that!<619> Please use your shovel to dig up all sorts of things! <16>I can't think of anything else I need to tell you about shovels,<8> so let me think of some other advice to give. <53>Hmmm<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6> <26><1172>Ah, why don't we talk about some of the things people do for fun in our town?
NPC Secretary Advice This area has a lot of natural resources, so you can find many different kinds of fish and bugs. <214>That's why there are so many people who've made fishing or bug catching their hobby. <53><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>Actually, it's more than a hobby. Everyone around here makes a lot of money catching fish and bugs<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16>You can find <375>fishing rods<375> for fishing and <375>nets <375>for bug catching at <375>Timmy and Tommy's store<375> periodically. If you see them, be sure to pick them up right away!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>During this season, I'd recommend both fishing and bug catching!<30><16>By the way, <439>,<1172> which do you think <28>you'd like to try first?<1308><1099> Fishing! Bug catching!
NPC Secretary Advice <53>Since it's winter right now, you can't find many bugs outside, so I'd recommend fishing at the moment<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16><41><439>,<1172> which do you think <28>you'd like to try first?<1308><1099> Fishing! Bug catching!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>In that case, why don't you use this as an opportunity to make your fishing debut?
NPC Secretary Advice <214>In that case, why don't you use this as an opportunity to make your debut as a bug catcher?

NPC Secretary Advice <214>Well, good!<6> I hope you're having a lot of fun!<30>And I look forward to checking out your encyclopedia, <439>!
NPC Secretary Advice <1172><26> Oh! Let me explain the basics of fishing to you then.<30>Fish live in the ocean, rivers, and ponds. So, you know, in water.<30>If you look very carefully, you'll sometimes see the shadow of a fish.<30>When you see a shadow, aim for near the fish's head and press to cast your line. Make sure you have your fishing rod equipped first, of course!<30>If the fish realizes something's there, it'll move closer to it.<30>Once it bites and the bobber drops below the water's surface, press again to reel it in! <214>If you press the button quick enough before it gets away, you can catch it. Give it a try. And good luck!
NPC Secretary Advice <1172><26> Oh no! In that case, <16>I'll go ahead and explain the basics of bug catching to you. Depending on the type of bug,<1172> they might be flying,<1172> sitting on trees or flowers,<1172> or even hiding in places. Equip your net first. Then if you spot a bug, press to swing the net and catch it! If you miss your bug, it might get scared and run away, so be careful where you swing your net! <16>By the way, if you hold down , you can get your net ready and creep closer to the bugs<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. I recommend you try that when you want to sneak up on a bug without it noticing you! <214>That's about all you need to know to catch bugs, so get out there and give it a try. Good luck!
NPC Secretary Advice <214>Oh!<670> Of course!<6><30><53>Let's see<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. According to your fish encyclopedia<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Secretary Advice Oh dear me<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6> That is indeed a problem<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><53>In that case, why don't you buy one of the ones we keep here at the town hall for situations like this<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>?
NPC Secretary Advice <214>When you have the space for it,<1172> I can let you have one of ours if you bring me <375>500 Bells<375>.
NPC Secretary Advice If you bring me <375>500 Bells<375>, I can let you have one from the town hall. <28>Would you like to do that?<796><797> I'll buy it! I don't need it yet.

NPC Secretary Advice <214>Understood!<619> Then please take this <375>fishing rod <375>home with you!
NPC Secretary Advice To use the <375>fishing rod<375>, first you have to equip it from your pockets<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30>Stand near the water's edge. If you see a fish's shadow, aim near it,<1172> press , and cast your bobber. When the fish takes the bait and the bobber drops completely under the surface of the water,<8> press again. <214>You can reel in the fish if you press the button quickly before it gets away. Anyway, give it a try! After you catch <375>three different types <375>of fish,<1172> come back again to show me your encyclopedia!
