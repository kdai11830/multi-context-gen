OT Dt Museum_Art <13>This place is so much better than a stuffy old art museum where they make you walk a particular route. <103>Here you can spend as much or as little time as you want looking at your favorites.<8> <41><42>!
OT Dt Museum_Art <13>I like to imagine decorating my own house with all the best artwork in this gallery. <44>And maybe someday, <8>when I strike it rich,<8> I'll actually take one home with me.
OT Dt Museum_Art <53>I don't understand what makes a painting a classic. <8><2289>But I'll tell you one thing:<8><561> it isn't the clothing. <36>Everything in old paintings is out of style. <31179><2289><110>Who thought that satin pantaloons were a good look?
OT Dt Museum_Art <13>Do you know how to fully appreciate paintings,<8> <70>?<649><8> I start by imagining the artists. <28>What kind of life did they have?<8> What was their inspiration?<8> Did they know their work would be timeless?
OT Dt Museum_Art <53>You know,<8> I've done some modeling.<8> I wonder if there's an artist in <107> who would paint me? <319>I'm a natural! <2289>And it would be a fabulous way to preserve my beauty for future generations.
