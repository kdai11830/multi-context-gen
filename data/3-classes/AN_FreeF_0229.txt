AN FreeF 0229 I just realized that February 29th only comes during leap years!<30><36>A day this rare should probably be a bigger deal.<15><87> There should be, like, a leap festival or something!<30><31>Gah! We're not ready!
AN FreeF 0229 <13>A normal year has 365 days, right?<15><16> And this year is a leap year, so it has 366 days! <44>Talking about it gets me super excited about time and space and stuff like that!<690>
AN FreeF 0229 <7><41><70>!<6> Live every leap day like it's your last leap day! Yeah! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeF 0229 <13>Heh. Talking about all this sciencey stuff makes me feel super smart! <6><41><42>!
AN FreeF 0229 <18>Leap years are famous for having an extra day.<15><28> But do you know why there's an extra day? <53>We divide a year into an even 365 days, but a year is actually more like 365.25 days long. <18>So those leftover quarter days build until we have one full extra day every fourth year! <87>It's like we're saving up bonus points to buy an extra day! Kinda cool, huh? <6><41><42>!
AN FreeF 0229 Ack! It's a leap year! <36>And of course I'm totally unprepared. But what is there to do, really?
AN FreeF 0229 <18>It's cool that leap days only come once every four years, but that's pretty much all there is to 'em!
AN FreeF 0229 <18>I guess I should have started planning something four years ago. <6><41><42>!
AN FreeF 0229 <649>Maybe I'll start working on some stuff to do for the leap day that happens four years from now<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>
AN FreeF 0229 <38>It's not like other events where everyone buys clothes and presents and bakes cookies, <6><42>!<15><13>
