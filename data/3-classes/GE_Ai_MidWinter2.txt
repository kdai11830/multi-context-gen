GE Ai MidWinter2 <26>Gah! Who IS that?! <6>Oh, it's only you, <70>. <6>Sorry, but all this extra darkness is freaking me out!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <87><41><613>Woohoo<614>! Gotta keep spreading the happy dance around today... Because this double-dark day is super dreary to some neighbors!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <214>It's going to stay this dark for a LONG time today, <70>.<30><110>It's like <375>Halloween<375>, but without all the scary costumes, <42>!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <28>Wondering what I'm doing outside on a weird day like this, <70>? <616>Trying to soak up some moon rays! It should make me look ghostly or something, <42>!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <13>The sun isn't coming out today, so it's the perfect day for doing what I do BEST. <319>Letting my inner star SHINE!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <28>Wait a sec? What time is it?<6> Ohmigosh! I have no idea!<30><31>Ack! Too much darkness! I feel like I'm floating in space, <42>!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <214>This night has been going on, like, forever and ever. Am I sleepy? Am I awake? <36>I don't know!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <219>OK, look down... Look around... It's been so dark today... <214>I'm scared I'll fall into holes!
GE Ai MidWinter2 <28>How're you doing with this eternal darkness today, <70>?<30><13>Don't let it get to you. The sun will be back soon. <31>Unless it's gone completely insane!
