OT Ai MidWinter2 <13><41><613>Hello<614>, <70>. Enjoying the solstice? Night during the day IS an acquired taste.
OT Ai MidWinter2 All this sunlessness... It's just so disorienting, <70>.
OT Ai MidWinter2 <26>Is that you, <70>?! <13>Oh, good. I can barely see anything in all this dark solstice gloom.
OT Ai MidWinter2 <28>Still surviving the daylong gloom,<8> <70>? We've got HOURS of <375>Winter Solstice<375> ahead of us<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Ai MidWinter2 <41><613>Well,<8> hello again<614>.<2289> <28>Where ARE you getting all your energy from? <6><354>I'm fizzling out. I'm really looking forward to the sun coming back tomorrow, <8><70>.
OT Ai MidWinter2 It's going to get very chilly once the sun goes down. <2289>Well, <1172>that is, <1172>when the sun doesn't go down<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> Because it <287>never <1172>came <1172>up!<6> <36>Sorry. <2289>I'm still upset about this whole <375>Winter Solstice<375>,<8> <70>.
OT Ai MidWinter2 <41><613>Good evening<614>, <70>. It's seriously getting chilly tonight, isn't it! <679>So cold...
OT Ai MidWinter2 <679>We really should get inside, <8>or else they'll dig us out of a snowbank NEXT <375>Winter Solstice<375>,<8> <70>!
OT Ai MidWinter2 <679>Stay warm, <70>. The solstice is only going to make tonight even colder, <42>...
