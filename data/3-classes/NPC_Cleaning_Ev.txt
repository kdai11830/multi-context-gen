NPC Cleaning Ev <214>Once again, we'll be pulling weeds<105> and making the town look happy!
NPC Cleaning Ev The very last Friday of April is a special day where people pitch in and help <25>pull weeds all over town!
NPC Cleaning Ev <16><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><214>But <107> is already done with the weed pulling.<1172> Everything is already beautiful and happy!
NPC Cleaning Ev <219>I actually have special rewards for <107> since everyone here just loves tidying up so much. <214>Also, I've got something I want to give you, <439>, so make some room in your pockets and see me!
NPC Cleaning Ev <219>For the tidiness-loving people of <107>, I have<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Cleaning Ev <31>Look around! <41><107> is overrun with weeds! Oh my!
NPC Cleaning Ev I gather <107> has really been neglecting its weed pulling for a bit,<1172> <28>or am I completely wrong?
NPC Cleaning Ev Even a single weed can be such an eyesore, <28>don't you agree?
NPC Cleaning Ev <214>Let's get out and pluck all the nasty weeds before sunset, OK?<30><141>I will, of course, be assisting you as official weed counter, so you have nothing to worry about at all! <16> Finally, I want to tell you that I've got a special gift to give you, <616>so come pick it up when we're done!
NPC Cleaning Ev <616>Heya heya, hey there. Nice to meet you, I mean.<30><214>Usually I'm the guy who runs the flower shop on Main Street.<30><16>But for today, the shop is closed down<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> <219>I mean, well<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.
NPC Cleaning Ev I have a special commemorative present for you too, <439>, so be sure to come and get it later.
NPC Cleaning Ev <26>Oh!<7739> <16>You have space for my prize now? <219>My reward for the cleanliness- loving people of <107> is<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.

NPC Cleaning Ev <214>Looks like we still have a ways left to go, but we'll do our best, right?
NPC Cleaning Ev <214>Our target is in sight! Don't give up hope!
NPC Cleaning Ev <214>We're really down to the very last bit now. Let's stick to it!
NPC Cleaning Ev <616>Ah, <670><439>!<6> Congratulations! <141>There are now no more weeds left anywhere in town!<680> We did it! <16>So now I'll award<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670><105>the final, special reward to commemorate this great and happy occasion!
NPC Cleaning Ev <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>Or at least that's what I'd like to do, but, <439>, right now your pockets seem to be kind of full. <44>Hey, before I go home and forget about your reward, can you put something away and come back?

NPC Cleaning Ev <219>I really put my heart and soul into making your gift, so I hope it makes you truly happy!
NPC Cleaning Ev This town is already plenty tidy, but there are so many other towns out there overrun with weeds. <219>If you hear your friend's town has turned into a real jungle, I hope you'll go give that friend a hand!
NPC Cleaning Ev <141>Happily, this town is now shipshape from top to bottom!<30><16>Oh, but <20476> <20476> .<670>there are still many towns in the world currently drowning in unhappy oceans of weeds. <219>If you hear about a friend's town in need of some rescuing, please help save that town, OK?
