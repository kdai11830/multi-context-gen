NPC Jonny <617>Oh<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Are you my princess?<15> <141>Kiss me and wake me from my endless slumber! <121><1152>Hey, wait a sec!<15> Just who are you?! You don't look like no princess!<30><25>I'm <375>Gulliver<375>,<6> just a humble little sailor of some note around the seven or eight seas.<30><28>Wait?<6> Could it be that YOU were the one who saved me?<30><31><1152>Oh my gosh!<15> What have I done!<30>I can't believe I was so rude to my rescuer!<6> Find it in your heart to forgive me!<2289> That's what heroes do! <354>Huh, I'm actually very confused at this exact moment.<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>I guess I went overboard and was tossed into the sea.<2289> Gah,<8> typical.<30><16>Probably my fault for dozing off on the side of a ship in the middle of the BIGGEST storm ever. <36>I don't have a single memory of what happened after that.<2289> Sea amnesia, they call it. <53>Come to think of it,<6> I'm pretty sure I was on my way to someplace or another, since,<25853>#xE;<2289> I'm a sailor. Hmmm. Where was I headed<8>.<8>.<8>.<15>? If I could at least remember the name of the silly place<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <616>Good morning!<6> And how is this fine day treating you?<30><319>I'm <375>Gulliver<375>,<6> a pure-blooded boy of the sea.<25855>#xE;<25856>#xE;<2289> <25>I'm a man of the sea!<2289> Not a boy anymore! <16>Would you listen to my manly tale?!<30><53>I fell overboard in a pirate scuffle and was dumped into the ocean.<6> Had to be 10no,<6> 50 pirates! Next thing I knew,<2289> I was on this beach,<8> snoffing salt water from my manly beak<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><26>"Canoe" believe it?<15> "Buoy" that was a close one!<30><6>.<6>.<6>.<6><31><1152>You<6><1152> were supposed to laugh!<15> I put together a self-deprecating joke and a pun.<2289> Height of comedy. <354>Please<6> don't make me explain my jokes<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><38>Ah, it seems my ability to make people laugh is lost to the cruel mistress of the sea. <8>.<8>.<8>.<6><28>Hey?<15> That's not the only thing I've lost.<30>I can't seem to remember a bunch of stuff!<25861>#xE;<453> <53>I think I had that once.<8> Maybe? So just where<6> was I headed?<30><318>Oh, man!<6> This sure is a fuzzy pickle!<15> I'm in way over my head here!
NPC Jonny <31><1152>No!<6> Lizzy!<6> <1152>Go away!<30> <1152>STAY AWAY<1152> FROM ME!<286><30><286><354><6>.<6>.<6>.<15><121>Gasp! Gasp I say!<6> Am I<15> in the Overthere?<30><72>If so, you must be an angel, right?<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<6><38>Ah, <6>guess not.<6><30><214>My name is <375>Gulliver<375>!<6> I happen to be a simple sailor who travels the seven seas, searching for an eighth. <28>Who?<453> <18>Oh, <6>Lizzy is the name of an old girlfriend of mine<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><40>Nah, I'm just foolin' ya.<6> It's the name of the hurricane that attacked me!<2289> <669>WHOOSH! <367>Lizzy sure was a rough dame.<15> <325>Well, <286><325><325>hurricane<325>.<286><30><325><286><36>After all,<2289> she completely blew all my memories clean from my head!<30>I'm pretty sure I was heading somewhere.<15> I just can't remember where that somewhere was<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <6><167><1152>GAH!<286><286><15> <286>What<286><6> happened to me?!<286><30><31><1152>Where am I?!<6> <1152>Am I <375>Gulliver<375>?!<30><26>Hey!<6> I remembered my name!<619> <214>Nice to meet you!<8> My name is <375>Gulliver<375>!<2289> I'm a sailor, of course. <212>Oh, man.<6> I think my cage got rattled pretty bad.<2289> I'm feeling a little birdbrained at the moment. <53>Get it? <6>Cause I'm a bird<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<619> <110>HA!<8> HA!<8> HA!<6> I quack me up!<15><214><30><6>So<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Hmmm.<15> You're acting pretty calm about all this.<30>So, <3407>. Cool Cat<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> Will you listen to my sad tale of doom and gloom?<30><354>Truth is,<6> I fell over the side of my boat and was swept away by the waves. Er,<2289> <31>it was because of a 90-foot SEA MONSTER!<15> No,<6> <26>TWO!<6> <36>Hate when that happens<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> Blasted monsters stole my memory.<6> And my sandwich.<30><53>Where was my boat headed before it was hurled off course<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<30><31>I can't seem to remember,<6> even with my trusty thinking cap on!
NPC Jonny <286> Ach...<6> <286><638><1152>ACHOOOOOO!<286><286><286><30><286><286><679>I'm so cold!<6> Just how long was I out soaking in the deep blue, anyway<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<30><354>The tips of my wings are wrinkled like sad, depressed seaweed.<30><26>Oh!<6> Where are my manners!<6> <319>I'm the jaunty sailor of the seven seas, <375>Gulliver<375>!<30>But<6> I can't seem to remember much more than that<8>.<8>.<8>.<30>I must have ambrosia<8> or amnesty<8> or something equally as serious.<30><53>I'm pretty sure I was on my way to someplace super fun, though<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I just can't remember where<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><31>Squaaaawwwk!<6> Where in the whole wide world was I sailing to?!
NPC Jonny <23>Oh, I know!<2289> It's so obvious!<97> <214>Will you help me figure out where I was heading?<849><796><797> Sure, I'll help you out. Sorry. I'm kinda busy.
NPC Jonny <26>Oh, I know!<6> You gotta help me!<15><30><16>I'll tell you everything I remember,<2289> so will you please, please<6> help me figure out where I was headed? <248>You wouldn't abandon a poor yet manly seagull like me, would you?<849><796><797> Sure, I'll help you out. Sorry. I'm kinda busy.
NPC Jonny <87>You mean it?!<6> I haven't met such a noble skipper since old Bobbery of Rogueport!<2289> Not even close! <18>Now,<2289> I suppose we should start with anything and everything I can remember about where I was going! <16><8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <87>Oh, thanks!<6> I haven't met someone so willing to help a total stranger since the residents of Ricco Harbor! <18>All right,<6> I'll tell you everything I remember about my destination before my mind goes blank. <16><8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <50><8>.<8>.<8>.<6>The chill of the Ice Cavern is nothing compared to getting the cold shoulder<8>.<8>.<8>. <7>Don't be one of those uncaring city folk my mom warned me about.<6> <31>Take time to help your fellow bird! <18>Now,<6> I'll start by telling you everything I can remember.<30><16><8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <36>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>I guess I must seem very suspicious to you or something.<30><18>Helping people builds good karma,<15> so just help me figure this out, OK?<30><214>All right, let's get started.<6> I'm going to start telling you everything I remember. <16><8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <214>I promise I'll send you a fancy souvenir!<6> It might take a while, but you'd better get your hopes up!
NPC Jonny .<6>.<6>.<6>Somehow, I think that's wrong.<30><18>But<15> I'll put my faith in you and make my way there anyway!<2289> What's stoppin' me, right?! <214>Who knows? I might even send you a token from my voyage!<6> It'll be small, so check your mailbox!
NPC Jonny <25882>Mya... Mya<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Uh, <6>unnnnnn<8>.<8>.<8>.<2289> I am the alpha male<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Nah, mom<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Just give me<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Five more minutes...
NPC Jonny <1152>Oh!<6> No!<6> That's the port side! <25882>Starboard is on the right<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30>It's because all starfish are right-handed<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Zzzzzz...
NPC Jonny <25882>No<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Today isn't a school day<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Yeah, I checked<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Zzzzzz...
NPC Jonny <25882>Nnnnnnnn<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> Don't do that<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> My beak isn't a can opener<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Nnnnnn<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Cinnamon buns are not currency<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Not yet, anyway<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Zzz<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <1152>GAH!<15> Nope, I'm still sleeping. Zzz<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Zzzz<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I can't believe how seriously unconscious I am right now<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25882>Mmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Lizzy<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> But you were my lobster<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <87>I'm just going to explore a bit before I take off again!
NPC Jonny <18>I never get seasick!<6> The rocking feels as if it was my own mother rocking me to sleep. However,<6> I think I might be landsick.<30><354>Burble blurble...<15> Ugh, just talking about it is making me go from groggy to gloomy super quick<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <87>Voyaging by boat is fun!<6> The sea breeze takes all your cares away and turns them to sea salt! <18>If something bad ever happens to you,<6> hop on a boat and take to the high seas! <354>Well,<6> unless your troubles all have to do with being stranded out at sea<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <367>The sea is fantastic!<6> If you're sad or worried,<6> the sea will wrap you in her arms like you're a baby in a blanket! <214>She's just like my mom back home!<30> <8>.<8>.<8>.<6>It's been a long time since I've had her spaghetti and wormballs...
NPC Jonny <25>The boat I was riding on is way different from Mr. <375>Kapp'n<375>'s!<30>It has the latest doodads and super- deluxe thingamabobbers!<30><36>Still wasn't enough to keep me from going overboard, though.
NPC Jonny <25>This outfit I'm wearing is the very symbol of a sailor!<2289> Plus it makes me look incredibly charming! <319>Charm<25886><25887><2289> it'd just look silly to find me lying here on the beach. <53>Can you imagine the look on your face if I were dressed as a cowboy?<15> <23>Ooh,<6> that's not a bad idea<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <36>This town<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>is definitely one of the smallest ports I've ever been to.<30><110>With all the seas I've traveled and towns I've been to,<6> this one feels like a tiny hamster cage!<15><16> <18>I'm not saying <214>it feels TOO small, though.<25888><25889><2289> I've seen bigger. <649>Hoo, now Isle Delfino!<2289> THAT was a nice beach to wash up on<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <25>Just between the two of us,<6> I've actually traveled the vastness of space as well! <36>However,<6> no one I've ever talked to believes any of my many harrowing tales of adventure. But let me tell you one thing I learned when floatin' about out there.<619> <6><669><670><1152>Space is DARK!<15><16>
NPC Jonny <561>I never thought a seagull like me would be such dead weight once I hit the water. <36>When I was a chick,<6> I went to swim classes every week,<6> though I did have water wings as a backup<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <87>I'm quite happy we had a chance to meet like this!<15> I hope we can share another tale or two! <561>But <6>I'm a man of the sea<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> <36>I might never return to this port!<2289> Yep, bet you'll never see me again! <616>Either way,<25893><2289> <110>Ha HAH!<2289> That's a good one<8>.<8>.<8>.
NPC Jonny <6><18756>AYE AYE, SIR!<286><30><286>Wait.<15><121><1152> How did you know my name i<286>s <375>Gulliver<375>?!<30><53>Hmmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Come to think of it,<2289> have we met somewhere before?<30><23>Oh!<6> I see!<15> I lost my memories and can't remember important stuff!<453> <7>Must be the sea amnesia! <16>It tends to act up now and again,<6> <31>especially at a time of least convenience! Point is,<2289> I'm pretty sure I was headed somewhere,<2289> but I can't remember where that was! <248>You have to help me!<6> Please help me try to refresh my lost and battered memory!<25902>#xE;<849><796><797> Sure thing. I'm kinda busy.
