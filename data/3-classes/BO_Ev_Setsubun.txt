BO Ev Setsubun <26> Augh!<6> It's an ogre!
BO Ev Setsubun <121><1152>Augh!<6> An ogre!<6> <679>Those fangs are freaking me out,<8> <42>!<6>
BO Ev Setsubun <72><1152>Augh!<6> I didn't know that ogres actually existed,<8> <42>!
BO Ev Setsubun Shoo!<6> Get outta here, ogre!<6> And gimme some good luck today!
BO Ev Setsubun <214>It wouldn't be <375>Bean Day<375> without some good old-fashioned bean throwing! I didn't hurt you, did I?<6> Sorry about that,<8> <42>!
BO Ev Setsubun I sure hope all this bean throwing will keep us safe from ogres.<6> My arm's getting tired!
BO Ev Setsubun <28>That didn't do anything?<619> <72>You must be trying to trick me!<30><110>You can't fool me, ogre!<6> I'm gonna keep throwing beans at you all day!<6><214>
BO Ev Setsubun <31><1152>AUGH!<6> Where'd you get those beans, ogre?!<30>It's not fair!<6> You can throw them or get them thrown at you,<6> but not both!
BO Ev Setsubun <121><1152>Nooo!<6> It's a bean-toting ogre!<619> <31>We're all doomed, <8><42>!
BO Ev Setsubun <72>Hey!<6> Ogre!<15> <7>I'm gonna bean you good!<30>Wait. <6><28>What?<15> You've got beans too?<6> <248>But how can that beeeeee, <8><42>!
BO Ev Setsubun <649>Man, <6>I could eat a whole mountain of beans.
BO Ev Setsubun <214>It's <375>Bean Day<375>,<6> and I'm psyched to use my beans to chase off some ogres,<8> <42>! Even though I'm still kind of scared of them<8>.<8>.<8>.
BO Ev Setsubun <53>So<6> is it true the only thing that really works against ogres is<8>.<8>.<8>.beans?
BO Ev Setsubun <26>Look at all those beans you've got there, <70>!<30><214>I hope you're using them to fight bad luck<6> and not just to, like, make chili or something.
BO Ev Setsubun I know I'm not an ogre,<6> but I don't mind if you throw some beans at me, <70>. <367>I could use a quick snack right about now,<8> <42>.
BO Ev Setsubun <219>You lucky duck! <6>You've got some beans!<6> Their taste is mild, but they're still good! <214>To be honest,<6> I think throwing them is kind of a waste,<6> even if it does get rid of ogres,<8> <42>.
BO Ev Setsubun <214>I'm happy to see you and I are both totally stocked with beans.<6> We are ready to fight bad luck! <25>Now we just gotta wait for some ogres to stumble by,<8> <42>.
BO Ev Setsubun <214>Looks like we're both all set in the bean department, huh?<619> <53>Now all we need is an ogre,<8> <42>.
BO Ev Setsubun <28>Are your beans for warding off bad luck?<6> Or are they for eating?<619> <87>I love how versatile beans are!
BO Ev Setsubun <7>Step back, ogre!<6> Or get ready to taste my beany wrath!<30><6><50>Oh no!<97> Where'd my beans run off to,<8> <42>?
BO Ev Setsubun <31>Ogres aren't allowed in my house!<6> Get out of here,<8> <42>!
BO Ev Setsubun It's weird to say,<6> but I feel kind of bad for you,<6> what with everyone throwing beans at you. <219>I guess you can hang out in my house for a while if you want,<8> <42>.
