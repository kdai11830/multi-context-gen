OT FreeE Event <28>Kind of a slow week ahead in <107>, <8>wouldn't you say? No fun events on the horizon. <53>Well,<8> I guess it's a chance to catch up on some housekeeping or <8>pull some weeds. <23><2289>Maybe I'll go fishing!
OT FreeE Event Help me, <8><70>. <2289>I'm bored! <28>What do you do when there aren't any events coming up? <649>I guess I could write some letters<8> or go shopping <8>or explore the outskirts of <107><8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <26><41><42>,<8> I've got to get on all those things!<2289> <31>Now I'm super busy!
OT FreeE Event <28>You know what?<2289> I can't think of a single event coming up soon.<30><53>I guess that means I'll finally have time to catch up on my weeding.<30><72>And my shell collection could use a little work.<2289> Some pretty ones have been washing up recently. <38>Come to think of it,<8> I don't have any time for events!<2289> <41><42>!
