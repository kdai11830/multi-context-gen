GE Dt Museum_Fossil <214>Fossils are crusty in the ground, but they really come to life in here, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Fossil <53>I wonder.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>are these fossils crunchy like a really good snack, <42>?
GE Dt Museum_Fossil <25>I love standing next to all these dry fossils! It makes me look so fresh, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Fossil <31>Just thinking about dinosaurs makes me nervous! They'd either stomp on me.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>or eat me, right?
GE Dt Museum_Fossil <28>Will I be a fossil someday?<619> <110>I bet I'd make a cute one, <42>!
