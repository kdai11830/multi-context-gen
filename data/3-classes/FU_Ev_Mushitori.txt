FU Ev Mushitori <87>Today is the <375>Bug-Off<375>!<619> Most of the time my net stays empty,<8> but today I'm determined to catch a big one!

FU Ev Mushitori <214>The weather sure is great today for catching bugs!<6> Just be sure to sneak up on them from downwind,<8> right?
FU Ev Mushitori <214>Have you caught any bugs yet?<619><212> I've been swinging my net an awful lot,<8> but I've mostly been catching grass.
FU Ev Mushitori <219>This morning<1172> I read a book on the habitats of different insect species.<6> I wanted to catch one of everything. <38>But I guess theory and practice are two different things.
FU Ev Mushitori There isn't much time left in the <375>Bug-Off<375>, so<8><669><6> give it all you've got!<30><214>We may be rivals in this tournament,<8> but I always cheer on my friends!
FU Ev Mushitori <31>What am I going to do?!<6> The <375>Bug-Off<375> will be over soon!<30><7>I need to find the perfect bug!<6> <40>I'm going to end this tournament with my net held high.

FU Ev Mushitori <214>I've improved a lot at catching bugs! <6>But I shouldn't get overconfident,<8> or next time I might not win an award.

FU Ev Mushitori <214>Today's <375>Bug-Off <375>has furthered my interest in entomology.<6> That's the study of insects,<8> you know. In fact,<8> when I get home,<40> I think I'll crack open my encyclopedia!
