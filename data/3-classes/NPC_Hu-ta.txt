NPC Hu-ta <212>Oh dear. <1172>Pardon me...
NPC Hu-ta <31>Hoo! <1172>I'm a bit of a night owl. Drowsy in the daytime, you see!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Hoo! I welcome you to the <45><107> Museum.
NPC Hu-ta <6>Welcome to the <45><107> Museum.
NPC Hu-ta Take your time... Do look around...
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our museum is second to none, may I humbly say. Brimming with fish!<1172> Chock full of fossils! And blessed with every work of art! <141>Yes, the <107> museum is extraordinary. <1172>Hootie hoo!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our collections are quite extensive. Our exhibits, exemplary. Do enjoy yourself thoroughly!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our insect exhibit is unparalleled! Visitors do, <1172>shall I say, <1172>swarm here from all over to see it. Please enjoy the collection, and then spread, <1172>if I dare, <1172>the buzz.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our aquarium is truly outstanding! Indeed, <1172>we reel in visitors from far and wide. So please be sure to enjoy our fascinating fish. I think you'll get along, <1172>if I may, <1172>swimmingly.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our fossil collection is especially superb, you know. The exhibit here is anything but dry and dusty! You couldn't see more dinosaurs,<1172> in fact, <1172>without a time machine. So please enjoy them all.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our art galleries, <1172>if I may say, <1172>are the very picture of perfection. Yes, the collection is complete! So peruse the portraits. <1172>Ambulate through the galleries. <1172>It's all a feast for the eyes, <1172>so please <1172>indulge!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our museum is nearly full. <1172>It brims with fish, <1172>and I wouldn't say it's infested with insects, <1172>but it's close. Yet if it's portraits or fossils you seek, <1172>those exhibits are nearing completion too. Enjoy them all.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our museum is filling up, I'll have you know. <1172>Yes, we've been feathering this nest quite nicely. So if you're in the mood for this or that, you'll be sure to find it.<1172> Visitors always leave quite satisfied.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Our collection is still growing, but you'll be delighted, <1172>I'm sure,<1172> at what we have. This museum is like a chick taking its first steps. How far we will go! Walk with us, <1172>won't you? Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta You'll find our collections are coming along nicely, <1172>though we do have a long way to go. Still, I implore you to sift through the empty spaces of our museum.<1172> What discovery awaits you! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Is there anything we don't have? Any collection left incomplete? Any exhibit less than exhaustive? Well, <1172>to tell the truth, <1172>we have absolutely nothing at the moment. But we have heart. So <1172>welcome!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Also, don't neglect our shop on the second floor. <1172>I think you'll find it quite exquisite!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Also, don't overlook our personal exhibit rooms and museum gift shop on the second floor!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Also, we are currently featuring the <25484> exhibit on the second floor. <1172>Do see it!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have two personal exhibits on the second floor.<30>The <25484> and <25484> exhibits are both delightful! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have three personal exhibits on the second floor.<30>The <25484> and <25484> exhibits are both delightful. I think the <25484> exhibit is wonderful as well.<1172> Please enjoy them all! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, we have four personal exhibits on the second floor.<30>The <25484> and <25484> exhibits are both delightful. I think the <25484> and <25484> exhibits are excellent too. <1172>Enjoy them all!
NPC Hu-ta <26><670>Hoo! Aren't you our new mayor?
NPC Hu-ta <214>I am <375>Blathers<375>, the director of this museum. It is my honor, <1172>entirely,<1172> to make your acquaintance. Our museum exhibits the very best in archaeology, <1172>the natural sciences,<1172> and artfine and otherwise. <26>Hoo! <6>There I go again. You'll find that each time I open my beak, 10 words fall out when two will do. <318>I do apologize. I've been trying to get better, but when I have a thought that takes flight...! <18>Never mind. Let me start over with, <1172>hoo, <1172>fewer words.<30><16>This museum exhibits <375>insects<375>,<1172> <375>fish<375>,<1172> <375>assessed fossils<375>, <1172>and <375>artwork<375>.<30><214>The reason? <1172>To make <107> as great as it can be.
NPC Hu-ta <16>That's it <1172>in a nutshell. You see?<1172> Short. <1172>I have done it! <1172>I have made myself more than concise. Hoo! <214>Now then, an addendum for you! Our second floor has a shop and is reserved for guest exhibits.
NPC Hu-ta But here is our problem. We are currently exhibiting...<6>nothing.<30><38>Heh. Hoo. It's a tad embarrassing.<619> <214>But perhaps you can help? Hootie hoo! <1172>You can! If you donate your precious finds to the museum, I would be eternally grateful, as would all of <107>.
NPC Hu-ta <214>We are open all day <1172>and all night,<1172> so stop by anytime! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta <214>We are open all day, all night, and every day of the year. Indeed, <1172>the <107> museum never sleeps!
NPC Hu-ta <8>.<8>.<8>.<8><26> Huh?<6> <53>It doesn't seem you have anything on your person that we can accept at the moment<8>.<8>.<8>. <16>We take bugs, fish, sea creatures, official <375>Blathers<375>-assessed fossils, and works of art. <13>If you have any of those that our museum is currently lacking...<214>we'd absolutely love the donation!
NPC Hu-ta Hmm? <214>Hoo! <1172>How may I be of service?<8740><1099> Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <214>How may I be of service?<796><1099> Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <214>How may I be of service?<8740><1099> Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <214>How may I be of service?<796><1099> Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <1172><23><670>Oh, <439>!<6> I have something <214>to discuss with you! Hoo!<30><103>We have filled all our permanent exhibits, thanks to the philanthropy of all who live in <107>! <214>Such a spirit of giving has made our halls complete!<619> <16>As such, I will no longer ask for donations. <13>But I wouldn't mind assessing a rogue fossil now and then,<8> so feel free to continue bringing those by. <16>Well then, <1172>how may I be of service?<796><1099> Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <28>May I offer any further assistance?<8740><1099> Make a donation! Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <28>May I offer any further assistance?<796><1099> Assess a fossil! Nothing...
NPC Hu-ta <214>Then please enjoy the rest of your visit!
NPC Hu-ta <214>What would you like to donate?
NPC Hu-ta <1172><26><670>Oh! My apologies! I cannot accept any donations at this moment.<30>Our town is currently being visited! I must stand vigil solely to serve the needs of visitors who wander in. <214>Can you make your donation at another time? Hoo! I thank you for your patience, <439>.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Hoo? <1172>You've changed your mind? Next time then.
NPC Hu-ta <1172><121><325><670>Eeek!<286><325><325><325><1172> A bug<325><1172><325>.<1172>.<1172>.<325><1172><325>!<286><6> <26><6>Ah,<670> I beg<31> your pardon!<6> <325>I just<1172> don't like handling these things much! <286><53>Well<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Mmm. Hoo hoo,<670> <77><834><25566>This <834> here reminds me vaguely of when I was but a chick in my mother's nest...<26> <1214><19615><1172>Oh!<670> I'm so sorry!<6> <212>I was about to get rather carried away there!<30><16>Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of this critter<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll display it later with a more detailed description, so please come back to see it. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta <1172><26><670>Hoo hoo<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> <41><77> <834><25568><670> reminds me of a time when I was still in my baby feathers<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6><26> <1214><19615><1172>Ah!<670> I beg your pardon!<6> <212>I was about to go on a tangent there!<30><16>Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of it here<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it anytime you'd like. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta <1172><26><670>Oh hoo hoo<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<670> <41><77> <834><25568><670> reminds me of a time when my dear mother tucked me under her wing<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6><26> <1214><19615><1172>Ah!<670> I beg your pardon!<6> <212>I was but a hair away from getting distracted!<30><16>Anyhoo, I promise we will take good care of it here<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it whenever you'd like. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo hoo! <6>Why, that must be <77> <834>, if I'm not entirely mistaken! <18>Yes, surely!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo! <6>Unless I'm mistaken, that is <77><834>!<6> <18>Indeed! <1172>What joy! <1172>It is!
NPC Hu-ta <72>What? <6>Hoo hoo! What luck!<1172> Is that <77><834><20547> <18>Yes, <1172>undoubtedly!
NPC Hu-ta Well, we shall take very good care of this, you have my word<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll display it later with a detailed description, so please come back to see it at any time. Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo! <6>Oh! My word, isn't that <77><834>...?<680><1214><24344>
NPC Hu-ta <1152><121>Hoo!<286><1481>
NPC Hu-ta <31>Oh dear! Upon closer examination, I have grave news to share with you, <439>! <6>It's a fake! Why, it's as clear as the difference between <355> and <4383>! Shocking! <16>I'm sorry to say I must turn down this most generous donation. Hoo, yes, <1172>I must give it back.
NPC Hu-ta <72>What? <6>Could it be? You're donating the <834>?
NPC Hu-ta <53>Let me just see here...<680> Hmmm. <6>Well... Oh...! <23><6> Hoo hoo!
NPC Hu-ta After some consideration, I declare it to be <77><834><2409> <18> Yes, without a doubt.
NPC Hu-ta Oh my! <18>Upon examination, it's most certainly <77><834>!
NPC Hu-ta Eureka! <18>Yes, most certainly. It's <77><834>!
NPC Hu-ta <214>I will be most delighted to accept your donation. Thank you!
NPC Hu-ta <26>Oh! <1172>This has already been donated! I must return this to you. <1172><214>But you have my deepest gratitude!
NPC Hu-ta <214>I'm very glad to accept your donation.
NPC Hu-ta <214>You have my thanks. <6>Hoo, if only we had the other pieces, <1172>this fine creature would be complete!
NPC Hu-ta <1172><23><15>Hoo hoo!<670> This means<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>!<6> <141>Yes, oh my! The <25585> is at last complete! <214>Ahhh<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. The <25585> is surely an amazing creature!<30><649>You know, when it comes to the <25585>, what I love most is how<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<6><1172><26> Ah!<670> I'm so sorry!<6> <212>My mind started to race with thoughts of the <25585>! <16>Anyhoo, I promise we will take excellent care of it here<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll add a detailed description as well, so please go take a look at the<1172> <25585> display soon!
NPC Hu-ta ... Hmm? Hoo? But you have no unknown fossils for me to inspect.<30><16>Sadly, <561>I cannot assess that which needs no assessing.<619> <110>Hoo! <1172>A bit of museum humor. <1172>So rich. <1172>Hoo hoo!
NPC Hu-ta <214>Hoo! What would you like me to assess?
NPC Hu-ta Hoo? <8621>No? Well, never mind. I respect your decision entirely.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Here. Let me give this back to you.
NPC Hu-ta <214>We don't have this fossil in our collection. Would you consider donating it, <439>?<849><796><1099> OK, donated! Sorry, no.
NPC Hu-ta <214>Hoo! Wonderful! <1172>I'll add it to our collection!
NPC Hu-ta Ah, yes. Well then, <1172>here you go.
NPC Hu-ta <26>Hold on! Was this possibly...?<6> Could it perhaps be...?<6> Has the dream finally come <1172>true? <23><670>Yes! The museum's collections are completely, thoroughly complete!<619> <103>Hoo! Simply stupendous! <87>No town can boast of a bigger or better collection than the one here in <107>. <214>Oh, the generosity that made this possible! My thanks to you and all who supported this dream. <141>You have my deepest gratitude. And may ALL who love this place as much as you know it too. For a museum is only as great as its patrons, and people like you have made it a most magnificent place!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo hoo! <6>This is the last of what we need for the aquarium!<30><103>How wonderful! We can now call our aquarium complete. Thank you from the depths of my heart!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo hoo! <6>Is this the last insect we need to complete our collection?<30><103>Our insect exhibit is complete! Oh, how my heart flutters just to imagine it. <121>Ick!<2289> <38>Perhaps flutters is the wrong word for it!<25609><2289> But,<8> I'll manage, I suppose. <7>It is for the greatest good and the sake of our museum,<8> <18>so you have my deepest thanks!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo hoo! <6>No, it cannot be! This is the final piece we need for our art collection! <103>Oh, now our gallery is the very portrait of perfection! I thank you for being a champion of art!
NPC Hu-ta <72>Hoo hoo! <6>What, the final fossil? Impossible... but true!<30><103>Oh, and if I may be a little dated, may I just say that I really <25614><2289> your devotion to fossils? <214>Because I most certainly do. Thanks for your commitment.
NPC Hu-ta <214>We certainly hope you'll keep up the good work!
NPC Hu-ta <5299>H<325>ooooo...<286><7739><25615><23142> <121><1172>WHO?!<24344>
NPC Hu-ta Hoooo... <6>Hmm...<1308><1099> What's wrong? Hey, hello?!
NPC Hu-ta ... Oh!<26><24344>
NPC Hu-ta Why, Mayor! I was just trying my best to solve a dilemma. But I must admit, I'm fairly stuck. Oh! <23>May I ask your thoughts on the matter?
NPC Hu-ta <16>Though our collection has grown, our museum just isn't drawing the attendance I hoped for. I know the very thing that will bring more visitors, of course.<619> <23>The museum must be remodeled! <214>We have a second floor that is going unused at the moment. It would be perfect for something fresh! Oh yes, what we need is an exhibit space where everyone in <470> can display what THEY want!
NPC Hu-ta Now <1172>my dilemma:<6> As the director here, I have big dreams for our museum<8>.<8>.<8>. but no Bells. <561>I don't have the funds to remodel the museum.<619><16> But, Mayor,<8> this place is a public service, so perhaps<8>.<8>.<8>. maybe we could have this added to the list of <375>public works projects<375> for the town? <18>Would you consider making this a priority for <107>?<8> As mayor, you can make this dream come true! <214>I'll tell your secretary, <375>Isabelle<375>, in case you'd like to help out.<6> <18>My thanks in advance, Mayor.<813>
NPC Hu-ta Why, Mayor! How fortuitous I should see you right now! Hoo!<30><31>For I am once again flummoxed, possibly even vexed, <1172>by a problem!<619> <16>If anyone can help, it's you.
NPC Hu-ta This time my dilemma involves a friend. <18>Truth be told, an old acquaintance named <375>Brewster<375>. He is a master coffee brewer.<8> <354>But this fellow has no place where he can put his skills to use! <53>So why not open a caf here in <107>? Visitors would love it.<619> <214>Imagine, <1172>if I may say, <1172>the good buzz!
NPC Hu-ta <16>Of course, <13>we now come to the problem. I cannot ever hope to build a caf on my own. <18>I'm sure my friend would delight all of <107>. I can vouch for his skills as a conjurer of coffee. But I can't say abracadabra and make this dream a reality. Hoo, what to do...
NPC Hu-ta <72>Of course, the answer is standing right before me. <619><214>You, Mayor!<1172> You have the power, hoo. A <375>caf<375> would benefit <107>! In fact, what sort of town doesn't have a proper coffeemonger? <214>Yes, I'm firmly convinced. I'll be sure to share this plan with your secretary, <375>Isabelle<375>. The fate of the caf, <1172>indeed, <1172>of my good friend too, <1172>is in your hands, Mayor. <25636><813>
NPC Hu-ta <1172><72> Hoo hoot!<6> <214>Oh, several things, I see!<619> <4074><53><1172>Let's take a look, shall we <20476> <20476> <25639>#xE;<1481>
NPC Hu-ta <1172><40> Yes!<619> <214>We will gladly take these off your hands!
NPC Hu-ta <6><121><6>HOO!<286><30><286><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>I'm afraid fake art has worked its way into the mixture of donations you just gave me<1172>.<1172>.<1172>. <16>I'm so terribly sorry, but you do understand we can't display fakes<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30><214>We'll gladly accept the remaining items for our collection, though!
NPC Hu-ta <6><121><6>HOO-WHAT?!<286><30><286><1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172>I'm afraid all of these are works of a nasty impostor<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<30>I'm so terribly sorry, but you do understand we can't display fakes. We therefore must pass on these.
NPC Hu-ta <16>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><26> Ah,<6> there's no need for you to pull them all out!<6> <214>I'll handle the rest from here! Hoot hoo!
NPC Hu-ta Also, you're donating multiples of the same item, but we only need one,<8> <18>so you may keep the extra.
NPC Hu-ta <1172>.<1172>.<1172>.<1172><26> What's this?<670> Could it be<1172>.<1172>.<1172>.?<30><72>Hootie hoo!<6> It seems a number of our collections have been completed in one fell swoop with your help! <103>What a grand happenstance! <141>Nothing makes me happier than seeing a finished collection! <214>Don't fret. We'll take good care of your wonderful donations!<30>Thank you once again for all your support and generosity!
NPC Hu-ta We pride ourselves in exhibiting all donations in a timely manner.<619> <214>Thank you very much!
NPC Hu-ta <1172><72> Ooh hoo!<6> <214>More than one, I see!<619> <4074><53><1172>Let's take a closer look <20476> <20476> <25656>#xE;<1481>
NPC Hu-ta <121>Hoo hoo!<6> All of these are rare fossils not yet found in our museum's collection <20476> <20476> . <141>What a surprise!<6> You have a knack for finding fossils, don't you?<30><16>I'm <18>incredibly jealous <20476> <20476> .<670> <53>I hope I can convince you to donate them for <107>'s cultural development <20476> <20476> . <16>In the meantime, I shall return these to you <20476> <20476> . Do think about donating them, though! Hoo!
NPC Hu-ta <121>Hoo hoo!<6> I do believe I've found something that's not yet part of our museum's collection <20476> <20476> . <141>It's really most stunning!<6> I believe you have a natural talent for fossils!<30><16>I'm <18>rather jealous <20476> <20476> .<670> <53>I hope I can perhaps convince you to assist with <107>'s cultural education <20476> <20476> . <16>In the meantime, I shall return these to you <20476> <20476> . Do think about donating, though! Hoo hoot!
NPC Hu-ta <141>Well, well<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> All of these are simply quite splendid!<8> In fact,<8> our museum already has these fossils on display! <16>If only <53>I had the funds, I'd buy them for my own personal collection<8>.<8>.<8>. <214>I suppose some dreams aren't meant to come true every day.<1172> For now, I'll give these back to you.
