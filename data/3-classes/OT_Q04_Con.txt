OT Q04 Con You don't remember?<2289> My super- important meeting with <14>?<2289> You're in charge of setting it up! <13>Don't worry.<2289> There's still time to redeem yourself,<8> <70>. <2289><7>I'm counting on you<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
OT Q04 Con Well, <8><36>it's too late to meet with <14>. <2289>I don't even need to talk to <1698>h<996>#x0;<997><998> anymore. I know you're busy,<8> <70>, <8>but <561>you should really try to avoid flaking out like this.
OT Q04 Con <26>Whoa! <2289>I was counting on you!<20879> <7>Now what?
OT Q04 Con <26><14> said <2519>s<1001>#x0; wouldn't meet with me? <20879><354><41><42>,<8> that's disappointing.
