FU Q09 Furniture <212>My <834> has been helping me relax lately.<30><214>On sleepless nights, I just stare at it. It's so calming that it helps me fall asleep.
FU Q09 Furniture <214>I don't want to brag,<8> but my <834> is quite famous. <13>I'd like for it to become a family heirloom someday.<40>
FU Q09 Furniture <214>I'm trying to create a space that keeps my mind and body healthy.<30><16>My <834> helps me relax,<8> and<214> it makes the air cleaner too.
FU Q09 Furniture <13>I totally lose track of time when I use my <834> to listen to <834>. <219>It's a big problem if I'm cooking.<6> I can't tell you how many things I've burned because of it.
FU Q09 Furniture <87>I've been watching this one show called Ten-Minute Meals. I can't wait for the next episode! <87>They're talking about how to make <117><2409> In just 10 minutes!
FU Q09 Furniture <214>Do you play any instruments, <70>?<30><219>I've been practicing and practicing.<619> <38>But I still have a ways to go before I can start a band.
FU Q09 Furniture <214>Do you mind if I brag about this perfect kitchen of mine?<30>To me,<1172> the kitchen is the most important place in a house.<30><87>Chances are,<1172> if I'm at home,<1172> I'm hanging out in the kitchen making tasty treats,<8> <42>!
FU Q09 Furniture <13>If I lie in my <834> and try to read,<1172> I always end up falling asleep. <31>I can only get through 3 pages at a time!<619> <38>That's why I've started reading while standing up.
FU Q09 Furniture <214>I decided to throw caution to the wind when I put this <834> in my room. I was worried it'd make my room feel really cramped,<8> but stretching out in bed is worth it!

FU Q09 Furniture <214>While I have you over,<8> there's something I'd like to show you.<30><219>What do you think of my <834>?<619> <13>It's not just a pet! <219>I'm not very good at catching bugs,<1172> so <13>I was hoping I'd get better after living with one for a while. I've already learned a lot from it, <42>.
FU Q09 Furniture <13>Do you ever get this sudden urge to clean in the middle of the night?<30><214>Sometimes I do.<6> I take everything out of storage,<1172> reorganize it,<1172> and put it back properly. <219>You know what I'm talking about, don't you, <70>?
FU Q09 Furniture <1833><1834><1835>

FU Q09 Furniture <13>I always set out what I'm going to wear the night before.<6> That way I don't have to rush in the morning. <214>But sometimes I forget that I laid out clothes,<8> and they end up looking like decorations. <13>I guess that's not really a bad thing, since I like all my clothes,<8> <42>.
FU Q09 Furniture <1833><1834><1835>
FU Q09 Furniture <13>Curious about what's inside of my <834>?<30><219>I'm always pulling things out and putting other things back in,<1172> so even I don't really know what's inside.
FU Q09 Furniture <214>While you're here,<8> take a close look at my <834>.<30><31>I have so many books,<8> there isn't room for any more.<6> It makes it hard to keep them all organized. <87>But I always try to put them back in alphabetical order!
