FU FreeA Always <214>Spring is the season when a young woman's fancy turns to reading new books,<8> <42>. <649>I wonder which books are out there waiting for me<8>.<8>.<8>.<619> <367>Oh!<6> Be still, my beating heart!
FU FreeA Always <214>Summer is the season for reading on the beach,<8> <42>.<30>Instead of jumping into the ocean,<8> <214>I jump into whole other worlds!
FU FreeA Always <214>Fall is the perfect season for curling up with a book,<8> don't you think?<30><214>I'm what you'd call a voracious reader,<8> <42>.<6> I've already consumed 20 books this fall!
FU FreeA Always <214>During the winter,<8> you can't beat curling up under a blanket with a good book. <649>A good book and a cup of cocoa<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> <367>That's a match made in heaven!
FU FreeA Always <6780>
FU FreeA Always <13>This might seem random, but<8> do you know what I'm thinking about right now?<441> <872> The future. Yesterday.
FU FreeA Always <1683>
FU FreeA Always <72>That's right!<619> <16>For a while now I've been thinking about how to <18>live my life on my own terms.<6> <53>But...<15>what exactly are my terms?<619> <13>I should really get to know myself better.
FU FreeA Always <26>No!<8> I'm not thinking about the future.<6> <16>I've already got enough on my mind at the moment! I'm actually wondering where I put the <54> I bought yesterday. I just can't seem to remember.
FU FreeA Always <874>
FU FreeA Always <72>You're right!<6> You know me too well.<30><16>Yesterday<8> somebody gave me some <33>,<6><38> so I'm trying to decide when I should eat it.
FU FreeA Always <561>Rather than the past,<8> my mind is filled with thoughts of the future<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><13>There's so much I want to do and not enough time to do it!<670> I'm trying to come up with a master plan.
FU FreeA Always <13>Hmm.<6> Actually,<8> do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment?<441><5435> About the world! Um...nothing?
FU FreeA Always <72>You're right!<6> <18>I've been thinking about how we can bring peace to the world. <87>And because global change starts locally,<6> for now,<1172> I'm thinking about how to bring peace to this town!
FU FreeA Always <7>What?!<6> I am so thinking!<619> <18>I'm thinking about this conversation we're having!
FU FreeA Always <13>I know this is out of the blue, but do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment?<441><878><1524> About aliens. About baby chicks.
FU FreeA Always <18>You're absolutely right.<6> I've always been fascinated by outer space.<30><367>I would love to be an astronaut and visit other planets.<6> It'd be like a space safari!
FU FreeA Always <18>Yep, you're right.<619> Baby chicks start off yellow,<1172> but their color changes as they get older<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <72>I wonder if MY color will change as I get older!
FU FreeA Always <13>This might seem sort of random,<8> but do you know what I'm thinking about at this very moment?<441><7480> Gloves. Socks.
FU FreeA Always <308><1768>
FU FreeA Always <18>That's right!<6> <16>I've been carrying my coins in this glove I don't wear anymore. But the clerks at the store always look at me funny,<8> so maybe I should get an actual change purse.
FU FreeA Always <214>That's right.<6> I've been thinking I should knit a new pair of gloves.<30><219>Last time I tried,<8> I got carried away and knit 13 fingers. Knitting is sort of mesmerizing that way.
FU FreeA Always <7485>
FU FreeA Always <18>You're right.<15> <13>The other day,<8> I went to <789>'s house and took off my shoes. <219>And I was embarrassed to discover I had a hole in my sock!<30>I didn't want <1698>h<996>#x0;<997><998> to notice,<1172> so I hid my foot,<16><8> but then I had to hop around the house on one leg. <36>On the plus side,<8> I looked so weird hopping around <670>that <2519>s<1001>#x0; didn't notice the hole in my sock.
FU FreeA Always <18>Yes, that's right.<619> <13>I've been wearing my socks to sleep at night.<30><16>But when I wake up,<1172> my socks are on the floor<8>.<8>.<8>.and my feet feel like ice. <214>So<8> I'm thinking of using duct tape around my ankles to keep my socks from slipping off in bed.

FU FreeA Always <219>Yesterday,<8> I picked up a letter that <704> must have dropped<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><31>I knew it was wrong to read it,<6> but I couldn't resist!<6> Please don't tell anyone else! I was so ashamed of myself afterward that I left the letter where I found it.<30><53>But now that I think about it<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I wonder if I should have delivered it instead.<30><31>What if someone else picked it up and read it,<8> and it's all my fault?!<680><16>
FU FreeA Always <13>I found a single rubber boot while walking to <704>'s house the other day. <214><41><704> took that boot and put some flowers in it just like a vase!<30><87>Isn't that a great idea?!<670> I think I might try it out too.
FU FreeA Always <13>The other day<8> I found a handmade kaleidoscope.<30><16>When I looked into it,<8> it didn't have beads and glass inside.<670> Instead, it was filled with rice and beans. <53>It was strange but a little bit genius too.<619> <13>No wonder it had "Property of <41><704>" written on the side.
FU FreeA Always <13>I picked up a diary that someone dropped the other day.<6> <219>I know I shouldn't have,<670> but I peeked inside. <16>It said: "Day one: Played a lot.<6> Day two: Played a lot today too.<680> Day three:<8> .<8>.<8>.Sure played a lot." <31>And it was like that on every page!<619> <36>What's the point in keeping a diary like that?!
FU FreeA Always <13>I picked up a handwritten memo on the beach yesterday.<30><16>It said:<8> "To go left, or to go right. <8>.<8>.<8>.<8>That is the question."<30>Do you think that was a serious question,<8> or was the writer feeling philosophical?<619><38> I really want to know!
FU FreeA Always <1287><1503>
FU FreeA Always <214>Lately, I've been into wearing my pajamas inside out and backward.<30><18>Ever since I started doing that,<8> I haven't had a single bad dream.
FU FreeA Always <214>My latest obsession is sleeping in the space between the bed and the wall. <18>Since I started doing that,<1172> I don't wake up with a crick in my neck.
FU FreeA Always <214>I've taken up calligraphy recently.<6> But to make it more of a challenge,<8> I do it on tissue paper! <87>I can't begin to describe how good it feels to finish a letter without tearing the paper!
FU FreeA Always <214>Can I confide in you?<619> I pressed some <240> between books to make decorations later.<30>Then the other day,<8> I mistook them for tea leaves...<30><31>And I accidentally made <704> drink my pressed-flower tea!<619><26> Please don't tell <1698>h<996>#x0;<997><998> about it!

FU FreeA Always <13>I've been stuck in a rut lately when it comes to doing laundry.<30><214>And I think changing things up a bit might make the chore seem more appealing.<30>I've already been trying new things.<441>/<7497> Like what? OK...
FU FreeA Always <728>
FU FreeA Always <214>One thing I've been doing is hanging my clothes on a scarecrow to dry.<30><38>But sometimes <704> starts talking to the scarecrow without realizing it's not me.
FU FreeA Always <214>Like hanging each item of clothing on the end of my fishing rod and drying it that way. <38>The fact that my clothes smell like the river later is all part of the fun!
FU FreeA Always <214>If you come up with any good ideas for how to spice up the whole clothes-drying thing,<8> let me know!
FU FreeA Always <13>Lately, I've been getting bored with my routine for slicing veggies<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><53>I thought, if I changed how I've been doing it, it wouldn't feel like such a chore. So I've been trying out a few things.<441>4<252>#x0; Like what? OK...
FU FreeA Always <13>I turn on <375><2495><2496><375> and slice my veggies to the beat.<30><141>I think it's improving my sense of rhythm too!
FU FreeA Always <214>If you come up with any good ideas, please let me know!
FU FreeA Always <607>;
FU FreeA Always <214>I'm curious, <70>. What kind of books do you like to read?<234><7503> Fantasy novels. Mysteries. Dictionaries.
FU FreeA Always <214>What kind of books do you like, <70>?<234><7504><1512> Picture books. Encyclopedias. Poetry collections.
FU FreeA Always <214>What kind of books do you like, <70>?<234><7505> Picture books. Mysteries. Encyclopedias.
FU FreeA Always <214>Really?<6> <87>I love a good fantasy novel.<30><214>Where else can you hang out with orcs,<8> wizards,<8> and unicorns?<6> <367>I just love unicorns.
FU FreeA Always Oh, I totally agree.<30><214>You can learn so much by reading a set of encyclopedias one volume at a time. <18>It can be a little dry,<8> but it's worth it.<6> Knowledge is priceless!
FU FreeA Always <18>I love them too!<6> They remind me of being a little kid and learning how to read. <214>That's why opening a picture book makes me feel so content.
FU FreeA Always <72>Oh, I feel the same way!<619> I try not to read them before bed, though.<30><87>Because once I start a mystery,<8> I can't stop until I know how it ends!
FU FreeA Always <214>Really?<15><13> Reading a dictionary cover to cover seems like it might get boring. <214>But there's so much to learn from a dictionary<8> that it would probably be worth it!
FU FreeA Always <18>Oh,<8> me too!<619> <214>I love how poetry can express such big ideas in just a few small words. <16>I'd love for you to share your favorite collections with me sometime.<40>
FU FreeA Always <7510>
FU FreeA Always <214>I've been studying really hard for my marmalade-making proficiency exam. Even if I don't end up making a career out of it,<8> it'll be useful for getting out of sticky situations.<40>
FU FreeA Always <214>I've been studying hard for my dictionary proficiency exam, so I've memorized lots of word definitions. <40>I can also tell you the number of pages in a whole bunch of different dictionaries!
FU FreeA Always <214>I've been studying really hard for my bread-baking proficiency exam.<30>Even if I don't end up making a career out of it,<8> it's a skill that should help me rise to the top.<40>
FU FreeA Always <214>I've been practicing really hard for my calligraphy proficiency exam.<30><40>The best part is getting to write my name on the exam paper!
FU FreeA Always <7512><7513>
FU FreeA Always <214>I read so many books, I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one. <619><23>I even have an idea for it! <87>I could write down the things you and I talk about<8> and turn that into a collection of essays.
FU FreeA Always <214>I read so many books, I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one.<30><87>That's why I'm going to write <45><70> and the Diabolical <41><1622>. <16>You'll be the main character, and it'll be a story about your friendship with <704>,<8> <42>. <214>Oh, and an evil <1622>!
FU FreeA Always <214>I read so many books, I was thinking it would be fun to try writing one.<30><87>I even have an idea! Doesn't a story called<8> <41><107>:<1172> Wild World <670>sound interesting?<441>P<7523> Sure does! Hmmm...
FU FreeA Always <214>I know!<6> <41><704> and <41><704> would be in it.<30>And it'd be about all the crazy days we spend in this one town.<30><16>Once I have a rough draft, I'll be sure to show it to you!<40>
FU FreeA Always Aw<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> I was planning to make you the main character too.<6> That's too bad.
FU FreeA Always <214>I read so many books,<6> I was thinking it'd be fun to try writing one.<441>S<7527>#x0; Yeah, it might be. You should do it!
FU FreeA Always I mean,<2261> I'd like to,<8> but there aren't a lot of story ideas to be found in my ordinary life<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <23>I'll have to start by making my life more exciting,<670> <42>.
FU FreeA Always <53>I mean,<2261> I'd like to,<8> but what should I write about<8>.<8>.<8>.<15> <23>Oh, I know!<30>I'll interview all my friends <214>and turn their answers into a children's book.<6> How does that sound? <53>I just need to come up with some really tough,<1172> probing questions.<6><7> Hard-hitting stuff!
FU FreeA Always <7530>^
FU FreeA Always <214>Do you like writing letters, <70>?<441>Y<7531>#x0;( Sure do! Not really.
FU FreeA Always <87>I knew you would!<6> I love reading and writing letters too.<30><219>But sometimes, even though I put a lot of effort into writing one...<30> I just can't figure out what to write last,<6> so I end up never mailing it.<6><13>
FU FreeA Always <72>I see.<15><619><13> Chatting face-to-face is fun, but sometimes I like to organize my thoughts by writing them down.
FU FreeA Always <214>I really enjoy writing letters.<670> What about you, <70>?<441>\<7534>#x0;( I do too. Not really.
FU FreeA Always <18>I thought you would.<6> <214>You have that<1172> letter-writing look to you.<30><16>Sometimes it's hard to tell people how you feel directly,<670><214> and it's easier to be forthright in a letter.
FU FreeA Always <16>Oh, I see.<619> <214>I find it handy to include a present with my letter if I've been too busy to visit someone.
FU FreeA Always <214>Do you like getting letters, <70>?<441>_<7535>#x0;( I sure do! Not really.
FU FreeA Always <87>I love getting them too!<30><214>It's fun to chat face-to-face,<8> but I like being able to read my favorite letters more than once.
FU FreeA Always <13>Oh, I see<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><16>I guess when I write to you, <214>I'll have to write about something that will really grab your attention!
FU FreeA Always <214>When this season rolls around,<8> it always makes me think of the same thing<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
FU FreeA Always <7538><7539>
FU FreeA Always <7541>
FU FreeA Always <214>My mom used to make us soup using these little spring vegetables.<30><87>She'd gather them up while thinning out the garden, and let them simmer all day on the stove<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <16>Someday I'd like to taste <367>the soup of my memories again.
FU FreeA Always <214>The strawberry jam my mom would make for us!<619><87> I liked eating it on top of her freshly baked bread. <367>Just thinking about it is making me wistful<97><334> and hungry.
FU FreeA Always <7543>
FU FreeA Always <214>Sometimes my dad would bring home a watermelon for us.<30><87>We'd let it chill in the fridge for a while and then slice it into wedges.<30><649>Add a sprinkle of salt, <1172>take a bite, and <670>mmm!<6> <214>It's one of my favorite memories of summer.
FU FreeA Always <214>My mom would make salads with fresh tomatoes from our garden.<30><87>The dressing she'd make to go with them was just delicious<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <214>I should try making it sometime.
FU FreeA Always <7545>
FU FreeA Always <214>The apples I'd pick with my parents!<6> <87>They'd make a caramel sauce to eat with them that was the best!
FU FreeA Always <214>My dad's recipe for garlic mashed potatoes!<30><87>The combination of fluffy potatoes,<1172> butter,<1172> and savory garlic just can't be beat!
FU FreeA Always <7547>
FU FreeA Always <214>My mom's veggie stew!<619> <649>It would simmer all day long,<8> and the smell of it just made my mouth water.
FU FreeA Always <214>My dad's potato gratin.<619> <87>It was warm and creamy, making it the perfect food for a cold winter's day!
FU FreeA Always s<3114>#x0;
FU FreeA Always <13>I've been making sandwiches for lunch lately,<1172> but <16>they don't taste like the ones my mom used to make. <214>I think her not-so-secret ingredient was a little bit of love.
FU FreeA Always The other day<1172> I packed a picnic lunch, but I forgot to pack any napkins! <16>It was so messy that I wound up using leaves instead<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><619> <110>I kind of felt like a wild animal!<15><13>
FU FreeA Always <214>Do you like baking, <70>?<441>v<7551>#x0;( I sure do! Meh.
FU FreeA Always <87>I knew you would!<6> I love baking too. <214>We should trade baking tips<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30>So here's one for you:<16><6> make sure your cake is completely cool before you frost it!
FU FreeA Always <38>Aw, that's too bad.<6> <214>I was hoping we could have an oven-cleaning party,<8> <42>.
FU FreeA Always <7553>}
FU FreeA Always <214>Don't you think laundry dried outside smells like the sun?<30><87>It smells so good,<8> sometimes I'll fall asleep with my head buried in the laundry basket.
FU FreeA Always <214>My mom always said to shake out your clothes before hanging them up to dry. <18>It helps to prevent wrinkles.<6><13> Not that wrinkles in your clothes are the end of the world.<15><16> Stains are.
FU FreeA Always The other day,<1172> I put too much detergent in the washing machine.<30><31>The bubbles overflowed and flooded the whole room with me in it!<30><13>On the bright side,<8> it sort of felt like floating in lavender clouds.
FU FreeA Always <28>Do you ever make snowmen, <70>?<30><214>First roll up two snowballs for the head and body.<30>Then put them on top of each other,<8> and you've got yourself a snowman!<30><16>It's kind of hard to make one that's perfectly balanced,<1172> but <18>I bet you're pretty good at it.
FU FreeA Always <28>Do you ever make snowmen, <70>?<30><214>First roll up two snowballs for the head and body.<30>Then put them on top of each other,<8> and you've got yourself a snowman!<30><16>I hear snowmen of different sizes have different personalities.<6> <40>Isn't that neat?
