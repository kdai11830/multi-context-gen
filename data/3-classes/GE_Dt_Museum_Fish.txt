GE Dt Museum_Fish <214>I wish I could swim like a fish. Then everyone would think I was a mermaid, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Fish <87>I know my moves are pretty great, but I'd do anything if I could be as slick as a fish, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Fish <367>I totally love visiting all the fish in here. It's like having even MORE friends, <42>!
GE Dt Museum_Fish <214>This place is so cool. Is this what it's like to live under the sea, <42>?
GE Dt Museum_Fish <31>I'm suddenly SO hungry! I should get out of here before I grab a yummy fish, <42>!
