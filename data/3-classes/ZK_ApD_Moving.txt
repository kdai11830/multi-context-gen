ZK ApD Moving <367>I so love this time of year, when winter melts away and spring is, <1172>well, <1172>springing. <13>It's a good time to make changes in your own life, <1172>right? <619>So I'm thinking of moving out of town. <7>I know it's sad, but I'm not sure I've ever really fit in here, <70>. <13>So I'm going to be taking off on the <959> day of this month. Just wanted to let you know.<441><19351> Don't go! OK, thanks.
ZK ApD Moving <7>So you know how spring brings a real mixture of stuff? Sun and rain? Flowers and mud? I've got some news that falls into the rain-and-mud category.<619> I'm moving out of town, <70>. <31>I knowit's beyond belief! But I've made up my mind! <619><16>Wait. Aren't you surprised? <36>Well, I guess I haven't been the friendliest neighbor. Anyway, I'm going on the <959> of this month.<441><19351> Don't go! OK, thanks.
ZK ApD Moving So, <70>, I'm blowing out of town soon, <1172>like petals on the wind. I know, <1172>poetic. Yeah, I'm pulling up roots and moving away, <70>. <561>I don't think people here really got me. But I wanted to be sure to tell you,<1172> out of everyone here, <1172>that I'm moving on the <959> of this month.<441><19351> Don't go! OK, thanks.
ZK ApD Moving So, <70>, I'm blowing out of <107> soon, <1172><50>like leaves on an autumn breeze. <18>Yeah, I'm moving out of town. I never fit in here very well. But I tried, <70>! <7>I'm going to turn over a new leaf somewhere else. So my plan is to move on the <959> of this month.<441><19351> Don't go! OK, thanks.
ZK ApD Moving <214>So I've got some big news, <70>. I'm moving away from <107> soon. <7>Do you think people will miss me? I know I'll miss everyone, at least.<30>I'm making my big exit on the <959> of this month. At least that's the plan, <42>.<441><19351> Don't go! OK, thanks.

ZK ApD Moving Wow, if you feel THAT strongly.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Maybe I shouldn't be moving!<619> <87>Yeah, I'll stay in town, <70>! <13>Let's try to be better friends, OK? I know I will, <42>.
ZK ApD Moving Really? You want me to stay? I gotta admit, I didn't think you'd care all that much, <70>. <13>But I hoped you would! Looks like I'll HAVE to stay! <18>Yeah, you've convinced me, <42>! <87>Best friends F<8>-O<8>-R<8>-E<8>-V<8>-E<8>-R!
ZK ApD Moving What, you think I should stay? But, wait.<1172>.<1172>.<1172> Really? You're not just saying that, <70>? <13>I wasn't sure you'd even miss me. Wow, I'm so glad I talked to you.<619> Because now I'm staying! <16>I'm getting sort of choked up by all this, so that's all I'm going to say, <42>. <13>Anyway, <1172>thanks.

ZK ApD Moving <121>Waitwhat? Aren't you going to try to convince me to stay? I thought we were friends! <36>Well, or at least good neighbors. But maybe I didn't make that obvious enough, <42>. <13>You know what? I'm going to stick around longer, <70>. I think we could be better friends!
ZK ApD Moving <121>Hey, wait a second! Aren't you going to tell me to stay? I thought we were good friends! <13>Didn't you know that? Well, maybe I should be an even BETTER friend then, <42>. <87>Yeah, I'm staying! <6>Maybe we can be the good friends that I, <1172>uh,<1172> thought we were!
ZK ApD Moving We've been really good friends, <70>. I thought you might actually ask me not to move. But I guess that's how good our friendship is. You know I just need to do this. <616>Thanks for being my friend here. I've still got some time until I move, so come and visit me, OK?
ZK ApD Moving <13>It's been good being your neighbor. We've still got some time together, so let's make it count, all right?
