GE Ai MidWinter1 <214>Well, good evening to you!<6> Hey! Did I fake you out?<6> <110>Because it's still MORNING! Yeah, it's the <375>Winter Solstice<375> today!<6> <214>Wow, it's going to be super weird being dark all day, <70>.
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214><41><613>Hey, hey, HEY<614>! <31>Are you freaking out as much as I am this morning, <70>? <16>The sun never rose! And it's not going to today! Because it's the <375>Winter Solstice<375>! CRAZY!
GE Ai MidWinter1 Good morning!<6> Yeah, no joke! It's morning! But it's still, like, night, right? It's going to be dark all... day... long. Because it's the <375>Winter Solstice<375>, <42>!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214>I guess this whole <375>Winter Solstice<375> thing means it's dark even in the middle of the day, <42>. <87>That means I'll have to shine extra bright today to light up <107>! Right, <70>?
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214><41><613>Woohoo<614>! It'll be like night all day long today! Know what that means, <70>? <87>We gotta burn the candle at both ends today, and dance like there's no tomorrow, <42>!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214>How's it going today? Have you heard the sun's not coming up today, <70>? <53>Of course, that means it's not going down either. It'll be night all day long! How weird is THAT?
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214>Hey, good evening, <70>!<6> <53>Wait... if it was dark this morning, can I still say good evening tonight? <214>The <375>Winter Solstice<375> always makes me super confused, <70>!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <214>Today's the <375>Winter Solstice<375>, so the sun never rose today. It's like it had a bad-hair day and didn't show up!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <41><613>Woohoo<614>!<6> Can you BELIEVE it? This has been, like, the longest night ever. <40>The sun didn't come up today! I love the <375>Winter Solstice<375>. It's like an upside-down kinda day!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <13>Not too many hours left in the most awesome night of the year, <70>! The sun hasn't come up in forever. But it will eventually. <214>So enjoy the super nightiness while it lasts!
GE Ai MidWinter1 <13><41><613>Woohoo<614>!<6> I love the <375>Winter Solstice<375>. You know why, <70>? <110>Because the forecast is "dark with no chance of light"! Hahaha!
