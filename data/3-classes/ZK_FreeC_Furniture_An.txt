ZK FreeC Furniture_An So <7757><2289> uses a double bed<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><53>Judging from her behavior,<20879> I'd say she needs it because she tosses and turns a lot. I toss and turn a lot too, <36>but only because it helps me get exercise when sleeping!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Huh? <8><7757><2289> lives on her own, right?<619> <53><2289>So how come she has that <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8>? Ahh,<2289> I see<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <18>Normal people have couches that seat more than one. Right, I get it now...
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <7>Listen up, <8><70>!<20879> When you see someone's chair,<2289> you can somehow guess that person's taste in things. <53><38749><48>'s house<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <26>It's <77><834>, huh? <38>See?<2289> Now can't you just picture her entire decorating style? <25>My methods never lie,<8> <42>!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <649><2289>The <834> in <48>'s house, huh<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><18>There might be some avant-garde clothing inside, or maybe just a shirt or something,<8> <42>.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <41><77><834><38755><48>'s clothes for special occasions?<20879> <36>Well, I give her fashion sense a pass for now! <44>Heh heh heh<671>.<671>.<671>.<671> Did I just sound like a famous fashion designer?<21914>#x4;Gracie<375>, <319> eat your heart out!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <41><77><834><38758><18844>#xE;<48> may act like she doesn't care about looks,<20879> <44>but I can see her true feelings!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An Earlier<20879> I discovered a book called <2058> on the <834>.<8>.<8>. <38>I'd never have guessed, but it looks like <48> is into more advanced reading<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <25>I used to be a speed-reader, by the way. Had the highest reading speed back in <46> school. Problem was that I read so fast <38>I couldn't remember anything I read.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh,<8> <48> made some tea for us,<8> <70>!<30><38>I thought she wasn't into that sort of thing,<8> but I guess I had her all wrong!<8> <41><42>!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An Look, <70>!<2289> Do you see the <834> there<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>?<30><26>Oh! <38><48> might think we're rude if we just keep staring at it,<8> <70>.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Huh? <2289>I wonder if <48> <16>knows how to actually use the <834>.<8> <38>I worry she'll end up breaking it<8>.<8>.<8>.<20879> <110>In fact,<8> it may already be broken!<20879> Hah ha!<20879><214>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <214>Ahh,<8> <77><834><2409><2289> Definitely my favorite type of flower,<8> even more than the others<8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><219>I wonder if <48> decorated the house just for me.<30><141>Heh heh heh.<2289> I guess she knew I'd be visiting today,<8> <42>!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <7>Ah ha! <48>'s <834><38769><2289> but at the same time I'm kinda curious!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh,<18844>#xE;<48> apparently has <77><834><38772>Huh. I wouldn't expect her to use that. I mean, she probably has better things to do.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh,<18844>#xE;<48> has a real, working <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8><30><13>Mmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> Interesting!<20879> A girl like her<8> getting into games?<30><44>I bet she couldn't beat my high score, though!<4115>#x0;<3142>For which game? <38776><2289> <40>Hah ha!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <38>Hey,<2289> this is interesting!<20879> There's a cute <834><8> in <48>'s room<8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <13>I guess she puts on a tough attitude, but she's not without her softer, gentler side. <40>Like me,<8> <42>!

ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26><41><77><834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8> I didn't know <48> knew the stork! <38>I mean, I'm sure he's busy, but I wish he'd stop by and see me instead.<20879> <40>Hah ha!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh, wow,<8> there's a really nice <834><38783><38784>#xE;<2289> Maybe <48> is my ideal best friend! <18>Her taste in furniture sure says so!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh my.<18844>#xE;<48> has her <834> just set up in the middle of the room<8><8>.<8>.<8>.<8> <8><41><70>, let's not stare at it.<20879> That might be sort of rude, yeah? Rude and very confusing.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Oh, weird!<8> I wonder why there's <77><834><1330><2289> in <48>'s house. Maybe for guests<8>.<8>.<8>.?<20879> <13>Wow,<2289> even I'm not that accommodating for guests!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <38>Heh heh heh.<2289> That's quite surprising!<20879> I didn't expect to see a girly item like that <834><8>.<8>.<8>.<8> I guess <48> isn't so opposed to the charm of a good, fruity piece of furniture. <13>Maybe this means she's been taking my decorating advice?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An Ah, <77><834><2810><2289> but I wonder if <48> is part of a band. <38>I always feel like she would break any instrument the moment she picked it up<8>.<8>.<8>.<8>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <32205>
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <367><2289>Mmm. Smells like <48><8>.<8>.<8>.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <18>I see.<6> So this is <48>'s room! <141>Yeah, it's got a nice vibe to it!
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <38>Heh heh.<670> <41><70>!<680> If you keep looking around like that,<6> it's kind of rude to <48>, don't you think?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <26>Wait<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><53><2289> Somehow it smells like <117> in here<8>.<8>.<8>.<680> <28>Or am I just imagining things again?
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <25>Heh. This is <48>'s room!<680> Make yourself at home,<8> <70>!<30><38>Well,<8> I guess it's weird for ME<6> to say something like that<8>.<8>.<8>.
ZK FreeC Furniture_An <38>Heh heh heh.<670> I wonder if all the furniture here is stuff <48> picked out herself!
