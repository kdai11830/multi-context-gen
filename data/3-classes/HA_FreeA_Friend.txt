HA FreeA Friend Friendship between guys sometimes becomes a rivalry, doesn't it?<30><7>It's, like, that I-have-to-be-the-best mentality drives some guys to compete!<30><16>For example, <48> and <14> seem like they have that sort of thing going on. <53>What the heck are they always arguing about, anyway?
HA FreeA Friend Friendship between women is different than friendship between guys, don't you think? <53>It seems like the ladies really enjoy talking about relationships.<30><16><41><48> and <14> are always talking about stuff like that.<30><36>Come to think of it, those two probably have some good things to say about that stuff. <8><41><42>!
HA FreeA Friend Hey, did you notice?<6> <294>It seems like <48> and <14> are always cooking something up!<30><44>They look more like conspirators than pals, if you know what I mean! <8><41><42>!<30><649>They could be planning a major prank! <15>I better keep an eye on 'em.
HA FreeA Friend <31>Man, I need a jogging buddy!<30><214>I need someone who can take off for a run at the drop of a hat!<30>Someone I can just be myself with!<30><53>Like <48> and <14>! That's exactly what I need!<30><110>Ha ha! I can't imagine the two of them jogging together, though! <15><13>
HA FreeA Friend <41><48> and <14> seem to have such a formal relationship. <30><7>To really get to know someone, sometimes you really have to go toe-to-toe in an argument. <26>Whoa!<6> But if it came to fisticuffs,<15><31> they'd probably level this town!
HA FreeA Friend <53>Just a guy and a girl hanging out together is enough to get rumors started, isn't it? But I think I might have read too much into <48> hanging out with <14>. <214>I saw them the other day, and I was like, "How are the lovebirds doing?"<30>They laughed at me and said I just don't get it.<15><354> Darn! I'm so awkward sometimes, <8><42>!
HA FreeA Friend <41><48> and <14> argue all the time!<619> I guess they just have a personality clash<8>.<8>.<8>.<30><87>But, hey! A team is more fun with different kinds of people!
HA FreeA Friend <679>Yikes! <41><48> and <14> went at it again!<30><31>I've never seen such an intense verbal sparring match between two women before! <354>No matter how hard I train, I'll never be able to compete at that level, <8><42>!
HA FreeA Friend I saw <48> and <14> having quite an animated discussion a while back. Some guys just don't know how to argue with women, <8><42>!<30><7>These days you have to train your vocabulary muscles as well as your bod!
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with <48>?<30><87>He's my good friend! He's a guy with a real backbone, so I like to train with him! <7>But he's also a serious rival, and I can't let him get the best of me! <8><41><42>!
HA FreeA Friend <214>There is one person in this town I have to take my hat off to! Other than you, I mean<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> Can you guess who it is?<30><8>.<8>.<8>.<6><30><287>Beeeeep!<6> Time's up! <40>The answer is <48>!<15><30><87>I have nothing but praise for that dude. <8><41><42>?
HA FreeA Friend <53>Hey, was <48> talking about me?<30>We had a big fight the other day. It was over something really stupid too. <214>Neither of us would back down! We're both so stubborn.<30><110>Ha ha! Sorry for complaining! The two of us are pretty tight. I'm sure we'll iron it out, <8><42>!<15><13>
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with <48>? <30><214>Yeah, he's a good bro. I feel like he's somebody I can talk about silly stuff with, <8><42>! <110>Haha! You should talk to him more!<15><13>
HA FreeA Friend Um<8>.<8>.<8>.<6>are you close with <48>, <70>?<30>I'm on OK terms<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><561> But I think we could probably be better pals.<30><110>I mean, he's kind of an interesting guy, right?<15><13>
HA FreeA Friend <7><41><48> is awful, isn't he?!<15> He told me working out was a waste of time! <287>Grrrrrr! What does he know? He's so immature!<30><18>So now I'm gonna train my butt off!<6> <7>Then I'm gonna hurdle right over his head and prove how skilled I am!
HA FreeA Friend <31>Hey! Could you tell me how I should approach <48> socially?<30><16>I don't know if we just move along at different paces or have different world views or what<8>.<8>.<8>. <354>But no matter what I say to him, his response is always cool. Maybe we just aren't a good match<8>.<8>.<8>.
HA FreeA Friend Are you tight with <48>?<30><110>I talk to her a lot, and it seems like we never have any weirdness between us! <212>I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but I think we're becoming really close friends! <15><30><214>I bet if you talk to her, you'd be close with her too!
HA FreeA Friend Hey, are you tight with <48>? 'Cause I feel like I am.<30><110>When the two of us get to talking, we just can't stop!<15><13><30><26>I'm not a chatterbox, am I?<6><214> Naw, I'm pretty sure it's a two-way conversation, <8><42>!
HA FreeA Friend <53>Hey<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><28> Has <48> said anything to you recently, <70>? <30> A while back, the two of us were just talking, and then all of a sudden we were fighting! Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I don't know what to do.<30><214>Well, we both tend to forget about stuff like that the next day, so maybe I shouldn't worry about it.
HA FreeA Friend <28>Are you and <48> on pretty good terms?<30><53>I should talk to her more.<15><214> I feel like she's somebody I would get along with!<30><87>If she understands my muscles, we'll be golden!
HA FreeA Friend Recently I've been thinking about the best way to talk to <5166>We'll say hi to each other now and then, but I can never say anything to get the conversation going. <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6><110> Maybe I'll ask her to try <32> with me!<15><13>
HA FreeA Friend <28>What kind of person is <5329>I got in an argument with her a little while ago, and now I understand her even less. <7>When I get into situations like this, I always end up working out and forgetting about everything else!
HA FreeA Friend <53>Hmm<8>.<8>.<8>.<6> I wonder if <48> likes me.<30><16>When I go jogging, she yells stuff like, "You can do it!"<30><31>It's kinda weird because she used to be so cold to me!<30><16>She's full of surprises.<15><354> The other day when I was out running, she actually sprinted past me!
