			<original>Seaweed can be over three feet
long. When its spores attach to
rocks, they take root and grow.
Seaweed is naturally brown but
turns to the dark-green color we
associate it with when cooked.
It tends to spoil easily when picked,
so various preservation methods
have been developed as a necessity.
Such methods of preservation are
sprinkling ash and drying it out, or
boiling it and adding salt.</original>

They grow in warm oceans and are
