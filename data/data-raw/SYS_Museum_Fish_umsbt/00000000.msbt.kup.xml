			<original>Crucian carp are fairly easy fish for
beginners to catch, but they're also
popular with veteran anglers.
They are related to koi and can live
up to 15 years, making them a great
fish to keep in a pond.
Male offspring are seldom born,
so females significantly outnumber
males, making populations suffer.
Luckily, females can reproduce with
males of some other species, so the
problem is relatively temporary.</original>

Their lanterns, which they sway
back and forth to lure prey, can
emit light thanks to special bacteria.
When prey gets near, they shoot a
luminescent liquid and snatch the
prey while it's blinded by the light.
Only females possess the useful
lantern. They can grow to be about
two feet by maturity.
Males are small, less than two
inches in length.</original>

			<original>Tuna can reach almost 10 feet in
length and weigh over 800 pounds,
which is huge in the fish world.
Combining this great size with their
good flavor makes them literally the
biggest catch for most anglers.
Tuna can't breathe when they aren't
moving, so their entire lives revolve
around constantly swimming.
To sleep, they merely slow down.
This ability to swim while sleeping
is a huge advantage.
They're also rather fast, capable of
beating both sets of fins so hard
they reach speeds of 50 mph.</original>

			<original>Though you wouldn't guess it

Unlike normally slim and sleek

wide, silver bodies.
Surprisingly, though, these fish

tend to live in warmer places.
Their jaw strength is great enough
to bite off a person's finger, so be
very careful when fishing for them!</original>

			<original>The hammerhead shark is a shark

With their eyes positioned on the

can see in almost all directions.
Oddly, their nose holes are located
right next to their eyes on their
hammer section.
They have a number of small holes
on the front and lower portions

These holes allow them to detect
prey, even fish hiding below them
and out of sight.
While they eat a nice array of fish,
it seems rays are their favorite
